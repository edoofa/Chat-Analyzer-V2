09/09/23, 9:34 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Lorraine,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
09/09/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 296 3164: We all good sir, and yourself, hope you in good spirit as well
04/10/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?
04/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 296 3164: We all good sir, thank you, and yourself
04/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Thank you once again for sharing the history of the World Icon Mahatma Gandhi
04/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you and your family are doing well. It's wonderful to know that you've been keeping in good health and high spirits. I am well too thank you for asking. 

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians. With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.
04/10/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Thank you so much for enlightening us, she too will be a proud Edoofian. We hope the process of her enrolment will sail through smoothly
04/10/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Before we commence our discussion, I would like to reiterate an update to you about my operational hours, which span from *2:00 pm to 10:30 pm CAT*. I kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots. 

Our discussion sessions have been meticulously organized within these windows to ensure engaging and fruitful conversations. May I safely assume that you've taken note of our designated discussion hours?

Given our strong enthusiasm and meticulous preparation to advance your admission process, I would greatly appreciate your confirmation of your readiness to embark on this journey. So, may I kindly inquire if you are prepared to initiate the admission process at this time?
04/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Lorraine is still at school, you are chatting with her dad, she will respond once she gets home
04/10/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Lorraine may face some difficulties in attending our session due to study activities. I kindly request both you and Lorraine to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 296 3164: We can proceed sir
04/10/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear, and I'm thrilled to know you're ready to kickstart your admission process. Your commitment to this journey is greatly appreciated. 

Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 296 3164: That's very true, it's BCom, but am surprised she isn't in this group, I hope you will add her
04/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!

Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

09/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Good afternoon sir, our weekend wasn't bad, we hope you had a good one too, unfortunately Lorraine is writing her A level exams, she won't be in a position to attend the session.
09/10/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing great, thank you for asking. Thank you for letting me know. It is alright, as this is the family discussion group. We could also proceed with the parents as well.
09/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 296 3164: We can proceed
09/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
09/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Offer letter is given by universities of her choice after they have accepted her application. In the offer letters, the university will highlight  scholarship fees, tuition and accommodation fees
09/10/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Thank you so much, we are very much excited
09/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 296 3164: We are ready sir, and thank you once again for the enlightenment
09/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 296 3164: We are together sir, you can proceed
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing her seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning her as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 296 3164: That's a plus for her (Lorraine). We will try our best to have her amongst the first intakes
09/10/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that yes it is Lorraine excuse me for the error. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 296 3164: That's wonderful sir, most appreciated
09/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 77 296 3164: It resonate very well, thank you
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 296 3164: We are on the same page,  well articulated
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 296 3164: I think everything is clear,  but we will thrive/ try our best to settle the payment at once if our cash inflows permit
09/10/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 296 3164: You can provide more information if possible
09/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 296 3164: There is greater benefit for sure,
09/10/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 296 3164: I do agree 100%, but I hope she will put maximum effort in her exams to pass at first seating
09/10/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that she will. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Very clear
09/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 296 3164: It's clear
09/10/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Well understood
09/10/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 296 3164: That's clear, but we hoping for the best
09/10/23, 6:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Everything seems clear
09/10/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Lorraine's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Lorraine is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Yes sir
09/10/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Lorraine's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Thank you for all the effort
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lorraine.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by Galgotias University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!

15/10/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 296 3164: 1. Semester tuition after scholarship is 900usd          2. Duration of course is 3 years comprising of 6 semesters                                 3. Admission fee is 300usd                                   4. Registration fee is 750usd
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 6:48 am - +263 77 296 3164: Am very sorry about, hope you are feeling much better
16/10/23, 6:48 am - +263 77 296 3164: Good morning, it's very clear
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lorraine!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Thank you 😀
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 296 3164: That's understandable and I will leave this for Lorraine to choose her best option when she is back home, we will  discuss together as a family. Thank you for the guidance
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Yes, we stay in Harare
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Contact received, thank you
16/10/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
16/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Please do, thank you
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 296 3164: So the total will be $675.00 we use Mr. Charles' FBC account
16/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Thank you
16/10/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right! Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 296 3164: If we choose her to stay at campus the figure will be higher than $2800
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, in that case, the figure will depend on the type of on-campus accommodation that you will choose. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Very clear
16/10/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Very clear
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
16/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 296 3164: That's a great idea
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 690 1195: Greetings  .. how are you 

I am sorry for replying late because l had an examination in the afternoon  
I would prefer staying on campus accommodation
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lorraine!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand. I am sre that you must have done very well in your exam. Moving ahead, It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
17/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 296 3164: Good afternoon, Lorraine is at school now, am she will respond if she has any questions, as for me am satisfied
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.
