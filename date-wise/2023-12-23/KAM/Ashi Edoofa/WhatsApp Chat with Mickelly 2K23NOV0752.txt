All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

21/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good Afternoon .Sorry for late replies
21/11/23, 12:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries about the timing; we understand everyone has their commitments. We're just thrilled to have you on board with us. Now, Mickelly, could you please provide me with insight into this message, dear?
21/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My name is Mickelly Mpukuta .l am very passionate about Legislative law as l have seen loved ones being oppressed because of huge  economic gaps .l intend to make my community a better place  for everyone since l come from an ecomically challenged background .That is where my passion rooted.

We are five in my family and l am the first daughter.l come from the outskirts of Harare in Riverside where there is temporary housing and it is a rural setting with no electricity or tapped water.My father is a general nurse .My mother is currently unemployed and she gets seasonal part time projects to work on .Her salary is not consistent, so the seven of us solely depend on my father's income .

The only people involved in shaping my educational plans and aspirations are my parents who also have four of my siblings and my grandparents depending on them .Therefore without a reasonable amount of assistance , getting well educated is unfeasible for me .
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this! Mickelly, your dedication to making a difference through legislative law despite facing economic challenges speaks volumes about your strength and determination. Your passion to create a better environment for your community is truly inspiring.

Your family's situation, residing in an area without basic amenities like electricity or tapped water, highlights the hurdles you've faced. Your father's profession as a nurse, despite being commendable, comes with its own set of financial challenges, especially with your mother's employment being inconsistent. It's evident that your family faces financial strain, making it challenging to afford higher education without external support.

Your commitment to your aspirations despite these challenges is admirable. Your parents' role in supporting your education while managing a household with multiple dependents showcases their dedication and the sacrifices they've made to provide for the family.
21/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here at Edoofa, we acknowledge the importance of education and the transformative power it holds. We're committed to supporting students like you who strive for a better future despite facing obstacles.
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you very much
21/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, dear. Now, may I know your parents' names and the number they would be using in this group to connect with us?
21/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My mother 's name is Christina Dhliwayo and her number is +263 771 499 307.
21/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 337 9287: My father 's name is Leveke Seremanj and his number is +263 773 160 534
21/11/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: It is well noted.
21/11/23, 12:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.

21/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Oky .We can proceed.
21/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
21/11/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Mickelly 2K23NOV0752)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
21/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I clearly understand .Thank you .
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
21/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you .
21/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Through my counseling sessions ,aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship programme that l am particularly impressed about are : firstly the Earn while you Learn programme .It surely helps students to cover some of the expenses.Also that there are also exposed to career guidance,some of the students need to be directed to the right career path.They are exposed to insights of their jobs like they don't base only on theory learnt in lectures .
21/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Also the Edoofa helps the students through all the processes and a parent is assured that his or her child is in good hands .
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your appreciation of the Earn While You Learn program is well-founded. The program serves as a significant pillar in assisting students to manage some expenses while gaining practical insights into their chosen careers. This practical exposure beyond classroom theory is invaluable, providing students with a realistic understanding of their future professions.

Moreover, the emphasis on career guidance is crucial. Directing students toward the right career path is pivotal in ensuring their academic journey aligns with their aspirations. Edoofa recognizes the importance of this guidance and aims to provide comprehensive support not only academically but also in preparing students for the professional world.
21/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

21/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome!
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Very clear.
22/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am following
22/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 337 9287: They are all clear .Thank you
22/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes please
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
22/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Please share the videos

23/11/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identifying reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I did understand them .
27/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
27/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:30 PM.
27/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
29/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good evening
29/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you
29/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Good Evening, Thank you for getting back to us.
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: Good morning .
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: The difference between rights and duties is that rights are associated with freedom ,one has the liberty to do what they .They protect people from oppression whereas duties are associated with responsibilities that is to take liability for something.They are actions which people expect one to do.Human rights are the rights being given to one  by birth or being alive for example the right to eat ,where as civil rights are  obtained by being a citizen of a certain country for example if one works without being paid he or she has the right to report the person to the police (Labour Act).
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: Human rights are derived from natural law whilist civil law is found in constituition.
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: 3.Difference between prosecutor and an Attorney is based on that a prosecutor works to prove that a person commited a crime whilist an attorney fights for the right of the accused.He defend the accused of a crime ,he maybe hired by someone or work for the court .Prosecutor works to protect the public .
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: A prosecutor deal with criminal matters where as an attorney can go as far as civil matters
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: 4.l am mostly interested in pursuing corporate law because  in our community people are paying money to the wrong people who claim that they own the land we live .The area is not yet developed for a long time because of the barrier .Also my mom's who was devastated because of the properties she bought but when the person died,she left the properties to someone .It was struggle for her to get back her properties .This inspired me to pursue corporate law.
04/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 337 9287: 5.The  skills that l have that l believe will make me a successful lawyer are ,the ability to work with others which is teamwork .Personally l believe if people work together it becomes easier and you solve the problem quick .l remember at school as we got  into groups trying to work together and even at home as a family .Observing and analysing is another skill ,l got the skill from Literature .One can read in-between the lines and study a person .Reading and writing .l have always been a reader since  l was young and l have  read many novels.This helped my vocabulary and knowledge .

04/12/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Mickelly!

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good evening to you .l am doing fine thank you
04/12/23, 6:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 337 9287: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: The information is accurate.
04/12/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am ready.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am aware of that .
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 337 9287: He did told me .
04/12/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes we are on the same page .
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/12/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Well noted
04/12/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/12/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Okay.l get you
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I don't have any questions
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you  once again .
05/12/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good evening to you too,l am ready for the session
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
05/12/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 337 9287: As for me ,l am very excited .
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I hope so too
05/12/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
05/12/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/12/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am very thankful for all you are doing for us the students to secure our future
05/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/12/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am done ,you can proceed
05/12/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/12/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
05/12/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/12/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 337 9287: This is wonderful .
05/12/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/12/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/12/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I fully understand that and it's quite good .
05/12/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
05/12/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Well noted .
05/12/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to have our session productively today. However, thank you for being available. I really appreciate you being online with me. As my available hours are coming to an end and it was a long day for me, let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
05/12/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you so much .It was a pleasure having this discussion with you .
06/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
06/12/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good evening .Thank you for keeping us updated .
14/12/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Mickelly!

It has been a while now, and I am happy to let you know that I am back. Please, how are you doing today?
14/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good Afternoon ,sure it has been long .l am doing fine ,thank you.
It's good to have you back .
14/12/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
14/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes ,l am ready to proceed with the session
14/12/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/12/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/12/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 25, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Well noted .
14/12/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Please do inform me.
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I understand
14/12/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 337 9287: That is true
14/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 337 9287: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes l agree
14/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Very clear
14/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
14/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I understand
14/12/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I understand
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I don't have any queries as of now
14/12/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
14/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 337 9287: I am looking forward to the next steps.
14/12/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
14/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you.
14/12/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 149 9307: On the payment of admission , the period is very short 45 days only considering the situation we are facing in Zimbabwe it's really hard to raise that amount within 45 days.
16/12/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Mickelly. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was not able to connect with you recently as I was a bit occupied. Hence, please do not worry for now. I shall attend to your concerns on Monday. Have a great weekend any my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

18/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Yes ,my Mother was asking about the period of the  payment of the admission fee.
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You have been provided with an extention for 15 days, please. let me know of the particular challenges that you are facing.
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you very much .
18/12/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am afraid that you have been mistaken. I am saying that from the ideal timeframe of 15 days, it has been extended to 45 days form the benefits of Endowment.
18/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Oooh l understand .
19/12/23, 10:32 am - Akshit Edoofa KAM joined using this group's invite link
20/12/23, 10:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Mickelly ,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 10:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

20/12/23, 10:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Good evening ,thank you for sharing this Wonderful news .My family and l will review the letter .We will set a time for the discussion .
20/12/23, 10:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263783379287. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the afternoon at 03:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete MVN University admission formalities.

For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
20/12/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 337 9287: Thank you .
20/12/23, 10:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263783379287
21/12/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mickelly ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 149 9307: That is okay
21/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 149 9307: We can proceed
21/12/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263771499307, Kindly don't worry we will definitely help you with your concern please.
21/12/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600- $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Yes it does
21/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/12/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
21/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Are you saying we are paying $1000 then fees that will be left is $850
21/12/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263771499307. Now, I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $1000.
21/12/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
21/12/23, 4:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
21/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 149 9307: It makes sense but to me as a parent can't afford that much .Since you say it's her first offer letter  when can we expect some other offer letter from different universities so that we can reconsider .Noone will assist me to pay that figure $1850 for the first year ,in addition to that there is visa and a ticket to be paid .Maybe if we can get a university which need at least $350 to $500 to secure a scholarship .
21/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 149 9307: That MVN university can't they reduce their admission fee and we pay the rest in instalments
21/12/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your thoughts @263771499307 and these are absolutely fine. I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Mickelly is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
21/12/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
21/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Yes l understand the whole story ,bt I'm a low income parent but lm sure there are other universities in India which offers reasonable fees annually bt still their registration fee will not be high like $1000.Civil servants in Zimbabwe earn $300 as a salary and step father of Mickely is the only bread winner in a family ,myself I'm not working .Mickelly have got siblings who need fees and so forth to survive.Parents at rural home needs help from us.Maybe if we can save $150 per month up to July that way l can starve .That $1000 can't be payable within 15 days .I don't know if you can negotiate for us to pay in instalments that $1000
21/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with us, I appreciate your honesty. While I understand that you have challenges with the registration fees as you are thinking that the amount of $1000 for the registration fees is high. Is my understanding right?
21/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 149 9307: $1000 to a civil servant in Zimbabwe is very high honestly speaking .
21/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @263771499307, I will definitely try my best to help you here.
21/12/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 3rd, 2024*
21/12/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Yes sir you can go on.
21/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 149 9307: $100 grant for endowment plan ,l know it bt still to me it makes no different because $900 it's still a lot
21/12/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 149 9307: My husband earns $300 ,at least if you say $450 first instalment in Feb and then the other $450 we pay in 2 instalments .You don't know how we struggled to pay enrolment fee .Things are not well in Zimbabwe.
21/12/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand from where you are coming, and being your admission officer I will had a conversation with the university officials to tackle the financial challenges you're facing concerning the upcoming registration fee. Based on our records, the total amount required for your child's admission to the university is $900, with a $100 designated for enrollment, summing up to $1000.
21/12/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In an effort to find a workable solution, I have been exploring the potential of establishing a payment plan. However, before finalizing this plan, it's important that we gain a comprehensive understanding of your current financial situation.
21/12/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence, I wanted to understand the amount you've managed to set aside for your admission fee by the upcoming due date of *January 3rd, 2024*. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
21/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 149 9307: First year annual fee it's a hard nut to crack ,maybe second year will be much better
21/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 149 9307: $200
21/12/23, 5:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263771499307, While considering the current situation, May I kindly know when you will be able to pay the remaining amount?
21/12/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I will manage to pay $250 by 3rd Feb and the other $450 will pay it in 2 instalments March and April
21/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I understand your situation, and will try my best to help you here. However, as you are aware that you have a benefit of $100 due to the Endowment benefits. With the above payment plan you have shared, you will end up completing the registration process by April and by this month the endowment benefits will be over hence, you might end up paying the complete registration fees which is $1000. Are you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out with the suggested payment plan by you.? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Endowment benefits are entitled if l pay the registration fee in 1 month  is it so.What was the purpose of enrolment fee in this case ?
21/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The enrollment fees is for the enrollment in Edoofa Scholarship Program please. Considering that Mickelly is a student under the Edoofa Program, and we have made a promise to help you secure your scholarship seat, we are always here to help you in such situation so that you can secure the scholarship seat. However, given that you have also been granted the Endowment Grant of $100, it might not be possible for you to extend the payment till April. We understand how the endowment benefits come into play and help you out. With that said, l would like to share an alternative with you. May I share the same with you?
21/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 149 9307: You can share
21/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Still endowment of $100 is very little considering the figure to be paid as admission fee .
21/12/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share the two options with you while considering the current situation. The first option is that you can skip the endowment benefits and can make the registration fees in the installment by the month of April.
21/12/23, 6:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The alternative option with the endowment benefit is that you can make the first installment of $200 by the deadline date of 3rd of January. The remaining amount of the registration fees which is $700 can be divided into 3 installment. For better understanding, let me share an example with you please -
21/12/23, 6:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. $250 can be paid by the end of January
2. $200 can be paid by the mid of February
3. $250 can be paid by the end of February
21/12/23, 6:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know what are your thoughts here.
21/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 149 9307: This one can't manage where will l get the money to pay 2 instalments per month .We get 1 salary per month.Let me skip the endowment then l will  I will work with the instalments up to April
21/12/23, 6:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263771499307, I will discuss you concern with the team tomorrow in order to see if there is any other alternative we can help you with.
21/12/23, 6:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope that's okay?
21/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok Sir ,this university is expensive ,l can't afford .Even those instalments up to April l will be starving with the whole family for me to pay all instalments .
21/12/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263771499307 I was going through your application file and find that the cost of education range shared with you was $2000 to $3000. According to the offer letter, we share with you Mickelly's per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
21/12/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know what are your expectations ?
21/12/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I was expecting $1200 per year without scholarship or if it was $1600 without scholar ship it was better.Another option if it was $3000 per annum without scholarship then they offer that 90 percent it was better.MVN it's $5000 something without scholarship so it's demn expensive even if they offer 90 percent it seems there is no scholarship offered .
21/12/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Someone from a loyal can afford that university not low income families
21/12/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Five years it's a long , so try to help me with some institutes which are affordable
21/12/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Let's reconnect tomorrow so that we can have a further discussion about your concerns in order to find a suitable solution.
21/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Other universities without scholarship are paying that $1600 or $1200 so it should be less if they offer scholarship.
22/12/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Good evening sir?
22/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I have find another option after a discussion with my husband .May l pay my first installment end of January that is $450 and another $450 end of February.
22/12/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 149 9307: That will give us enough time to run around unlike 3rd of January no one will give me a loan because it's festive season people will have a lot of plans with their money
22/12/23, 8:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mickelly, I hope you are doing well.
22/12/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing an update with us, I am glad to know that you had a discussion as a family.
22/12/23, 8:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, I was going through our conversation for yesterday and wanted to share some points with you so that we are on the same page.
22/12/23, 8:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you were having doubts about the enrollment fees which you have paid for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I want to share that this fees are for the services we provide to you and Mickelly throughout your journey, including the opportunity to self-fund Mickelly's education with the help of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Additionally, our DSW (Division of Student Welfare) team will be here to guide Mickelly when he arrives in India. 

Along with this, We also promised to get you multiple offer letters from the best universities, and as you know, there is an application cost when applying to universities. However, since you enrolled with Edoofa, we cover the cost for the application process. We also help design the Statement of Purpose, which elevates the chances of higher scholarship. Therefore, the enrollment fees you paid are not part of the cost of education but rather for the services Edoofa offers you and your child throughout your journey of higher education in India.
22/12/23, 8:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that you have financial concerns and feel that the cost of education and registration fees shared with you is quite high. However, when pursuing higher education abroad, the average cost of education for someone pursuing a degree in Law is $6000-$8000, whereas MVN University has provided you with a 90% scholarship, after which your cost of education is only $1600. Compared to the cost of education, this is the best opportunity for Mickelly to pursue a degree in Law.
22/12/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if we are on the same page?
22/12/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: . <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Yes we are on the same page
22/12/23, 8:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are on the same page. As you have shared that you will be able to complete the payment by February, I truly appreciate the efforts you are making towards Mickelly's Registration Process. With this said, I remember that you have raised the amount of $200 for the registration fees which you will be able to pay before 3rd of January. Is my understanding correct?
22/12/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Right now l don't have any cash ,l was hoping  to get a loan of $200 from someone but as l  said during festive season access to loans it's very rare
22/12/23, 8:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your situation and appreciate that you are willing to make the payment, However, I hope you can understand that it's important to complete the registration process by the deadline given by the university. Considering that you have a genuine concern, I would do my best to help you here. 

Although, the University does not allow such extended timelines for fee payments, especially for international scholarships where students worldwide are competing for the same opportunities.
22/12/23, 8:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure being a wise parent, you can understand the importance of adhering these deadline set by the university to secure your scholarship sear. The university has provided a specific deadline of 3rd January could you please let me know the minimum amount you can raise by the due date as you still have around 10 days to raise the amount?
22/12/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I can't promise because  l have got a tight situation .If possible allow us to wait for other responds from different universities because the time frame set it's difficulty for me to raise that amount
22/12/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I completely understand your situation @263771499307, and If you want to wait for other offer letters, you will definitely get more offer letters, although the cost of education for those universities would be quite higher than what has been offered by MVN University. 

Before we started your admission journey, I had a conversation with your counselor on a personal level, and he mentioned that you are highly dedicated for your child to send him abroad to get the quality of higher education which is commendable. Hence, he recommended that we process Mickelly's application for a higher quantum of scholarship which is why we have shared Mickelly's application with MVN University at the first place. I hope you can understand?
22/12/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 149 9307: We can wait because there is nothing l can do to raise money within 10 days yet l don't have any business l am doing .I don't have any source of income except salary which my husband will get month-end and that's when we can get some loan to reach the required amount $450
22/12/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 149 9307: MVN is very expensive we can't say it's cheaper
22/12/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your honesty in sharing the situation with us @263771499307. As you have mentioned that you will be able to get finances by the month-end, With this in mind I would like to know if the following approach works for you - 

1. Make a minimum payment of $100 by January 3rd.
2. Pay the rest of the amount of $350 by the end of January.
3. Make the next installment of $450 by the end of February.
22/12/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 149 9307: That way it's much better .l will try to look for that amount .Are we going to deposit in the university account or we deposit in Mr Jerera's account
22/12/23, 9:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that the above payment plan works for you. Now, Let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
22/12/23, 9:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
22/12/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 149 9307: I'm not in Harare bt it's a peri urban area near Harare
22/12/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
22/12/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
22/12/23, 9:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
22/12/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok ,thank you for sharing .l will make an effort to meet him.
22/12/23, 9:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
22/12/23, 9:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
22/12/23, 9:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
22/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 149 9307: No l will make my payment through Mr Rajan
22/12/23, 9:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263771499307, If you need the details in future please do let me know. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
22/12/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 149 9307: Ok l understand ,you can provide the details
