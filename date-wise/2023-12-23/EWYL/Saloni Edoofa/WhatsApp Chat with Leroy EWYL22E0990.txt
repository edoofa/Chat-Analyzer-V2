02/08/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 248 1233: I am okay ma'am, thank you. Yes we may begin.
02/08/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you remember last from our EWYL Sessions?
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Our sessions before have covered the three EWYL prohects. Also, talked about the Meet and Greet session in Harare on the 28th of May 2023. The session served students and parents at large with providing a chance to know more about the scholarship program. After that you have been sending us some weekly newsletters from Mr. Anghad.
02/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Sorry ma'am, my network is down.
02/08/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I understand it better. Are you aware of all three projects in-depth, like how are they done and can we do to excel in it?
02/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Yes l have understood in depth about the three projects. But l still have not find what l can do to excel in them except for the community building project.
02/08/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will talk about two projects as of now that is community building project and African School Reform Mission project since project 1, that is Corporate Alliances is on hold for some time.
02/08/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For community building, what do you know to excel?
02/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Oooh okay.
02/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Since community building is based on bringing more students into the scholarship program, l have decided to go into my neighboring schools doing some presentations about the whole program. That way I will have access to a lot of students, hence, getting more who will join and as a result my scholarship credits will increase.
02/08/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is well appreciated, I am glad to hear that!

May I know if you remember the group we formed last?
02/08/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
02/08/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Leroy/Saloni /3May2023🎓🇮🇳
02/08/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Yes sure ma'am.
04/08/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

Please excuse me for not reaching out to you yesterday. I was occupied in a meeting that required my immediate attention, I sincerely apologize for that.
May we begin now?
04/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 248 1233: It's alright ma'am. Today I am at church, wanted to communicate earlier but my network was bad.
04/08/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries Leroy, I understand that.

Please take your time!
04/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Thank you ma'am for your understanding.

08/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Leroy, do you want me to restart with the second project is a community building project or do you want me to start with the third project?
08/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 248 1233: You can begin with the third project ma'am.
08/08/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
08/08/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Okay l have heard and understood the voice note. It talks about the last project called The Africa School's Education Reform Mission Project. The goal is to arrange a meeting between the authorities of the school i.e the headmaster or principal with the Edoofa Scholarship Board. Students find it more interesting since they will share how they got into the scholarship program and also their future plans in education with the help of Edoofa.
08/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Leroy. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
08/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Aaah absolutely not ma'am, everything is clear. Also it is because it is our second time discussing about it, so l now have an in depth understanding.
08/08/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I won't be available tomorrow for the session due to some family commitments but I going to connect with you on Thursday positively for the session from 01:30-02:30 PM.
Please make sure that in this time period, you have a look at our weekly newsletter.
In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter💭

In the meantime, enjoy reading the newsletter and keep an eye out for more updates to come📚
08/08/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 248 1233: That is okay ma'am, l understand. I will read the newsletter as asked.
08/08/23, 2:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I can understand that.
08/08/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much Leroy!
10/08/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

May we begin with our sessions🌈
10/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 248 1233: I am fine ma'am, how are you.
Yes we may begin.
10/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
10/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: On Tuesday, I shared this amazing newsletter. May I know what all you grasped from it?
10/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 248 1233: In the Newsletter, Mr. Anghad first talks about teamwork. On this l learnt that it is always necessary to show others that we care. It calls for one to have the feeling of helping others for success requires receiving help from others. This ignites in me those common sayings like no man is an island and no man knows all. He explains that the help does not necessarily subject to a friend but also includes even a stranger. Also it is not like we just have to help with big things but we need to help with any kind of way that we are capable of. This improves the state of the world.

#  3 QUOTES

1. Unveils the significance of reading books, depicting that books makes one powerful (wise).
2. Education paves chances of a bright future for an individual and it is prepared today, thus working hard in education becomes so vital.
3. Teachers are just like bridges who help students cross, it is up to students to be more serious or play. That determines if one will either cross the bridge with the help of teachers or fail to cross the brigde with their help too. It is more like a student chooses to use the help or not.


# 2 QUESTIONS

-Rome wasn't build in a day. It is essential for one ti consider taking small steps ti achieve the great goal.
-These small steps help one develop good habits and build a strong foundation for success.
-Helps one to appreciate himself or herself upon looking at the small successes keeping one motivated to achieve the great goal.
-Consistency and persistence are key, so one should stay focused and never give up always.

# EDOOFA HALL OF FAME

-It encourages youths to step out of their comfort zone, be dedicated and hold arms with the already established leaders and elders in developing the community, for that development does not rest entirely on these elders but also needs the impact of our aspiring minds as today's students.

-Praise Parwanyika our fellow Edoofian has been inspired by the Wednesday lessons from the Edoofa team.

-she became so creative and found resourcefulness in the trash she collected as a wise environmentalist.
-From this l learnt that you need to believe in yourself.
-Not to wait for anyone to motivate you but rather motivate yourself first, be dedicated, consistent and have a never give up attitude. This again, adds up to the two questions that our Edoofa Founder asked, which suggests that he is a great leader and is making a great impact in the lives of Edoofians as evidenced by the inspired Praise Parwaringira.
-Above all the newsletter makes us feel special and have a sense of belonging as Edoofians, on which l am grateful.
10/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is awesome Leroy but may I know are these your won thoughts or you have taken it from the newsletter?
10/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 248 1233: I've been just linking my thoughts to what l have read.
10/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 248 1233: If possible l can show you what l have been noting down as l was reading which came up to all this.
10/08/23, 2:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No no Leroy, I just feel that these thoughts are so beautifully pen down that my eyes are failing to accept. I don't doubt you but rarely do I see such bright student with so much clarity.

14/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It was great, thank you.
14/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?
14/08/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located. <This message was edited>
14/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Q1. Trust Academy. No it is not connected with Edoofa.

Q2. 
- I am Leroy Chizinga. I am currently doing my Upper Six Arts studies at Trust Academy. As a student who has been dreaming of going abroad for my higher education but without enough funds to afford such kind of universities, l had lost hope but this hope got rekindled when l heard of the Edoofa Scholarship Program through a fellow friend from the neighborhood. She said that it focuses on providing affordability and high quality standard of higher education and also provides employability after finishing your program. Hence, l asked for an offline application form and applied. In two weeks time the Edoofa Counseling team reached out to me. Told me about every detail l needed to know, clearing all my doubts about the scholarship program. Afterwards, l went through interviews and passed. That is how l became part of the Edoofa Family.

Following this, l my future aspirations are to become one of the world renowned figure in l.O Psychology, also be an Executive Director at a Social Work Organization and also own my own psychology private organization. Lastly, l want to own an orphanage and a children's home to help the need.

Well, you might be wondering what Edoofa is all about having such a student who have these aspirations which he wants to pursue with the help of it.

Edoofa Scholarship Program provides deserving students with a chance to go for their education in India specifically by providing them with a 75 to 100 percentage scholarship.

In this regard, l would like to ask if you would consider getting on a call with the Edoofa Program Director so that your students can also have the same wonderful chance to go abroad for their higher education.

Q3. Mashonaland East Province
14/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have noted all the details that you have shared!
14/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
14/08/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
14/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Ma'am is it possible for l to give you the number of a school head who is not of my school if l can get it. This is because at my school there is my fellow school mate who is part of the Edoofa too who already went through this process, so he already made contact with the school head. Is it possible to repeat the same procedure with our school head?
14/08/23, 4:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me, no sessions will held tomorrow since our organization will be closed on Tuesday in observance of India's Independence Day🇮🇳
14/08/23, 4:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This significant day marks the birth of a sovereign India, a result of immense sacrifices and unwavering determination. Vibrant parades, flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural performances, and patriotic fervor color the celebrations across the country. It's a time to reflect on India's journey to self-governance and to honor the leaders who led the struggle for freedom.
14/08/23, 4:49 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Oooh it is well ma'am. Please observe the nation's great day. If possible would you show me any pictures of the kind of celebrations which will be held tomorrow for the celebrations? Obviously on the day of our sessions. I am just curious.
16/08/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our sessions🌈

16/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Ma'am our country is having elections on the 23rd of August, so all the schools are being used as polling sessions. As a result, both students and the headmasters will not be available. Will l be able to try after the 23rd?
16/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure that will be fine.

Will it be possible for you to try in the coming days, before 23rd?
16/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Mabvuku High School, Tafara 1 High School I will send other names today too.

So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
17/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

21/08/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to see these three forms, great work done!

Please make sure you stay in touch with the students till they complete their counselling process.
21/08/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to see them!
21/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Noted ma'am.
21/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, Leroy, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
21/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Well noted ma'am.
I will be doing likewise.
21/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin a new journey!
21/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
21/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
21/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
21/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
21/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 248 1233: I am so glad to be beginning a new journey ma'am 🤗
21/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Tuesday and Friday will be okay.
21/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 248 1233: Noted ma'am.
21/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 248 1233: I am so happy ma'am, I have heard of this line where you are supposed to say that "l am a proud EDOOFIAN" everyday and l wondered how and when I would become part of it. Now that l am part it, it feels me with so much gratitude and happiness .
21/08/23, 4:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so honored to hear that as a mentor. You know I always wonder how a student feels about being a part of this community, I just hope you take this tag and make everyone know that you are a proud edoofian.
21/08/23, 4:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this, let me know.
21/08/23, 4:49 pm - +263 71 248 1233: I have done it ma'am.
23/08/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My proud Edoofian, 
«
I hope this message finds you well. As we embark on our journey of learning and personal growth, I'd like to highlight the significance of time management, a crucial life skill that can greatly influence your academic and personal success.

In today's Wednesday lesson, we will be delving into the art of time management. This topic is not only relevant for your studies but will also prove invaluable in your daily life. Effective time management can help you accomplish tasks efficiently, reduce stress, and make the most of your time.

This lesson is not just about theory; it's about practical application. I encourage you to come prepared with questions and examples from your own experiences. By sharing and discussing your challenges and successes, we can all learn from one another.

Remember, effective time management is a skill that can be developed and refined over time, and it can have a profound impact on your academic journey and future endeavors.

See you in class, ready to dive into the world of time management!

Best regards,
Team EWYL

I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others. It's a thought that has been lingering in my mind ever since.

This is Leroy. I am sorry for not been doing our daily morning ritual "l am a proud Edoofian". This is because users of Zimbabwean Netone Networking lines have been facing challenges with using Whatsapp. Most users are being banned from using Whatsapp for no reason and l have been a victim twice. With this being said, l will change lines from Netone to Buddie and l am sure l will not face the same challenges again. l am certain that by Monday l will be using the new line and l will be continuing without our daily morning ritual. Also, this will mean that l will have to be added in all those Edoofian groups. Hope you will understand me ma'am.
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 422 2943: *l will be continuing with our daily morning ritual.

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
22/11/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I am really excited to begin our sessions after your exams. It would be helpful if you could share with me:
*When can we begin with our EWYL Sessions*, _please mention the date_.
22/12/23, 11:06 pm - +263 71 422 2943: Greetings my dear mentor Ms. Saloni. This is Leroy. I want to thank you ma'am fir being always so assistive to me. Being so sympathetic in every step and enlightening me whereever l faced challenges. I bet you are the best mentor amongst all the other Edoofian mentors.All this time l have been with you have shown me that Edoofa Scholarship program is one of the best scholarship programs l have ever met. Above all thank you for letting me know a lot about the Indian culture , a country l fell in love after watching Bollywood movies and Indian series on Zeeworld in 2014. However, it is so sad to announce that l have decided to drop out of the program after doing a lot of considerations and finding out that l do not want to pursue with my higher education at least for now. The time we have spent together as a mentor and student has been so valuable. It taught me a lot of lessons intellectually that are applicable to the real world and for that again l am very grateful.
22/12/23, 11:07 pm - +263 71 422 2943: I want to assure you that l will recommend Edoofa to anyone I'll find being in need of a scholarship. This is mainly because you have raised inumerable leaders some that l know personally.
