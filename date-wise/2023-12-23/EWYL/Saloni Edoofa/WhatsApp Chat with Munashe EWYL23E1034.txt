Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
20/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 307 6096: Of course Ms Saloni ,I can guarantee you that it will be.I am also thrilled to fit in your schedule and to have you as my mentor .I will try my best to make this journey fruitful and bring a  rewarding experience.

20/12/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Munashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
20/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 307 6096: Concerning my long- term goals,after completing my diploma ,I wish to proceed and do a degree in business Administration as my lifetime career.I also intend to be employed in any top class enterprise in order to become a leading entrepreneur in the future with the view to change the business and working environments for the betterment of our communities.

Once I get admitted at the University,my EWYL credits become connected to the University fee account.Thes credits I will earn through the EWYL Program can be adjusted towards my annual University fees.This will reduce my financial burden and offers me greater ease in managing my financial commitments as I progress with my education.I believe this EWYL Program is something that can make my journey flawless until I complete my tertiary education and move towards my goals.
20/12/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your vision and commitment to pursuing a degree in Business Administration and eventually becoming a leading entrepreneur are truly commendable. The strategic connection of your EWYL credits to your university fee account is a brilliant approach, effectively reducing your financial burden and providing smoother financial management throughout your educational journey. It's evident that you've thoughtfully planned your path, and the utilization of the EWYL Program is a smart step toward achieving your long-term goals🫱🏻‍🫲🏼🥺
20/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 307 6096: Thank you for the comment.I also believe that this Program can help me reach far.All thanks to the Edoofa community.
20/12/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Indeed, but I want me and the Edoofa team to be thanked later when you are able to achieve the objectives. 
 Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 307 6096: For the sake of futher understanding I would appreciate it if you make me understand about the two objectives.
20/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, don't worry!
20/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 307 6096: I understand and got to see how Edoofa is changing lives and equiping students according to the morden world on a closer range.
20/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 307 6096: Thank you Ms.Saloni for the  further explanation ,I understand and I can confirm that we are on the same page
20/12/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is so positive and happy for me to listen, I am hoping for so much growth and acceleration in our journey🫶🏻
20/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Persistance, one of my students has _earned around 7,000 USD_ and paid his entire tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
