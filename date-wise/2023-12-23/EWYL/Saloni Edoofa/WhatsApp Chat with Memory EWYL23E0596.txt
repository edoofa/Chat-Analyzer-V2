18/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you Ma'am
18/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.

18/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 820 5526: Good day to you M.S Saloni. I am Farai. I'm Memory's mother.

19/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes please
19/12/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Memory, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
19/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Maam.So to commence with it has always been my biggest dream to become well reputed Lawyer. Growing up I've seen court trials where the victim is oppressed due to failure to have someone who can stand up for them especially the girl child. This has triggered me to have the desire to want to stand up for people's rights and the girl child at large.Through the EWYL Programme I'll be able to fund for myswlf at the same time learning to achieve my goal. Thereby this will reduce the finanicial burden on my parents.
19/12/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your heartfelt aspirations with us. Your dream of becoming a reputable lawyer and advocating for the rights of the oppressed, especially the girl child, is truly inspiring. Your commitment to achieving this dream through the EWYL Programme is commendable, as it not only empowers you but also eases the financial burden on your parents. Your determination to make a positive impact is admirable.
19/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you
19/12/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 401 4355: No Ma'am
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Noted. Thank you
19/12/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Hope you are well.

We will surely discuss the same in today's session
20/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 401 4355: Good morning to you too Ms Saloni.

20/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
20/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Very interesting.

20/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am
20/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you

20/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you so much Ma'am.I've read and clearly understood the newsletter. I've also been greatly inspired by Adam Osborne's qoute which states that "the most valuable thing you can make is a mistake - you can't learn anything from being perfect".This surely is a life time lesson and I'll will greatly apply Mr Angad's wisdom to achieve greater success.I've also noted down the statement that says " the function of Education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character- that is the goal of true education". This indeed is inspiring. Thank you so much💯
20/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am happy to hear your thoughts and I an elated to hear that you liked it as well😌
20/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
20/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 401 4355: True. I really wish to do so. That has becoming my main aim since I started this Programme with you.
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
20/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am thank you for the session.Have a great day
21/12/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Memory,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
21/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Good afternoon Ma'am. Yes we may begin our session please.
21/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Memory?
21/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 401 4355: That's very interesting Ma'am 💯!
21/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Yes Ma'am.
21/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for sharing another document, I apologize for the inconvenience. This is the correct document, please go through this one👆🏼
21/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 401 4355: I've read the document Ma'am.
21/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok
21/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Let me go through it.
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great, Memory!
21/12/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you read the document, do let me know.
21/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 401 4355: I've read the document Ma'am.
21/12/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Memory- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
21/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok.so I've noted that the EWYL Programme serves a purpose of helping students to achieve career goals through teaching them work skills that include 1.awareness 2.acquiring skills 3.being alert to skills that are emerging. The emerging skills include online skills on literacy, social media literacy, creative content writing, data analysis and remote team work. There are also skills that require creativity,  emotional   intelligence and strategic thinking. These include risk taking, empathy, descision making , only to mention a few.  It is stated that the reason for the EWYL  Programme to teach students all the above skills is to prepare them for survival in the future. Also a list of project was outlined for the student to boost corporate alliances and gain communication skills inorder to earn scholarship credit which will therefore pay fr the tuition fee. The activities include finding companies on internet, identifying descision makers who work in the companies,  sharing EDOOFA message with the connections, arranging a meeting or video call with EDOOFA and signing the contract,  only a few listed. It is stated that for every student enrolled in the EDOOFA scholarship programme and pays the first part of the enrollment fee $20 worth scholarship of credits  is earned by the one undertaking the project, $30 for completion of Admission Formalities of the university and an additional opportunity of earning $5 worth of scholarship credits per student that EDOOFA team connects with you for clarity on the programme. That is all I understood.
22/12/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening Memory, 
Hope all are good!

With three days to go for Christmas, and celebrations all around us, my mind is filled with happiness for everyone and I wish that you all get what you wish for🥺🎁
With this spirit, I hope we can begin our session..
22/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Good day to you too Ms Saloni.Thank you very much. I really wish the same for you too and yes we may begin our session please.
22/12/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much Memory!
22/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 401 4355: You are welcome .
22/12/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have answered it really well, it reflects clarity of thoughts and in-depth understanding of the concept🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
22/12/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/12/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Thank you
22/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok
22/12/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you listen to the audio, do let me know
22/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 401 4355: I'm done
22/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 401 4355: I've  listened to the audio Ma'am.
22/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Is there any room for questions?
22/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, yes, but after I have explained it completely, you can ask as many questions as you want.
22/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok Ma'am thank you
22/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Ok. I have learnt that the objective of the first project which is the corporate Alliance is to gain an understanding of the market I plan to enter in the future and gain experience at this stage. This is beneficial as it is a way to avoid professional blunders in the future. I've also learnt that it is easier to connect with companies online using the Linkedln account which is a professional connecting platform. This allows to connect with companies and employees as well as connect with Managers.
22/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Memory. I’m happy with your understanding.
22/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Noted Ma'am
22/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you read the document, do let me know.
22/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 401 4355: Done.
22/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
22/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 401 4355: So according to my understanding, a few factors are considered to make sure that one looks for the right type of company. These factor include a) The nature of the company which must be either student-centric, recreational or content-centric platform. Examples listed include Obami, Aficazilla, Palmpay, only to mention a few b) Scale of the company which should neither be too be nor too small c) Financial stability. The company must be financially stable and sound d) Background of founder. The founder must have a strong background in terms of qualifications and experience. I've  also understood that platforms like Linkedln and google can be used to connect to these companies as well as social media platforms like facebook and instagram. A few steps have been outlined in the process to look for the right companies. These include 1) Searching which is by connecting with founders and start-ups on linkedln and on google 2) studying the nature of the company, its functions, purposes and expertise 3) Studying the website of the company to check if it is working properly 4) Checking the various social media platforms of the company to get an idea of the activities and functioning status of the company 5) To understand the background of the founder and other core members 6) Reaching out the company members and dropping connections requests. That is all I understood. Thank you
22/12/23, 2:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, on a very emotional, happy, and jolly note, I want to end our session for today because it's time to roll up for our Christmas celebrations🎄. From tomorrow until Monday, our entire team will also be immersed in the festivities, celebrating this time with our families. We will resume our sessions from Tuesday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM🕜.

I, your proud mentor, Ms. Saloni, want to wish you a Merry Christmas🎁. It would have been amazing if I were there with you in person, but I sincerely wish you all the happiness, love, joy, and cozy family time, and, yes, may all your wishes come true, just like mine did by having you as my wonderful student🥺♥️
