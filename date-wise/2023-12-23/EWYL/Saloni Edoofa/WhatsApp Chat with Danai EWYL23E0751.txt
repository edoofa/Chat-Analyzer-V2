Sorry for the delay
08/12/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
08/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Thank you
I'm happy to be working with you too
08/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Even I am excited and I am thrilled to assist you🫶🏻 <This message was edited>
08/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 154 2433: @27629069831 that's my father. 
He's not online at the moment but he'll connect with you later

12/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Good morning
Thank you
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes we can
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Good afternoon
12/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Danai, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I want to be an independent someone in future through studying optometry with all my effort. And at the same time as I'll be studying I'll also be earning money and this will ease the expenses my parents would have to go through as I'll be helping them
12/12/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, I am so thrilled and excited to know you👏🏼
I want to assure you that I am there in this journey with you always!
12/12/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Thank you Ms Saloni
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 154 2433: No
What are they?
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I understand
12/12/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Thank you
I'm also glad to bw working with women
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I've watched the video
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Nice to know you
13/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Good afternoon  Edoofa
13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Danai,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
13/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes we can
13/12/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, what did you learn about me from the video?
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 154 2433: You said you love working with young minds.
Also ofcourse you said you are into painting and dancing
13/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 154 2433: You also mentioned that if one is dedicated and focused one can achieve the goals he or she wants
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much and yes, my agenda is to transform the lives of all my students and especially bright minded like you🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
13/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Indeed
13/12/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
13/12/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Okay
13/12/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you read it, do let me know.
13/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I've read the newsletter
13/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
13/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes each section was interesting but i very much liked *Quotes for you* <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, I am glad that you liked it!
13/12/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Danai?
13/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Sounds great and interesting
Thank you for these goals which  will mostly benefit me
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, Danai!
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
13/12/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
13/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I've seen that the document is a bit long so can i get back to you tomorrow
13/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Okay sure
14/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Good afternoon
14/12/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Danai,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
14/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Did you go through the document?
14/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes i did
14/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Danai- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
14/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I might not be able to share all but just a few

It was indicated that for the EWYL program content writers are on demand
Also money will be advanced to your bank account if you find some students to also work with EDOOFA
14/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Also our economy got afffected a lot by COVID-19 resulting in job losses hence EDOOFA is there to prepare students for future jobs
14/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, absolutely loved it!
14/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Thank you ma'am
14/12/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Okay sure
14/12/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you listen to it, do let me know.
14/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I've listened to the audio
14/12/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
14/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 154 2433: You will help in creating an account
We'll explain how EDOOFA prepared me for future employability after graduation 
Now waiting for the document with questions you said you'd send
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled about our upcoming session starting on Monday since I will be unavailable tomorrow due to a prior meeting also no sessions are held on Saturday and Sunday. During the next three days, I have an exciting and creative task for you🎭, and you can choose from three options:
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Option A*: Design a captivating poster that visually represents your current position in terms of your goals and illustrates where you aspire to be with the support of Edoofa📈

OR

*Option B*: If you've been involved in any community-building projects, create a poster highlighting your experiences and discussing Edoofa's role in these initiatives🎯🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

OR

*Option C*: Produce a video detailing your journey so far, starting from the counseling phase, progressing through the admission process, and concluding with your encounters with me as part of the EWYL Department📽️

I am eager to see your response and the creative output from your chosen option. Looking forward to our session on Monday.
18/12/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go? 

This is a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *01:30-02:30* PM this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
19/12/23, 7:34 am - +263 78 154 2433: Good morning Ms Saloni. I was unable to connect with you yesterday but today definitely i will
19/12/23, 10:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Danai,
How are you?
19/12/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: Could you inform me of any amendments in advance? I have a dedicated time slot for our sessions, and waiting without notice was a bit demotivating. It's disheartening when only one party seems to be fully committed and conscious of the schedule.
19/12/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
19/12/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @263781542433 @27629069831
19/12/23, 1:55 pm - +27 62 906 9831: Sorry I have assigned Danai to take control of everything. I would like to give her a chance of taking the bull by its horns. Unfortunately it looks like where she is based at the moment, there is a challenge of network. We believe in our ancestors so there is some kind of rituals taking place there. As for myself I have encouraged extreme loadshedding schedules to the extent that I am unable to use my fon. 

Kindly accept our apologies as a family for any inconvenience caused thereof
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for the update. I completely understand, I appreciate your efforts and respect the decision to assign Danai as the lead. Wishing her success in navigating the challenges. No need to apologize—family and personal commitments are always a priority. We'll work through it together.
19/12/23, 2:03 pm - +27 62 906 9831: Personally I prioritize education. Unfortunately I am very far away from her to emphasize the need to follow these assignments religiously. I cam only reinforce through this media. I pray that they will give her a chance to note of her new endeavors with vigour
19/12/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your perspective. I completely understand the importance of education and the challenges of distance. I'll do my best to reinforce the value of assignments through our communication. I appreciate your prayers and hope she embraces her new endeavors with enthusiasm.
20/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 154 2433: Good afternoon Ms Saloni
20/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 154 2433: Right now I am in the rural areas for the Christmas holiday and is possible may we please resume our sessions after a week. There's nk electricity here and i thought I'd be able to be connecting with you unfortunately I can't
20/12/23, 1:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Danai,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
20/12/23, 1:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Oh, that is alright, may I know when will you be able to join for your EWYL Program?
20/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 154 2433: By the 26th
20/12/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I understand that.
20/12/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: But right now, you have a stable network I believe. So, will it be possible for you to carry forward the sessions?
20/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Thank you
20/12/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share about this?
21/12/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Danai,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
22/12/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Danai, 
Hope all are good!

With three days to go for Christmas, and celebrations all around us, my mind is filled with happiness for everyone and I wish that you all get what you wish for🥺🎁
With this spirit, I hope we can begin our session.. <This message was edited>
22/12/23, 2:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, on a very emotional, happy, and jolly note, I want to end our session for today because it's time to roll up for our Christmas celebrations🎄. From tomorrow until Monday, our entire team will also be immersed in the festivities, celebrating this time with our families. We will resume our sessions from Tuesday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM🕜.

I, your proud mentor, Ms. Saloni, want to wish you a Merry Christmas🎁. It would have been amazing if I were there with you in person, but I sincerely wish you all the happiness, love, joy, and cozy family time, and, yes, may all your wishes come true, just like mine did by having you as my wonderful student🥺♥️

Happy holidays! I am sure you are going to make the most of this time. 

And, wait, don't forget to share pictures of your celebration with me. 📸
