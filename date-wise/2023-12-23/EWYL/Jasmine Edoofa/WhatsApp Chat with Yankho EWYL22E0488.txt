I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

The project will encourage me to adopt a mindset of identifying an openly sharing opportunity to make positive impacts to others. 

-To successfully complete the project, i will need African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools or those that are in their final year of secondary school. 
I will utilize my network to refer the students to the program,and credits will be rewarded for this

To spread my link I can join their what's app groups and put my link there. 
After the Students have joined my group I can start sharing the information about Edoofa 
I will also have to add you in my group as my mentor
08/09/23, 9:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Yankho, I am impressed with your understanding.
08/09/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
08/09/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

08/09/23, 10:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/09/23, 10:54 am - +265 994 92 52 10: 1.The name of my school is Chaminade Marianist Secondary School. I think the School is Connected to Edoofa because is first heard about Edoofa from my Principal. 

2.How are you sir/Madam, my name is Yankho and I would like to introduce you to Edoofa. A program From India that offers Scholarship opportunities to African Students at an affordable price.This program is accessible and affordable.The other interested part of this program is that students receive credits after given some activities to do. The credits are important since they help  to reduces the expenses.  I would also like you to tell your students about this program so that them too can find this opportunity just like me. If you are interested you can give me you contact details so that the Edoofa program Director can arrange a call with you for more clarifications. 

3.My school is located in Lilongwe
08/09/23, 10:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, You school is connected and It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/09/23, 10:58 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Yes I agree
08/09/23, 10:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
14/09/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Yankho, 
How are you doing? It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate it if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions? Please feel free to discuss them with me.
14/09/23, 8:54 am - +265 994 92 52 10: There is nothing much stopping me, it is just that I was also waiting for you, so thought that you were busy or that maybe there were no sessions for the past 2 days
14/09/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No Yankho, So every time whenever you are present for the session, you have to come and address that in the group by greeting.
14/09/23, 8:59 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Alright  I will be doing so
14/09/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So last time we were discussing Project 3. Do you remember?
14/09/23, 9:02 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Yes I remember
14/09/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Let us continue
14/09/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
14/09/23, 9:07 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Alright
14/09/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
14/09/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
14/09/23, 9:10 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Oh ok
14/09/23, 9:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Yankho- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
14/09/23, 9:17 am - +265 994 92 52 10: For now it is oky, only that here most students and parent are finding it difficult to believe in this program
14/09/23, 9:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I can understand and we can't blame them for that. I will train you in such a way that you will be able to educate them properly and I will hare some videos and photos with you which will help you in smooth execution of projects.
14/09/23, 9:20 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Alright
14/09/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So Yankho, There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me

1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username

14/09/23, 9:59 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Oky I will do so
14/09/23, 10:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
14/09/23, 10:11 am - +265 994 92 52 10: Alright I will be doing so
14/09/23, 10:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now I will get back to you on the Line in some time.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Tuesday i.e 14 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am*
09/11/23, 10:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
