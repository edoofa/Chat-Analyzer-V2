12/08/23, 12:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

I will see you on Wednesday.
14/08/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 234 0154: Okay ma'am.
16/08/23, 10:14 am - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.

16/08/23, 10:16 am - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!

semester, will it carry overto the next year?
FAQ
In relation to your question regarding the carryover of the Edoofa Grant from
one semester to the next year, it is important to note that as per the policies set
by the Academic Board of Edoofa, the grant credits will not be carried forward.
If an individual is unable to redeem the Edoofa Grant in a specific semester, the
unused credits will not be transferred or carried over to the subsequent year.
Therefore, it is crucial to utilize the grant credits within the designated time
frame and adhere to the requirements and guidelines stipulated by the
Academic Board.
16/08/23, 11:43 am - +91 78273 08969: Do you mean this?

16/08/23, 2:16 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, So tell me what did you not understand in that?
16/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 234 0154: The question remain unanswered for me. For instance one's accommodation is being paid by the university while staying on compus will the grant be able to provide for something else.
17/08/23, 8:43 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
To answer your questions, Yes. The grant can be adjusted to your accommodation only if your tuition fees are paid and you live on campus.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Jasmine your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Jasmine's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? :.  I have learnt that Edoofa program is a link between African children to better education in India. It is partially funded(school fees) and relatively affordable to some. Edoofa program is focuses on the betterment of African lives by providing African children with unlimited exposure to the world that is not confined to Africa. The program wants to uplift Africans using their children and to attain that objective,they saw it fit to provide partial funding for the students so that tertiary education will not be too expensive and relatively cheaper thereby  increasing it's available and accessibility to most Africans. Hence the EWYL program was put into practice,this will be of assistance to some of the students to earn money whilst learning which may be used to pay the remaining school fees and other expenses. It also leads to accessibility of scholarship credits hence one can pay the equivalent amount to that being paid in cash by another individual. All in all, Edoofa program helps to reducing the financial burden of parents when paying for tertiary education for their children.

This lesson aims to provide valuable insights and inspiration as we explore the stories of individuals, businesses, and nations that have thrived by fostering a competitive edge.

Come prepared to engage in thoughtful discussions, share your perspectives, and gain a deeper understanding of how the power of competitive spirit can shape our paths to success in our upcoming session.

Best regards,

23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently.

23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,

23/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 

The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 70272 86265: I understand
23/11/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.

23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving further, By the end of December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits than the same.

Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
23/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 70272 86265: Okay ma'am

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Spirit of competition is to focus on attention and create individual ownership of the big picture goals if the whole team. It also lead people to do their personal best being the driver for success, but it can also lead to toxic ego driven mentality which undermines and destroys team objective.

Competition drives our individual growth . At one point in life I had the spirit of competition  because I  didn't like being second in my class ,so that gave me the courage of working hard and face challenges.  Although at times I competed under pressure  it builds me and make me the person I am today.

The Power of Analysis: Unleashing Your Potential Through Input-Output

 I have understood that in this world of academia , students have so many things that demand attention and time . These things include projects, task and assignments. It is important to unlock one's potential and developing a deeper understanding of the world around you. One must analyze the task he or she is given carefully writing down. If one is able to identify the inputs and implement them well the output will be great. 

I understood that inputs are the building blocks of any task. Information, data , one's skills and knowledge are inputs. I also understood that we must make a plan with the inputs that you have identified. Be creative and use methods that are effective to get a desired output. The other thing I learnt is to take time to evaluate whether the output align with the initial task requirements. One must learn from their mistakes and correct it the next time they do something.

04/12/23, 5:35 pm - +91 70272 86265: *Saturday activity*

Eversince the day I started doing EWYL I learnt many things. The things include communicate skills , soft skills , time management  and many more. I faced many challenges in the process like not finding students to share about the program during the community building program and school too.  

  I have learnt from my mistakes  and I have been working hard. I have   improved in communication  and I'm starting to work on my goals for future projects, setting goals for personal and academic development.

The main thing I learnt is to share information which is true and be frank all the time.   The main objective is to make a plan and then implement them.
The project offers many opportunities like the chance to self finance ourselves and make students employable ready.
 I would like to connect with local organizations,  and influencial people so that I can gain knowledge from them.

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

The virtue of honesty is centrally a character trait concerned with reliable not intentionally distorting the facts unless it is morally appropriate to do so.  I learnt that honesty is the cornerstone of integrity. It helps a person academically. The reward of maintaining honesty extend beyond avoiding penalties.

I learned that Edoofa  program is a partial scholarship that helps many students who couldn't afford to fulfill thay dreams .Being part of Edoofa also teaches people to value hardwork , skill development and never gibing up. Also that the EWYL program has been of great help to many students as they can self finance themselves.

I am a hardworking , intelligent and  a fast thinker . I make sure that in everything I do I put all my focus and excel in it .
I believe that the edoofa scholarship is targeting all the intelligent students so that they can excel and I do believe I'm one of those students.
