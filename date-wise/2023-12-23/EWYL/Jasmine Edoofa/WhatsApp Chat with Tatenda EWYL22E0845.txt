25/08/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Hello
29/08/23, 10:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Tatenda, 
I would like to schedule a session with you on Monday i.e. *04-09-2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
29/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Hello ma'am how's it
31/08/23, 1:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tatenda. 
Kindly answer to the question.
31/08/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok l will make it up to you Ma'am
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
17/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 852 8592: Option 1
17/09/23, 11:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning ,

06/10/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
06/10/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

06/10/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Yes but you can clarify it
06/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 852 8592: You can just brief me about it
06/10/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>

I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
16/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 372 9647: Thank madan. I will inform you when ready, especially in the afternoon
16/10/23, 8:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, May I know that are you available for the session now?

I hope you are in good health. *IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*
May I know are you available?
21/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Hello ma'am
21/10/23, 9:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you?
21/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 71 852 8592: I'm good how are you?

21/10/23, 9:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Can you please go through the past conversation so that we can continue
21/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 852 8592: You welcome
21/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok Ma'am we can continue
21/10/23, 9:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be
21/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok I'm following
21/10/23, 9:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 

Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
21/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok Thank you so much nice to meet her
21/10/23, 9:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
21/10/23, 9:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
21/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok Ma'am
21/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok Ma'am
21/10/23, 9:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Tatenda to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
21/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok lm getting it right
21/10/23, 9:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Tatenda forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
21/10/23, 9:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/10/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
23/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 852 8592: Ok Ma'am it's ok drop it
23/10/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

07/11/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
07/11/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know that have you texted me on the Line?
07/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 852 8592: No t yet
08/11/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* @263718528592 
I hope you are in great spirits. I would like to remind you that today we have our session scheduled from *8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m*

Also, I can see that yesterday we weren't able to complete the session on time. It is really important that we value each other's time and take the maximum within these 60 minutes. I hope we are on the same page. 

Now let us start today's session. *Are you ready?*
08/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 852 8592: Morning Ma'am

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Tuesday i.e 14 November 2023 from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm*
09/11/23, 10:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.

Now, *I would like to remind you that we have our session scheduled for today from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm*
Ensure you are on time so we can utilize each minute of the session wisely.
