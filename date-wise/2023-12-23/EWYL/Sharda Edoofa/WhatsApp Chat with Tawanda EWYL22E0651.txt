It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

*After having a keen observation, I would like to re-iterate a few important pointers that will help us in having a smooth session.*
Recently, there have been some irregularities in your attendance for our sessions on the EWYL Line from your end.
Consistent attendance from you contributes significantly to a dynamic and fruitful learning environment for all.

*Action Plan for an Outstanding Session:*

*Session Schedule:* Our sessions take place twice a week on *Tuesday and Friday, from 9:30 am to 11:00 am.*
*Wednesday Lesson:* Every Wednesday, a valuable lesson will be shared on the EWYL Line. Kindly write Wednesday  Lesson on the line before 9:30 am.
*Saturday Activity:* On Saturdays, an engaging activity will be posted on the EWYL Line. Please write Saturday Activity before 9:30 am.
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Session Focus:* During our sessions, we discuss project updates, delve into the Wednesday Lesson, and share responses to the Saturday activity. Ensure sharing your understanding and responses before we start our sessions.
*Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits.
*Discouraging Reminders:* Instead of relying on constant reminders, let's cultivate the habit of being mindful of our class timings and being available for our scheduled sessions. It speaks volumes about your commitment.
*Daily Affirmation:* Don't forget to maintain the ritual of declaring *'I am a proud Edoofian'* daily on the EWYL Line.
19/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now share your confirmation that you will adhere to the above-mentioned guidelines and will not be unavailable, late or partially active in our sessions anymore. Your response is awaited.
22/12/23, 10:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Twanda
