12/09/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 033 1526: Good morning
16/09/23, 1:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Madalitso
I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to message on the EWYL Line so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?
16/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 033 1526: l go to work
16/09/23, 4:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Madalitso
Can you atleast come for half an hour-long session either on Wednesday or Saturday?

It is important we stay connected and keep working towards earning as many scholar credits as we can. A lot of my students have already earned more that $8OO scholarship credits. I have seen your sincerity and responsibility towards your sessions earlier.
Hence, I would also want you to do the same.
09/11/23, 10:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Madalitso
It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
19/12/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
*After having a keen observation, I would like to re-iterate a few important pointers that will help us in having a smooth session.*
Recently, there have been some irregularities in your attendance for our sessions on the EWYL Line from your end.
Consistent attendance from you contributes significantly to a dynamic and fruitful learning environment for all.

*Action Plan for an Outstanding Session:*

*Session Schedule:* Our sessions take place twice a week on *Tuesday and Friday, from 9:30 am to 11:00 am.*
*Wednesday Lesson:* Every Wednesday, a valuable lesson will be shared on the EWYL Line. Kindly write Wednesday  Lesson on the line before 9:30 am.
*Saturday Activity:* On Saturdays, an engaging activity will be posted on the EWYL Line. Please write Saturday Activity before 9:30 am.
19/12/23, 1:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Session Focus:* During our sessions, we discuss project updates, delve into the Wednesday Lesson, and share responses to the Saturday activity. Ensure sharing your understanding and responses before we start our sessions.
*Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits.
*Discouraging Reminders:* Instead of relying on constant reminders, let's cultivate the habit of being mindful of our class timings and being available for our scheduled sessions. It speaks volumes about your commitment.
*Daily Affirmation:* Don't forget to maintain the ritual of declaring *'I am a proud Edoofian'* daily on the EWYL Line.
19/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now share your confirmation that you will adhere to the above-mentioned guidelines and will not be unavailable, late or partially active in our sessions anymore. Your response is awaited.
22/12/23, 10:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Madalitso
I hope you are doing well
Our session has been *rescheduled to 1:30pm today.* I have to attend an important meeting right now.Kindly come to the EWYL Line and share your understanding of the Wednesday Lesson beforehand. 

We will reconvene at 1:30pm. Kindly be available.
