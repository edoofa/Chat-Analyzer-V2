Hope that you are doing well.

I would really appreciate it if you would come to the EWYL Line and follow your daily ritual so that we can commence with your EWYL journey.

I hope that you are well.

Please excuse me for being unable to take your session today as I went to the airport to receive our Proud Edoofians. I am indeed overjoyed to have the privilege of mentoring such exceptional students. Witnessing their joyful and enthusiastic expressions after their lengthy journey was a truly heartwarming experience.❤️

So let's schedule your missed session so that you don't lose any opportunity to learn and earn on Wednesday from 12:00 to 1:00 PM.

Hope that you are well.

I was expecting a response from your side but no worries, as I am really looking forward to helping you on this EWYL journey and starting this amazing new chapter with you, I hope that we are on the same page in this regard as I want to make your EWYL Journey fruitful.
Hoping for a quick and positive response.

Hope you are well.

I've noticed that we haven't been in touch for a while, and you've been inactive in our conversations. I wanted to check in and see if you're facing any challenges or if there's anything you'd like to discuss. Your feedback and response are important to me. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Hope you are well.

I apologize for not being able to take your session due to a prior commitment to address a personal matter.
Thank you for understanding.

I hope you are doing well.

As you're aware, our scheduled session for Monday didn't take place. Therefore, I'd like to arrange a missed session for today from 12:00 to 1:00 PM.
📍 *Attendance is mandatory* and *be there on time.*

Hope you are well.

Tinashe, follow the Proud Edoofian ritual on the EWYL Line and come for your sessions, I hope that I don't have to remind you this every time.

Hope you are well.

It's been a while since we last connected. Your insights and contributions are valuable. I'd love to hear from you again and see how you're doing. Please share your thoughts, experiences, or any updates you'd like to share. Let's keep the conversation going!
21/12/23, 3:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263717735548 @263783089889 

I hope this message finds you well. I have noticed your continued *lack of attendance in our sessions and no response to my previous messages is a matter of concern* I hope that you know that you are missing out on a lot of opportunities due to your absence. It is imperative that you promptly address this communication gap. Please reply without delay or provide a valid reason for your unresponsiveness.
📍Your immediate attention to this matter is expected.
