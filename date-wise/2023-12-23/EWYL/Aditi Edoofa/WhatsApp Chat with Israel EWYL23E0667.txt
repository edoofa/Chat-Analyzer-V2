I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.
29/09/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 494 6012: I'm so marvelled to know you ma'am
29/09/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

03/10/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Israel, I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
03/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 494 6012: Good morning Ms Aditi. I would like to apologize for the inconveniences caused. Sorry I didn't not inform you that I was going to attend a lesson at school  at 8am this morning
03/10/23, 11:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Israel, so may I please know your schools's schedule I want to make sure that you don't miss out on any opportunity.
03/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 494 6012: We attended lessons from Monday to Friday  at 8am upto 5pm <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 1:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, Israel.
03/10/23, 1:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 1:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose a slot.
*Monday to Friday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday to Friday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
03/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Saturday will be ok. I'll be available

20/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright!
20/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes ma'am
20/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Good afternoon Ms Aditi
20/10/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am waiting for a response on this.
20/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 494 6012: No ma'am would you please explain further
20/10/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
20/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 570 1107: No can you explain further
20/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have explained it. Please go through it.
20/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Wow this is nice. So I as a student what is it that I have to do inorder to get payed
20/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That would be discussed in our further discussions.
20/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 494 6012: It's a pleasure to know you Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/10/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. There were some crucial discussions we couldn't cover; I encourage your active participation and respond timely because I believe you understand the significance of the EWYL session.
20/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Totally! That's awesome.
20/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 494 6012: I understand. Thank you ma'am.

28/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 502 6369: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:29 pm - +91 74284 45625: Greetings! I'm Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, EWYL, and I hope this message finds you and your parents in good health.

I'm reaching out to let you know that your mentor, Ms. Aditi is experiencing some technical issues with her device. We are working to resolve this as soon as possible. In the meantime, to ensure you don't miss any important updates, Ms. Aditi will be using my device to convey the necessary information. 

Thank you for your understanding.
01/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Noted thank you for communicating
01/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 74284 45625: Hye Israel, Ms. Aditi this side.
I hope you are ready for your session.
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes i am ready
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 570 1107: How are you Maam
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 74284 45625: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 74284 45625: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

01/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 74284 45625: - Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
01/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes that wld be great. I also think it will be great if Israel answers these questions. I am his sister
01/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 570 1107: He has gone for a discussion preparing for tomorrow’s exam
01/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 74284 45625: Okay, I understand! @263775701107
01/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 74284 45625: Thank you for informing me.

Please note that there won't be a session tomorrow because I'll be visiting one of our partner universities for the orientation program.

06/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes maam
07/11/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So are you ready to begin today's session?⚡
07/11/23, 4:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm quite let down that you didn't attend our planned session today, and there wasn't any advance notice
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Good evening ma'am. Apologies, I went for a discussion without notifying you. But in our next session I won't miss out.

Hope you are well.
08/11/23, 8:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Israel you must take care of this from next time.
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I hope you are ready for the session!💯
08/11/23, 4:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm expressing profound disappointment over your absence from our planned session today
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 494 6012: I apologize for missing your lesson again without notifying you in advance. We were called at school at 10am. I'm sorry ma'am and I take full responsibility for my mistake.

I am very sorry for wasting your time and disrupting your session plan. I know how much effort you put into preparing and delivering your lessons, and I appreciate your dedication and expertise. You are a great mentor and I learn so much from you.

The reason I missed your lesson was that I was needed at school to complile my computer sciences project that required my immediate attention. I was so overwhelmed and distracted that I forgot to inform you. This was very unprofessional and disrespectful of me, and I deeply regret it.

To make up for the missed session, I would like to ask you if we can reschedule it to Saturday again . I am also willing to do any extra work that you may assign me to catch up on the material. I promise that this will not happen again and that I will always notify you in advance if I have any issues that may affect our lessons.

Please accept my sincere apology and let me know how I can make this right. I value your mentorship and I hope to continue working with you and learning from you.
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well,
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, Israel.
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope you are excited for today's session💯
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity. You must learn about Diwali, light a candle on the occasion, and send me a photo of yourself celebrating it; I can't wait to see it!🤩
09/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 494 6012: 😂😂 how is it done.
14/11/23, 8:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Israel!
Hope you are well.
14/11/23, 8:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Israel, so I expect you to go through some articles regarding Diwali!
14/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 494 6012: Good morning ma'am. Yah I did some research and in summary I found out that Diwali is a Hindus festival of lights where we celebrate spiritual victory of light over darkness and good over evil. Just to mention a few, Diwali is a five day long festival and people refrain from eating meat. During Diwali, people typically wear their finest clothes, decorate their homes with earthen lamps and rangoli (decorative patterns made of colored rice flour), and worship Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. There are also fireworks and family feasts, where sweets and gifts are shared.
14/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 494 6012: That's what I learnt maybe you can add or correct where I went wrong
14/11/23, 12:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your research succinctly captures the essence of Diwali as a Hindu festival of lights, symbolizing the spiritual triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. Lasting five days, it involves abstaining from meat, wearing festive attire, decorating homes with lamps and rangoli, and worshiping Lakshmi for prosperity. Diwali is marked by fireworks, family feasts, and the sharing of sweets and gifts. 😊🕯️🎉
14/11/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for the session?🤩
14/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 502 6369: Let's do in the next 1 hr 15mins

14/11/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263774946012 I would appreciate it if you would adhere to the time allotted to you.
14/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ok ma'am

27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Israel, may I know what you have retained till now regarding EWYL Projects, so that we can resume from there.
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay .....we haven't talk much ...we last talked about the two main objectives of the EWYL
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Interesting!!
27/11/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
27/11/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

27/11/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Sounds great ma'am
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?

(August 2024 or August 2025)
13/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay ma'am .....on it!!
13/12/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
13/12/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
13/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ISRAEL/ADITI*
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
13/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

13/12/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
13/12/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

16/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Am good as for now ma'am !
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Yes 😋!
18/12/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.

18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Thank you
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
18/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Tuesday and Friday
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay
18/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00- 1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Israel., that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
18/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay
