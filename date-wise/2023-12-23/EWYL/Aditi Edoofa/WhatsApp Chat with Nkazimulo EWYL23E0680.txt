19/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 263 6730: I think Nkazimulo is having network challenge , she's currently not rechargeable

Secondly,the program can give me access to mentors and advisors who can help me navigate the process of being an entrepreneur
To add on, the program can connect me with other-like minded individuals who are also pursing their goals

20/12/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning☀️
Wishing you a day filled with positivity, productivity, and moments that bring a smile to your face. 

So let's begin our today's session🚀
20/12/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay
20/12/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/12/23, 8:34 am - +263 71 386 8072: No...can you explain further
20/12/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/12/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 71 386 8072: Thanks fir the explanation...now l understand
20/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 386 8072: *for
20/12/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 386 8072: Nice.... thanks for the introductions
20/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 386 8072: Yes
20/12/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
20/12/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263713868072  Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
20/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay let me read them
20/12/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
20/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 386 8072: Mr Angad has motivating and inspirational quotes that make you eager to make a change in your life and never to give up in life.l also like the fact that he states that one should spend their days wisely 💯and do something productive in life
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, those quotes are really motivating.
20/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 386 8072: I did notice the hall of inspiration.....yes it is indeed a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself... especially for the good deeds you have done.....l just hope that one day it's going to be me mentioned in the Edoofa Hall of inspiration 😌
20/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 386 8072: A lot
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
20/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 386 8072: Well these are great ideas...well l don't have any complaint to them😌
20/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
20/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
20/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
20/12/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up this fantastic session for today—keep soaring higher! 🚀Embrace every step, and let your achievements be a testament to your dedication and growth. 💯
20/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 386 8072: There is Ms Sanjana who is the Head of the department and there is also Ms Davis who is the Head coach.l understood that both of them are there to help me achieve the desired skillet through the EWYL course and evaluate all the efforts that l make
20/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 386 8072: 2.
1.Make sure that my academic journey is great
2.Ensure that l am given enough opportunities to self finance my education in India
3. Work towards attaining the objective that is relavant to  the 21st century skills
20/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 386 8072: 3.A
20/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 386 8072: I'd describe the "hall of inspiration" as a metaphorical place where people can go to feel motivated and excited about life. It's a place where people can learn from others, find their own inspiration, and discover their own passions. It's a place that helps people find their purpose and gives them the courage to pursue their dreams. It's a place that makes people feel hopeful, creative, and full of energy.
20/12/23, 9:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is Awesome, we will connect on it tomorrow.🚀
20/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 386 8072: Thank you ....have a good day
21/12/23, 8:36 am - +263 71 386 8072: Morning

May your day be brimming with positive vibes, productivity, and moments that bring a smile to your face. Now, let's start our session today with energy and excitement! 🚀
21/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay
21/12/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
21/12/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 386 8072: I just read the document that you sent and l realized that most of the things require one to have knowledge on ICT tools and so on which is not a big deal....but l do have a question on the projects .....l noticed that each project has activities so do l carry out the whole project or l will be doing per activity
21/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
21/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay thank for the explanation......so when am l supposed to start these projects
21/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, you will start but first please summarize your understanding of the audio, so that I can make sure that we are on the same page
21/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 386 8072: The "Corporate Alliance" project requires students to research companies in their area that are technology-driven and digitally focused. This will give them a better understanding of the current job market and the skills that are in demand.
They will also create LinkedIn profiles to connect with professionals and learn more about different industries. In doing so, they will be able to identify any gaps in their skills and work on developing those skills through the program.
21/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 386 8072: This will also help students to prepare for their future careers
21/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
21/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
21/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.🫶🏻
21/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 386 8072: The document outlines four steps for identifying a company to work with. The first step is to identify your interests and passions. The second step is to research companies that align with your interests and passions. The third step is to contact companies that you're interested in and see if they have any opportunities available. The fourth and final step is to apply for those opportunities and start working with the company.
21/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 71 386 8072: Thank you for your time😌
22/12/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday!🌸
Hope you are well.

Let's dive into today's session🚀
22/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 386 8072: Morning
22/12/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
22/12/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
We can do that via platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly Linked In.
I will need you to create your accounts on all these platforms and share your usernames with me in our session in the format mentioned below:
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
Linked In Id Link:

Now, When you have created the accounts on all these platforms, You can use the search features provided on all these platforms to look for companies that suit our criteria.
22/12/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I would like to tell you that currently this project is on hold due to a high volume of ongoing projects and commitments.
22/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 386 8072: Instagram username....linden0507
22/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 386 8072: So when am l going to carry it out
22/12/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will let you know.
22/12/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
22/12/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/12/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 386 8072: The project is understandable 😌and seems like it's not that challenging
22/12/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 386 8072: From what I understand, the audio is saying that the goal of the "community building" project is to help students develop networking and persuasion skills. It's also about teaching students how to use social media to connect with others and join the educational ecosystem. The idea is to create a sense of community where everyone feels a sense of belonging and can work together towards a common goal. Did I get that right? 😊
22/12/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.


1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
22/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay
22/12/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
22/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 386 8072: Noted
22/12/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*NKAZIMULO/ADITI*
22/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 386 8072: Ms Aditi l have a situation here......well one of my friends has already created such a group and most of my contacts are in that group so should l also create one like that
22/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 386 8072: null
22/12/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes.
22/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay
22/12/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/12/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/12/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill

22/12/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
22/12/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/12/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
