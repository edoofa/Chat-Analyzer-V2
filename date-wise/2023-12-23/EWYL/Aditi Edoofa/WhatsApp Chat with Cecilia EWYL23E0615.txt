Hope you are well.
25/09/23, 9:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand and please be there on time for your today's session.
25/09/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
25/09/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Thank you Ms Aditi
25/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 822 3195: I surely understand the information of the program structure
25/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

25/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
25/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Cecilia, So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
25/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 911 5643: In this news later ,I am being reminded what life is in it's complete form.Being able to interact with the people I can reach out to ,sharing experiences and growing with each other ,that is happiness in this life.Also,helping the needy in any way possible,I feel like I contribute a fair share to the world.
25/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 911 5643: The quotes are my favorite section ,they are an inspiration to me.Somehow, I am urged to keep on keeping on .
25/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
25/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 911 5643: It definitely is.If I may know,who exactly gets mentioned in such a prestigious session.As in,what is the threshold?

26/09/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Cecilia’s EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure Cecilia is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
26/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Thank you so much  Ma'am for the set inspiring goals you have for Cecilia,this is eñcoraging indeed,

26/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Cecilia* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
26/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

You can go through it and let Cecilia be informed about the same.
26/09/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Cecilia* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things she is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully

03/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Let me contribute on item 3... Skills and competences Cecilia is blessed with. Cecilia is a keen debater and public speaker,whose inspirational speeches seek to steer the audience towards causing,as well as actively participating in positive behavior change for the youth, especially the girl child. Cecilia is an adept, empathetic active listener,whose motto is "Yes we can". In short, she's largely optimistic. I have observed Cecilia to be blessed with good interpersonal communication skills that have seen her win competitions and awards,by easily reaching out to bot the judges/adjudication teams and audience alike. This,if properly tapped can earn her good EWYL credit points.
03/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Cecilia's experience in article writing and positive use of social media can easily be harnesses for positive use in EWYL projects. She is good at research and project documentation,has can employ such skills in her EWYL projects.

She is a captivating speaker who is deeply committed to driving positive behavioral changes, particularly for the girl child.

03/10/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing!
I can assure you that Cecilia will reach great heights and I will help her throughout.
03/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 993 4323: Would greatly appreciate that,thank you so much!!
03/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

04/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 822 3195: We have network challenges at the present moment
04/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
04/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Noted.
04/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once *Cecilia* is back, she is supposed to note a few things.

 In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
04/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: All the conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
04/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
04/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Understood Ms Anditi,we are together
04/10/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
04/10/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Cecilia’s session will be on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In the session, following are requirements to be followed.
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share the lesson and activity response before session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
04/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 822 3195: That's clear will be on time always and follow procedures
04/10/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
04/10/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Cecilia has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
04/10/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
04/10/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help her to fund her higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
04/10/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
04/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 822 3195: All noted with thanks
04/10/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know when will she resume her EWYL Process and on which date?

 I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
04/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 822 3195: Once we are able to get in contact with her(Cecilia) we will do every requirement needed with us ma'am
04/10/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you so much.
04/10/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

22/12/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 873 6211: Am I targeting Schools that are in my country only?
22/12/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: You are more than welcome to target outside your country as well

22/12/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 873 6211: Understood

22/12/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 873 6211: Okay...after their diploma programs would they be eligible for applying for degree courses as other A'level graduates
22/12/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: In some particular fields, they would be able to do so.
22/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 873 6211: Okay I understand
22/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*CECILIA/ADITI*
22/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 873 6211: I understand ma'am We may proceed
22/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
