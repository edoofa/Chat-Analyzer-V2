05/08/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 731 1354: Greetings ma'am.  I received the later yesterday  .  We are still running around.  I will update you later ma'am
05/08/23, 10:19 am - +91 78273 08969: Congratulations on the letter.
Thank you so much for sharing.
05/08/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 731 1354: Ma'am  the problem is visa application process is done during the week.  When i received the letter yesterday both my parents where at work and they end work at 1700hrs. So its hectic this side . My parents  are also trying to run around but its proving to be hard. I am not sure of the traveling arrangements.  The admission team only sent the letter and did not share an update regarding the same .


I wanted to thank you ma'am for being an amazing mentor and for listening to  all my problems and offering a solution.  I would also like to thank the whole Edoofa  team for the job well done . I have learnt  a lot  from EDOOFA  and i can proudly say that I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN.   My parents have suggested that i restart the whole process that is to apply and re do the whole process.  Your hardwork as Edoofa is greatly  appreciated 👏 I am forever grateful 👏.
05/08/23, 10:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Delight, May I know if the admission team has replied to you?
05/08/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 731 1354: Ma'am  i want to ask for permission  to  send forms to you even though  i have put my journey to come to India on hold  since i am in contact with some students who are interested and i would like to help them have their dream of studying abroad a reality.  Ma'am  if it is allowed,  if i managed to earn any credits please give them to some Edoofians as well as my points for the Grant. To the whole Edoofa team i really appreciate.
05/08/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 731 1354: I didn't  want to keep on pressuring them ma'am.  We know they really work hard and there is no more time left ma'am hence we decided to restart the whole process when  there is time ma'am. I really appreciate their hard work.
05/08/23, 10:39 am - +91 78273 08969: Delight, Please do not worry.
I have asked the admission team. I will make sure you come to India and Fulfill your goals.
05/08/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 731 1354: Ma'am I really appreciate but at this moment ma'am my emotions are all over the place.   I think restarting the whole process is best after all it was my fault of failing to notice the error when there was time. Its for the best ma'am dont worry next year if there is a January intake i will surely be there in India. As you said i am still an EDOOFIAN and i am a PROUD EDOOFIAN indeed.

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

17/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 794 1895: All people  have different  studying methods. Some methods that have helped me is when I read my notes I write short notes in a separate  book. After having done that, I give myself some time  to rest then I jot down what I understood whilst reading and go through my notes to see if I have left important information.  The short notes help a lot since I would have jotted down the important details whereby  when I am now studying for my tests I won't have  to read a lot of information including some which is unnecessary.
