31/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 130 2927: Good evening Ms Ananya I will be sharing with you my understanding on the EWYL document.

The document basically elaborates more on how the EWYL projects are to be carried out with the aim of helping Edoofians gain work- related skills in consideration of the evolving technology,while also the student can financially fund a part of their University fee through acquiring scholarship credits.

The first project involves searching for technology companies that are willing to partner with Edoofa,the second stage involves calls and vedio calls between leaders of the selected company and members of the Edoofa Scholarship board.The final stage involves signing of a contract between these two.For each process a certain amount is rewarded t an Edoofian  by Edoofa for example.for each call made $2 worth of Scholarship credits is rewarded and also the signing of an MoY gives them about $20 worth of Scholarship credits.

The second project.involves the Edoofian out to their fellow students enlightening them about the benefits of Edoofa Scholarship Programme and convincing them to register for the Edoofa Scholarship Programme.The Edoofian is required to  reach out to various schools this will help one to acquire valuable skills such as good communication and also being influential.For every student they enrolls into Edoofa Scholarship Programme and pays part of their enrollment fee Edoofian will get $20 worth of Scholarship credits.

06/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 130 2927: Good.morning Ms Ananya .I hope you had a great weekend.Unfortunately I am currently facing some network difficulties so pardon for my late response
06/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, Flora!
06/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 130 2927: Oook Ms Ananya.am I to post my tale on Instagram as well
06/11/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
06/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
06/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
06/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
06/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
06/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
06/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

06/11/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 130 2927: Very well Noted
06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
06/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.

I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
06/11/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since today's session is over, let's plan to connect in our next session, which is scheduled for tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. Before our next session, feel free to share your understanding of the third project.

06/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 130 2927: Please pardon for my poor network connection
06/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 130 2927: I will do so thank you for the session
06/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 130 2927: The third project is called the African Schools Education Reform Mission ,this project requires me to make a list of local.schools in my community and the first option can be my own school.I should approach my teachers telling them about Edoofa Scholarship Programme ,how I got enrolled with Edoofa and how lucky I am to be part of the Scholarship Programme,tell them about my experiences and the skills I have gained through Edoofa and also how I will archive my career goals and dreams through Edoofa Scholarship Programme.Then I will talk to the headmaster and schedule a meeting between him or her with the Edoofa director.
07/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
07/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *TUESDAY* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

I hope you are doing well. I've noticed that you consistently join the session late without my reminder. Your sessions are scheduled, and I've been waiting for you on your EWYL Line. Being punctual demonstrates dedication and sincerity not only to the program but in all aspects of life.

I want to emphasize the importance of punctuality. Is it acceptable if I don't conduct the session if you are not here on time? <This message was edited>
