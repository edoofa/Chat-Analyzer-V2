16/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 315 9162: Alright let me do it now
16/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 315 9162: My education journey started way back in 2008 in Elementary school. During this time I wasn't that bright and performed as an average student. After I graduated I continued this journey at Southerton primary. I struggled a little bit during the first years at this school but eventually I would go on to become one of the best students at the school and finished with excellent results. It was also at this school that I discovered that school was not only my calling but  also playing soccer was another talent i had.I was also one of the best at my school. I finished junior school in 2017 and proceeded with my journey at Howard High School, a boarding school in Chiweshe. It was at this school that I founded my true inner being and my purpose in life. Through the various clubs I joined and some inspirational friends I met I became more ambitious and motivated to achieve finer things in life. It was at this stage that my obsession for business started. I started studying hard and slept late to achieve better grades and it paid off as l came out with good results. These where my results for ordinary level:
Accounting       A
Geography        A
Business Studies  B
Mathematics      B
English           B
Combined Science B
Shona.           B
History           B
Agriculture       D
Shona literature   E
I also continued playing soccer at this school and at one time we almost went to the nationals but the tournament was cancelled due to the corona virus pandemic. I left Howard High school in 2022 and I went on to study my Advanced level at Best college. I was the in the commercial class where I studied Accounting, Business Studies and Pure Mathematics. At this school things weren't going well for me. I took extra classes to keep up with my standards. We wrote our final examinations this year in November and the  results will be out in mid January. I also continued playing soccer at this school and we won the annual school tournament where I was nominated for the player of the tournament award. 

Both my parents are present. Im the first born in my family and i have 3 siblings. My father is 43 and unemployed. He runs a small restaurant in our town where I'm also working. He did fine in school and managed to attain a degree in accounting. My mother is 38 and she is also unemployed. She managed to write her ordinary level but her mother would eventually die and she would drop out of school to work and support her siblings.
16/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! The combination of athletics and academics is indeed exquisite. I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Kelly. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable.  From overcoming challenges in your early years to emerging as one of the best students and soccer players at your school, you've demonstrated resilience and determination. The discovery of your passion for business and commitment to academic excellence during your time at Howard High School is truly commendable. Even in the face of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, your dedication to your studies and soccer pursuits shines through. Transitioning to Best College for your Advanced level studies showcases your unwavering pursuit of knowledge. Your involvement in soccer and academic achievements, including the nomination for the player of the tournament award, reflects your well-rounded and accomplished character! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?
16/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 315 9162: Thank you
16/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 315 9162: My Father was an accountant but he left the job after the company was closed ,so after this he used his personal savings to start a clothes store  which also shutdown after two years because it wasn't performing well,  so he then took a loan from the bank and opened the restaurant which he is running now in 2014 . My Mother is a clothes runner and hasn't been employed to any company.
16/12/23, 11:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your parents exemplify resilience and entrepreneurship in the face of challenges. Despite the closure of the initial ventures, Mr. Floyd's decision to use personal savings to start a clothes store and later transition to a restaurant, where he has been successfully running the business since 2014, speaks volumes about his determination and adaptability. Entrepreneurs like your father play a crucial role in shaping local economies and communities. Additionally, Mrs. Precious's dedication as a clothes runner, showcasing her independent spirit, adds another layer to the family's industriousness! Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of your siblings, please?
16/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 315 9162: I have 3 siblings,  Keith my second brother who is 16yrs old and he is writing is O level next year, Junior the third one who is 10 and  Grade 5 next year and also the last one, Kayden who is 3 years old
16/12/23, 11:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for being articulate, Kelly. So, could you kindly tell me how much *Best Choice College* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
16/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 315 9162: It was $260 per term, both my parents support me
16/12/23, 11:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
16/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 315 9162: We don't think they will be able to support my education abroad financially that's why we are finding a scholarship or an affordable university
16/12/23, 12:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Pursuing tertiary education abroad requires financial planning. May I know whether your family has contrived a financial plan for the respective decision?
16/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 315 9162: No they have not
16/12/23, 12:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You've expressed your aspiration to pursue your tertiary education abroad, and I truly commend your decision, as it's a pivotal step towards enhancing your employability. I would respectfully suggest that you engage in a thoughtful conversation with your parents about the financial aspects of this endeavor. Once you've had the opportunity to do so, please feel free to reach out to me. I will be eagerly awaiting your response.
16/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 315 9162: Noted
16/12/23, 12:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Kelly. After the scholarship, there is some miscellaneous amount. May I know who will be helping you with that amount, please?

16/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 315 9162: But if I manage to get a seat can I apply to counties like Poland where living expenses are quite low and also tuition fees are affordable
16/12/23, 1:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have done some research regarding the cost of education abroad, please?
