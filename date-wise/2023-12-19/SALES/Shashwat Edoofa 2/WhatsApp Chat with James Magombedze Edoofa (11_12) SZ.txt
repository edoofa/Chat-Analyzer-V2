12/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir. Thank you for the opportunity 👏

My name is *James Magombedze*  and I was born on 08 June 2000 at Musiso (St Anthony) Hospital.
I am a firstborn son of *Joice Hasani* and *Andrew Magombedze.* Both of my parents are peasant farmer.

My parents have seven children and I'm the firstborn. As a family we depend on peasant (small scale) farming for survival.

 *About my education:* 

I did my primary level at Judea Primary School and my Ordinary Level at *Hippo Valley Secondary School.* 2017 is the exact year I sat for my Ordinary Level Exams and I came out with 8 out of 9 Subjects which graded C and better, including *English and Science* but without Mathematics. 
    Due to financial instability in my family, I failed to start my Advanced Level Course in 2018. After working in sugarcane fields I succeeded to start my Advanced Level Course in February 2019 at *Matara Christian Secondary School*  . In *November 2020* I sat for my Advanced Level Exams . My results are as follows: Literature in English *C* , Sociology *B* , History *C* , Family and Religious Studies *A* . I did Arts Studies *(Lit in English* , *Sociology* , *Family and Religious Studies* and *History* ) at my Advanced Level.
 
It was my wish and is still to continue with my education upto University but due to financial breakdown in my family I failed to do so. I tried to work in dangerous mines but nothing yielded.
12/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 351 7754: Fortunately, there's someone who commiserated with me on my situation and told me about Edoofa. He urged me to apply for a scholarship. That's what I really did and I have a great hope that with you my dream will come true!
12/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 351 7754: *About my favorite hobbies and interests:*

*Reading, writing and singing music 

 *My ambition*

As a young man who loves a society *which is shaped with justice,* my dream is to study and work in *legal field.*
12/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 351 7754: Thank you 👏
12/12/23, 10:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You have expressed everything vividly, and it is absolutely enthralling to know that your vision aligns with your eagerness to refine and enhance society and its laws. Your passion for reading, writing, and singing music showcases a diverse range of talents and interests. Your commitment to these creative endeavors is commendable and reflects a well-rounded individual with a love for both literature and the arts. Such dedication to self-expression and artistic pursuits undoubtedly contributes to personal growth and enriches the lives of those around you! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?
12/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, thank you!

Both of my parents do not have any certificate of education so they are self employed. To take care of the family they depend on peasant farming. They just have a small piece of land in Chiredzi rural area which they cultivate and sell the produce for my young brothers to go to school.
12/12/23, 10:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your parents' dedication to taking care of the family through peasant farming speaks volumes about their resilience and commitment. Despite the challenges, they make the most of their resources, cultivating a small piece of land in Chiredzi rural area to provide for the family and ensure your younger brothers can attend school! So, could you kindly tell me how much *Matara High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
12/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 351 7754: Yeah, in 2019 to 2020 when I did my Advanced Level, school fees at Matara High School was equivalent to US $25. 
    At the first term I payed school fees and for myself but later on my School headmaster, Mr Allen Raisi assisted me. My father also payed for me but not always.
12/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 351 7754: For the first term I payed school fees for myself and later on received an assistance from the school headmaster. My father also played a role

12/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?

12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Joice!
12/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 351 7754: I tried to seek a financial help from different relatives but I found no one. There's only one uncle who promised to help me but not in everything
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on the matter, please?
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, he just told me that he can offer me a little help when I need it
12/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You've expressed your aspiration to pursue your tertiary education abroad, and I truly commend your decision, as it's a pivotal step towards enhancing your employability. I would respectfully suggest that you engage in a thoughtful conversation with your parents/ family about the financial aspects of this endeavor. Once you've had the opportunity to do so, please feel free to reach out to me. I will be eagerly awaiting your response.
12/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, thank you so much

12/12/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, I don't know If I understand it right. I also just want to know, they are some students like me who come from a poor background. I'm financially crippled but with a dream of being someone in future. *How can Edoofa help me to fulfill my dream in life?*
12/12/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Those who can financially support me are not capable of supporting me in everything since already they have their families to take care of. What can I do to make my vision come true?
12/12/23, 5:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Okay Sir, thank you so much! That 09:00 am is a good time

I also understood that Edoofa offers free career guiding and counseling to the students which is very good. That's what I understood when I read it Sir. If there's something missed you can further explain for me Sir, I'm eager to learn more.

I don't know if it is necessary, I can give you his WhatsApp contact Sir
13/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 351 7754: ***he promised to help me with little he has***

13/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 351 7754: Yes, we discussed about it Sir, and he said if I receive even a 50% Scholarship on tuition fee it will be easier for him to pay the amount remains. He said it is difficult for him to start from the scratch

14/12/23, 9:14 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether James is available for the session, please?
14/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 274 9214: @918350976168 . I am motivated to expose James to opportunities.  I am concerned that - despite his academic achievements so far - he is now stuck.
14/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 351 7754: I'm available Sir, good morning
14/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 274 9214: His parents are peasants.  They are extremely poor.  So , they have failed to sponsor him beyond advanced level.
14/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 351 7754: Good morning my granduncle
14/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 274 9214: Morning, Jimmy.  I won't be available for this discussion  much longer.  I am very busy. I am on a field  mission for Care International
14/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 351 7754: Alright uncle, noted. Thank you so much for your loving kindness
14/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 274 9214: I would have loved to participate actively and meaningfully in this discussion, but I am actually  in the middle of other activities.  

What I would like to mention is: James really needs assistance. I, indeed, am his uncle (in the sense of the African Extended family) . 

1. My late father was a brother  to James ' late great grandfather' 
2. I am a cousin to James' grandfather. 
3. I could, therefore, be more realistically regarded as a 'grandfather' from the other line. 
4. I have five siblings. These have children.  Most of them are looking up to me to assist with their education. I have a pool of needy people around me, and I do not even think I am equal to the expectations.
5. Meanwhile, I have four children of my own and my mother who also need my support. 

6. In the circumstances, I am appealing to organisations like Edoofa to support James to the highest extent possible.  I wouldn't mind if he can work for some companies there in India to earn his scholarship.  

This is a summary of what motivates me to try and push James out the- to expose him to possibilities of assistance in a situation when my own capacity is constrained by realities around me.
14/12/23, 9:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Farai. May I know whether you will be able to support him with his tertiary education, please?
14/12/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 274 9214: How much would be required per year? My circumstances are as described above.
14/12/23, 9:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 7:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, thank you! My granduncle is a busy man as he already said above but I ask that you may have patience with me. I beg your help and guidance for me to put my dreams into reality. I wish to do something great in life through education as others of my age are doing. It's my aspiration to be someone in future through education!
16/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 274 9214: Good morning, Shashwat. Just a quick question? Is there a possibility that an extremely vulnerable individual gets a 100% Scholarship?
16/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 274 9214: Colleagues... Good morning!
16/12/23, 10:12 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

16/12/23, 10:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, James and Mr. Farai!
16/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 274 9214: @918350976168 Sure, how about you?
16/12/23, 10:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly elaborate on your query, please?
16/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 274 9214: What is the highest level of scholarship that Edoofa can provide.  Are there situations where edoofa gives a scholarship that is equivalent to the tuition fees requirements e.g in circumstances where there is verifiable evidence of extreme vulnerability on the part of the applicant?
16/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 274 9214: Just to be specific to the current case. I only got to know of James' predicaments this year, yet he completed Advanced level in 2020. I  am  exposing to the outside world because I know the poverty levels of his parents but at the same time I am surrounded with more needs than my capacity can bear. So I am trying to create linkages for James... some threads for his cross over...
16/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 274 9214: * .... I am exposing him...
16/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 274 9214: In a scenario of this nature, I am kindly appealing to EDOOFA and its partners to provide a 100% scholarship to James, attaching whatever conditions you may, as long as this brilliant mind does not go to waste.
16/12/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Kindly excuse me for the delay. I am in a meeting with the academic board regarding your application. Thank you for your patience.
16/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, thank you!
16/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 274 9214: Well noted. Thank you very much.
16/12/23, 2:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A delightful evening to everyone! I hope you are having a wonderful day!
16/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Good evening Sir
16/12/23, 2:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am fully aware of the economic hardships that James and his family are facing, and I commend your efforts in trying to create linkages for him. I understand that the needs around him are vast, and your compassionate efforts to navigate through these challenges are truly admirable, Mr. Farai. However, I believe you must be familiar with the fact that *Edoofa* is a Merit-Based Scholarship Program and not a charitable organization, please.  The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews. Additionally, his/her academic results, O level, and A level results. Moreover, his/her participation in extracurricular activities will be taken into account as well. Furthermore, may I inquire if you are familiar with the criteria for receiving a 100% scholarship and the recipients of such scholarships?
16/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Hie Sir,
I think Mr Farai isn't available for this moment. Since he knows that we are in the discussion I hope he will be right back as soon as possible.
Thank you for your great concern over my matter Sir!
16/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 274 9214: Good afternoon.  My apologies.  I am traveling and connectivity is weak at some points along the way. 

I am not familiar with the criteria for a 100% scholarship.  I am, however, familiar with James' socio-economic background, and I am also aware that he passed his Advanced level examinations.  If there are tests to be written and interviews to be undertaken, James is at your disposal: to be tested in whatever manner you deem appropriate.  

I am pained by the reality of his situation. I would like to connect him to the next level. Should EDOOFA provide James with a 100% scholarship even with strings attached, I would really be grateful.
16/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic (A Grades in all subjects for A-level and O-level)
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Work Experience (if any)
6. Recommendation from Edoofa.

May I know whether James fulfils the criteria, please?
16/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 274 9214: James is available. Hecan answer these questions for himself. 

What I may give you is context.  Matara secondary school (which James) is a rural school. Rural schools in Zimbabwe tend to have less resources and less qualified teachers than urban schools.  The grades may actually  reflect a mix of the applicant's capabilities and the lack of resources at the school attended.
16/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 274 9214: @263783517754 Kindly respond to these please
16/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 274 9214: @918350976168 Would you kindly  specify what you consider under number 2 (merit)
16/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 351 7754: To be truthful and honesty, number 1 can be a challenge since the year I sat for my exams it was the same year COVID 19 struck our nation so schools closed for six months. My A, Level results are as follows:
Lit in English C
Sociology B
F R S A and
History C
16/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 351 7754: I had an opportunity to do better than that but due to lack of resources at Matara Christian Secondary and a COVID 19 pandemic which disturbed my studies for 6 months, I failed to reach the level you stated at point number 1. When it comes to the issues of interviews I'm ready for it.
16/12/23, 4:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 351 7754: Good morning colleagues.
Yes we can start Sir
18/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 274 9214: Good morning, Shashwat. Yes, we can begin. I am busy today but here and there I will try to participate.
18/12/23, 9:51 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, James and Mr. Farai!
18/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 351 7754: Sure Sir, thank you!
18/12/23, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your resilience in the face of challenges, such as resource limitations at Matara Christian Secondary and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, is truly commendable. Despite these obstacles, your commitment to overcoming them and your readiness for interviews reflect your determination and positive attitude, James. Well, before we move ahead with your course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad. Also please share pictures of your previous qualifications results for evaluation. Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well
18/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 351 7754: Thank you for the opportunity Sir!
November 2020 is an exact year I sat for my Advanced Level exams at Matara Secondary School.
Studying abroad can help me to have an access to sophisticated academic resources which will help me to excel during my studies. 
Furthermore, India is famously known of moulding role models through education so I'm convinced.

18/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 351 7754: It's my wish to work with people from different nations in the future, so through studying abroad I can gain experience since I will meet friends from different parts of the world. Through mingling with friends from different parts of the world I can learn more about my dream profession.
18/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 351 7754: Thank you!
18/12/23, 10:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I kindly enquire about your endeavors since 2020, please?
18/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir, in August 2021 I applied for a short term job with  Delta Beverages Zimbabwe in expectation of raising some money for starting my academic journey at tertiary level. Unfortunately, it was to late when I heard about the opportunity so my application letter didn't received.
      From there, in 2022 I worked in some dangerous mines here in Zimbabwe in trial to raise some money to fund my fees at tertiary level it didn't work. Salaries were extremely very low and the conditions were very dangerous.
      In 2023 I applied for a Zimbabwe Prisons Correctional Services Department (ZPCS) but I failed due to the age limit. Currently I am 23 years old, so the maximum age the ZPCS accept is 22 years old if an applicant doesn't hold any other academic certificate which is more than Advanced Level Certificate.
18/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 351 7754: Honestly, I'm financially crippled Sir. Unlike in other countries, in Zimbabwe it is difficult even to find a party time job from which I can get money to commence my tertiary education. I tried retailing but due to economic hardships in Zimbabwe everything failed.
18/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 351 7754: I have an ability to do much better in life if I find an opportunity.
18/12/23, 12:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Kindly excuse me for the delay. I am in a meeting with the academic board regarding your application. Thank you for your patience.
18/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Well noted Sir, thank you👏
18/12/23, 1:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, James. I kindly request you and your family to consider creating a comprehensive financial plan, as pursuing education abroad is a significant undertaking that necessitates thorough mental and financial preparation. You can reapply for the program once you have made the preparations, James! I wish you nothing but the best!
18/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Alright Sir.
I would like to thank you ( *Mr. Shashwat, Mr. Jyotishman and Mr. Sahil.* ) for your great concern over my future. Your efforts and sympathies are appreciated! Thank you very much for your best wishes over my life. Your best wishes God will grant. He will open the doors for excellence and success. 
        I also would like to thank my granduncle, *Mr. Farai Magombedze*  for standing with me before and during the session! My granduncle, your efforts are appreciated. I'm much grateful!
       Furthermore , I also would like to thank my mother ( *Joice Hasani* ) and father ( *Andrew Magombedze* ) for their availability throughout the process. My parents,may your great care and eagerness to help me continue even in the future events!

Colleagues, because of your precious efforts and unwavering support of me, I wish you all the best. May God continue to bless you in all your daily activities. I will keep on try until success come over my way of life.
Thank you for your participation! Your precious efforts and eagerness God will reward.
Thank you👏
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 274 9214: Oh, I had not seen this coming coming. Perhaps I was too hopeful.  

Thank you very much for taking us through the process.  Thank you for showing interest in  assisting James. 

@919821838532 , @918350976168 and @917827834323 I understand EDOOFA is NOT a charitable organisation.  In submitting James' application to EDOOFA, I  have also exposed James' situation to you at a personal level. Colleagues, I now kindly appeal to  you personally - should opportunity present itself - to link James to charitable organisations or charitable individuals. 

@263783517754 , I have just seen your other side, today. You have humbly accepted a heavy outcome. Your closing remarks reveal yo me the man in you. You are a man. Keep your humility and goodness.  

Do not lose hope. We shall keep trying other avenues. I may not fathom the depth of pain you are hoping through now but I  am sure a day is coming when your transition to the next level will occur. All the unexpected  turns will be history. 

@263783517754 'Weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning!' (Ps. 30:5). Hold on my nephew, hold on!!
18/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 351 7754: Thank you so much for encouragement grandpa. I hope will remain green! One day everything will be fine.
18/12/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 351 7754: ***my hope will remain green!
