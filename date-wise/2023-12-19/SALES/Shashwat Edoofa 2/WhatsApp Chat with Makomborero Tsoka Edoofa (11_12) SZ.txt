16/12/23, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
16/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 133 9475: as i have read  studying in india can make my study be affordable and flexible and i will be able to use a flexible language and i can do some researches too and improve my critical thinking so i can hit my goals perfectly
16/12/23, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
16/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 133 9475: i don't know
16/12/23, 2:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Makomborero! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation

16/12/23, 2:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
16/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 133 9475: we  can not afford it
16/12/23, 2:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
16/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 133 9475: paying the (2000-3000) per year
16/12/23, 3:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makomborero. Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country, please?
16/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 133 9475: its 300  per semester leaving off campus
16/12/23, 3:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
16/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 133 9475: no i would not want that type of education
16/12/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makomborero. If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
16/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 133 9475: ohh i see
16/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 133 9475: thats nice
16/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
16/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 133 9475: can the parents answer this question
16/12/23, 4:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Makomborero. I will be waiting for their response.
16/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 490 3667: We have another child whos is writing o level exams next year so we thinking of  a gap year to Makomborero's university admission but i thought if we could find  fully funded scholarship it could help us <This message was edited>

16/12/23, 5:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what is your understanding of the word "Fully Funded Scholarship", please?
16/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 490 3667: Fully funded scholarship means everything catered for
16/12/23, 6:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

18/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 133 9475: yea
18/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Makomborero!
18/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
18/12/23, 10:45 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether that is clear, please?
18/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 133 9475: clear
18/12/23, 10:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether your parents have read this message, please?
18/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 133 9475: okay
