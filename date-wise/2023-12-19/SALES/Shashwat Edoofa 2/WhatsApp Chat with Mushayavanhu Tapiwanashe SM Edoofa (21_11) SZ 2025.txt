05/12/23, 9:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Tapiwanashe. Your co-operation is highly valued!
05/12/23, 9:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
05/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 754 9720: Thank you Sir for letting me know about this
05/12/23, 9:46 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colours, Tapiwanashe!

05/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 754 9720: My dream profession is being a Mining Engineer
05/12/23, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
05/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 754 9720: That was a job of my dream,  l grew up admiring it .l am a kind of person that aspires to develop infrastructure of a country and l am very interested in such things like Engineering. The reason why the world is now developed is based on Engineering and Technology
05/12/23, 5:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tapiwanashe. May I know whether you are fascinated with technology, please?

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
08/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 754 9720: Yes l am ready Sir
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tapiwanashe!
08/12/23, 12:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this message?
08/12/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 754 9720: Yes but l do not know exactly ,how much does it cost ?
08/12/23, 6:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tapiwanashe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/12/23, 6:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 6:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
08/12/23, 6:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
08/12/23, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 9:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

09/12/23, 1:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what part of the fees is not affordable, please?
09/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 754 9720: I can not afford a minimum of $1200, l would expect a minimum of $ 500
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Pursuing tertiary education abroad requires financial planning. May I know whether your family has contrived a financial plan for the respective decision?
09/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 754 9720: I do not know, l will discuss this issue with my mother

*"Your life is like a book; every day is a new page, and only you hold the pen to write an amazing story." - Tom Hiddleston*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
11/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 754 9720: Good morning, yes l am ready

11/12/23, 9:03 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have had a discussion, please?
11/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 754 9720: Thank you, same applies
11/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 754 9720: Yes l discussed with her but she told me that is too expensive for her
11/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tapiwanashe!
11/12/23, 11:32 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tapiwanashe. Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country, please?
11/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 754 9720: Thank you so much
11/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 754 9720: Yes for example in Zimbabwe we have University of Zimbabwe that  costs $616 US per Cemaster
11/12/23, 11:53 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
11/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 754 9720: I am sorry Sir, l may not afford this
11/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that, Tapiwanashe?
11/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 754 9720: Yes but it depends on the person that pays my fees
11/12/23, 12:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed more light on the matter?
11/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 754 9720: Yes l can do that
11/12/23, 12:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please feel free to share, Tapiwanashe.
11/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 754 9720: Ok l will see time goes on if l will be able to afford that
11/12/23, 12:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tapiwanashe. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

11/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 754 9720: My pleasure Sir
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tapiwanashe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
11/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 754 9720: Yes Sir, it is a very good program and it will be a benefit to me
11/12/23, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
11/12/23, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
11/12/23, 5:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
11/12/23, 5:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

11/12/23, 5:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
11/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 754 9720: Yes thank you Sir, l think this one will be a better option for saving my mother
11/12/23, 5:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Tapiwanashe. May I know whether you think it is affordable now?
11/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 754 9720: Yes l think it can be affordable now
11/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
11/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
11/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
13/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 754 9720: Yes l am ready Sir
13/12/23, 9:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tapiwanashe!
13/12/23, 9:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is good to know, Tapiwanashe. May I know whether she thinks it is affordable now, please?
13/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 754 9720: Yes it is affordable, she has agreed with that
13/12/23, 10:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Tapiwanashe! So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
13/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 754 9720: Yes Thank you Sir
13/12/23, 10:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
13/12/23, 10:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
13/12/23, 10:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:36 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

-*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
13/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 754 9720: Ok Thank you Sir, l have noted this
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Mushayavanhu Tapiwanashe SM Edoofa (21/11) SZ" to "Mushayavanhu Tapiwanashe SM Edoofa (21/11) SZ 2025"
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
13/12/23, 10:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
