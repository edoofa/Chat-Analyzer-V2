My father works as a refrigerator and air conditioner technician with his job and the help of my guidance and counseling teacher who later paid for my form 6 fees since my dad was not able to due to the illness and death of my mother which required a lot of money, I was able to learn at Kwekwe High School from form 1 up to 6. I passed my ordinary level with 6 out of 9 subjects and proceeded for A level. I took the combination of three sciences subjects which were puremathatics, biology and chemistry. As of now I'm waiting for my results. My hobby is singing and I'm interested in helping myself and others keep their health by staying fit and exercising. My ambition is to become a doctor, specifically a surgeon my family inspired me to have this dream it all started when I used to give my grandma her medications and also when I used to check my parent's blood pressure and advising them to take the proper diet and exercises, if anyone of my family members were sick i would always help them in any way possible and this all led up to me having this dream to one day help the sick.

13/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 157 1664: Thank you sir. Kwekwe high school charged $100 US per term and in my family my father is the one who financially supports my education as I've said before due to circumstances my guidance and counseling teacher at Kwekwe high school supported me through out my final year at Kwekwe High school.
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?

13/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 157 1664: Of course, the thing is my father lost a lot of contracts when we had that family issue and things have never been the same ever since the standard of life we are now living is different, so I think its the doubt although I comforted him by telling him that I could be a nurse if the fees for university doesn't add up.
13/12/23, 2:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You've expressed your aspiration to pursue your tertiary education abroad, and I truly commend your decision, as it's a pivotal step towards enhancing your employability.
