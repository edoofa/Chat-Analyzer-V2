I work at a small lodge in Victoria falls Zimbabwe both as a waiter and as a barman.
Basically I depend on tips as the salary is not that good but now with situation of the country the number of tourists has declined so it's just hand to mouth.

I didn't learn much. My highest level of education being O level. Then I did the waiters course thus why I'm in the tourism industry.
Well currently my son will be writing his O levels exams next year. I hope he will do well although his a bit playful at times
As I said earlier I'm based in Victoria falls and my family they are in the country side were we live. I don't have a house here in Victoria falls and to rent the accommodation which can accommodate my family to expensive. I have been in council waiting list for more than 10 years but nothing is coming up because our country is now full of corrupt people.
Thus is it for now

Working both as a waiter and a barman requires versatility and a strong work ethic, and your commitment to providing excellent service is evident. It's clear that you navigate challenges, such as the impact of the country's situation on tourism, with resilience and determination. Depending on tips highlights your customer service skills and your ability to create positive experiences for visitors despite external challenges. Your hands-on approach and positive attitude contribute significantly to the success of the lodge, Mr. Rice! I have confidence that Given is an exceptionally diligent student, and he will undoubtedly demonstrate his capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of Given's siblings, please?

These schoolarships which a gorvenment body sponsors a student completely , right from application to travel to education and living expense "on my understanding  l think that  this organization sponsors the student as well as supplying educational needs and wants, This schoolarship is the dream of ever African student.

18/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 927 8126: Fully funded is a description of a pension plan that has sufficient assets to provide for all the accrued benefits it owes and can thus meet its future obligations.
18/12/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
18/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 927 8126: Okay  l have understood
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know who will be financially supporting your tertiary education abroad, please?
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 927 8126: If my parents would afford they may supoorting and if l found someone who may help
18/12/23, 4:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether they are financially ready to support you, please?
18/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 927 8126: Not yet
18/12/23, 4:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Given. I kindly request you and your family to consider creating a comprehensive financial plan, as pursuing education abroad is a significant undertaking that necessitates thorough mental and financial preparation. You can reapply for the program once you have made the preparations, Given! I wish you nothing but the best!
18/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 927 8126: Oky
