“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 577 3595: Morning morning
15/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 577 3595: Can you tell us more what is needed and what we have to do infact you can tell us everything
15/12/23, 11:09 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Dylan, also do tell me whether you learnt about Dylan’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 394 3484: Umm as far as l remember, l asked him to link me up with you so that l can also get a scholarship and he did gave me an application form to fill in so that he can submit it to you and he did which is what ended up lending us where we are right now 🤷‍♂️
15/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 394 3484: Actually my mom is asking as in which type of scholarship is this one in the sense that am l supposed to pay a certain amount or school fees or its that type whereby everything will be already paid for me all l will be doing is just learning that's what she wants to know exactly as in what exactly is needed for me to study abroad the details in full
15/12/23, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Bright, I would love to answer all these question but I want you to be patient as all these questions will be addressed ahead in the counselling session.
15/12/23, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Dylan, also do tell me whether you learnt about Dylan’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
15/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 394 3484: Okay sure
15/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 394 3484: Umm all l can say is Dylan told me that Edoofa will make it easy for you and they move with you stage by stage until you make it abroad but unfortunately he didn't share anything about his journey and experience
15/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
15/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 394 3484: Yeah true ...so what's the ways forward
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Bright, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 394 3484: Yes of course and as you can see my mom is already participating that much and asking a lot kkkk
15/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, I appreciate her participation in the counselling session.
15/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now Bright, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
18/12/23, 7:33 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
18/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 577 3595: I apologize once again but as l mentioned earlier that we are having challenges with electricity so sometimes the phone will be flat

19/12/23, 8:39 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
19/12/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 394 3484: We don't have electricity here that's the problem but l really want this scholarship to be honest
