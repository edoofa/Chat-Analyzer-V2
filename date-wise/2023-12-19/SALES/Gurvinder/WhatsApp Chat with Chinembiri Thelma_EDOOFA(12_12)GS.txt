12/12/23, 8:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Thelma, Mr and Mrs Chinembiri!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
12/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 415 8096: Ok thank you sir
12/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Thelma,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 415 8096: Ok thank you Mr Gurvinder
12/12/23, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Thelma, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Noah, is that correct?
12/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 415 8096: Yes it correct Mr Gurvinder
12/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Noah, also do tell me whether you learnt about Noah’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Ummm I didn't get to know much of the information I just found his  number in an edoofa group then I get to his inbox and he gave me the application form
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
12/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Thank you sir
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Yes Mr Gurvinder  that's my wish
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Thelma, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Ok sir
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir I think so
12/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 779946730: Hello Edoofa program lam Thelma chinembiri 's father thank very much for giving my daughter an apportunity to get in touch with you.
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you Mr Patrick.

13/12/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Computer Application*
13/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Ok thank you sir
13/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.* 
 Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it. <This message was edited>

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 415 8096: Morning sir
15/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Thelma, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
15/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir I'm willing to give my best efforts
15/12/23, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
15/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 415 8096: The main reason I want to study abroad is to experience overseas atmospheres and to acquire overseas skills which I might not be able to acquire in my country and India has been one of  my dream country
15/12/23, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
15/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 415 8096: I would share the skills I would have acquired to some of the education facilities in my country
15/12/23, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Thelma, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
15/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir I do agree
15/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir 
And about that India is a developing country right
15/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
15/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

15/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now Thelma, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
15/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 415 8096: No sir thank you
15/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
15/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Umm no
15/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
15/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*

I understand
15/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
15/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir u can go ahead
15/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Thelma, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Ok thank you sir I understand
15/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

15/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

15/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir this will benefit me 
My views are that due to the access of the EWYL I might get more skill added to those I'm going to acquire from the program a will be learning and I will be able to know what it means to be an employed person before I even finish my education

16/12/23, 2:03 am - +263 71 415 8096: Ok sir
16/12/23, 8:36 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
16/12/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 415 8096: Morning sir
16/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Thelma, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 415 8096: Yaa basically that would be better costs sir
16/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/12/23, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir
16/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Yes it is sir 
Thank you so much
16/12/23, 8:32 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

18/12/23, 10:33 am - Gurvinder: Alright Thelma, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
18/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 415 8096: Yaa I think so sir
18/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 415 8096: No I haven't because I was planning to step out of parental educational care so as to easy their responsibilities and so that they will be able to pay fees for my siblings so I haven't bother them by discussing international education plans with them .
18/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: I admire your sense of responsibility, Thelma, yes we bring down the cost of education to $2000-$3000 and yes you can self finance a major part of your education through EWYL, but may I know what are your plans if you can't earn enough scholarship credits to fully pay your fees, and rest of the basic living costs?
18/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Umm on that one I'm not sure  sir about what I am going to do
18/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to talk to your parents about the same.

18/12/23, 7:28 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
18/12/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 415 8096: Ok sir
18/12/23, 9:08 pm - +260 779946730: I will to,but financial issues can not allow me to cover up for my kids due to economy of our country.
