You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
07/12/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Okay sir thank you
08/12/23, 7:49 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 014 8716: Am present
08/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Shalom,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 014 8716: Okay My Gurvinder am following
08/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Shalom, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, is that correct?
08/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 014 8716: It's correct but currently we are not financially for all those enrollment fees and the other 50%
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: That is a talk that I would like to have with you parents after the counselling session, Shalom.
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tadiwanashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tadiwanashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Edoofa is a scholarship program that offer 50-100% scholarship......for Edoofa to search for a good university for you, you should pay $350 enrollment fee
The percentage of your scholarship depends on your results
08/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
08/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 014 8716: That's correct
08/12/23, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
08/12/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Thank you sir
09/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,

09/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

11/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 8:04 am - +263 71 694 2691: Good morning Mr Gurvinder. I more than agree with you there.
11/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Shalom, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
11/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
11/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 014 8716: I think so Mr Gurvinder
11/12/23, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Now Shalom, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

13/12/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 014 8716: I am more than confident on my results

13/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Computer Application* course graduates have a variety of career options after completion of the course. Apart from pursuing higher study course such as MCA or any related course, students can secure a job in diverse areas such as software development, banks, ITES, government departments, Education, etc.
13/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: *What is it About?*

BCA sounds perfect and interesting for me
13/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
13/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Having given the opportunity to enroll for BCA is gonna make a huge difference for me. Let me start with my poor back ground how it is going to impact my community! The area I grew up is lacking behind in technology advancement. Not only talking of the girl child upliftment. I'm gonna device some programs that are gonna incorporate the tuition and exposing young girls in my community to new technological programs in BCA. Advancement of those ideologies in such poor communities in African countries too. 

The support I'm gonna get from Edoofa institute is gonna make all these dreams come true. This support will encourage me to champion other girls and students from my background to never lose hope in pursuing their dreams no matter how poor our families are. Inform them that there is someone out there who has our dream at their hearts to help us tackle these financial obstacles to achieve our goals. This organization is Edoofa.
Thank you.
13/12/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Shalom I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Am more than ready Mr Gurvinder
13/12/23, 5:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
13/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Being specific I really want to study in India because according to my research it is the top country that's specializing in computer science and many students have attained their degrees in computer science in India.

Due to the economic melt down in Zimbabwe we've lost the ability to attain latest technology and we've lost educators for computer science than in India where all of these are available.
Also I've researched and found that there is friendly learning environment for students to learn without being disturbed by any protests, ranging from political etc.
India is far much better in tertiary education than our country.
13/12/23, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study in India.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
13/12/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 014 8716: First of all I would bring back the curriculum of India and implement it back here in Zimbabwe

Moreover, I would try to send more youth in India so that they can learn so that they come back and implement their skills and try to develop the Zimbabweans education system.

Furthermore, I would also try on my best level to get the latest technological equipments for learning so that learning can become easy
13/12/23, 7:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
14/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 014 8716: Good morning to you too Mr Gurvinder
14/12/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Shalom, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
14/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 014 8716: I do agree with you Mr Gurvinder
14/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
14/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 014 8716: Yeah that's true
14/12/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
14/12/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

14/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 014 8716: The images are still downloading......our network this side is low
14/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: So now Shalom, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
14/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 014 8716: No questions so far Mr Gurvinder
14/12/23, 12:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
14/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 014 8716: No one is familiar with the cost
14/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
14/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
14/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Okay am following.........sounds like India is good for people with poor background
14/12/23, 7:36 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 7:58 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
15/12/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 014 8716: Good morning
15/12/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: Let us continue the session now.
15/12/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Shalom what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/12/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 014 8716: What are the  *Earn while you learn programs*???
15/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: Shalom, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 014 8716: Okay am following
15/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
15/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

15/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
15/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 014 8716: I think this program is a very good and beneficial program. Basically I could benefit from it
15/12/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Shalom, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Okay i understand now
15/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
15/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: @263780148716 Are we still connected?

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
18/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 014 8716: Good morning Mr Gurvinder
18/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 014 8716: We did had a discussion abt it
18/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Am ready
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Shalom as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 014 8716: About $1500-$2250
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Shalom, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Okay and that becomes easy for us
18/12/23, 6:05 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 7:19 pm - Gurvinder: @263780148716 Are we still connected?
18/12/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 014 8716: That's correct
18/12/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 014 8716: Yes sir
