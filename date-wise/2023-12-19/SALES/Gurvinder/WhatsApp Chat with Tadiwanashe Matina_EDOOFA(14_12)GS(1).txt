You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

15/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Matina, as this is a counselling session first I would like to ask I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Promise, is that correct? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 73 335 9996: Yes Sir
15/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 73 335 9996: We are kindly asking for details of all the requirements to be met inorder to qualify for the Scholarship
15/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 73 335 9996: We do not have much detail currently
15/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program first.
15/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
15/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
15/12/23, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 73 335 9996: Thank you so much for the information.
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 73 335 9996: Our Daughter has just completed her A levels majoring in Mathematics, Chemistry and Food Science and is very much interested in joining this program
15/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 73 335 9996: The issue of fees is our major setback
15/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 73 335 9996: University fees are now out of our reach
15/12/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: I understand the issue, Mr Matina.
15/12/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mr Matina, as we start your daughter's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
15/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 73 335 9996: Yes but the main challenge is network which is very erratic
15/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 73 335 9996: Plus I managed to participate since morning
15/12/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: I understand your issue, and I appreciate your participation.
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mr Matina, I would like to know Tadiwanashe better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about Her, her career aspiration do include sharing about:-

18/12/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: I have a question, could you please share what motivates you behind the field of Nutrition and Dietics?
18/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 834 7813: It is mainly my interest in the subject , Food Technology and Design and the desire to turn that into a carrier when I grow up .I would like to learn more about nutrition in the life cycle and turn my passion into something that can help many people follow certain diets to maintain their health .

18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics*
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Okay thank you
18/12/23, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
18/12/23, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Yes sir I am confident about achieving the maximum points needed for a higher quantum of scholarship
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
18/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Yes please
18/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.
18/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.
18/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.
18/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.
18/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.
18/12/23, 2:45 pm - Gurvinder: Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Thank you for the information
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Are there any other jobs that one can do with this degree
18/12/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: A Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Nutrition and Dietetics opens up a variety of career avenues in the field of nutrition, health, and wellness. Some job options include:

Clinical Dietitian/Nutritionist: Working in hospitals or healthcare settings to assess patients' nutritional needs and create personalized meal plans.

18/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Thank you
18/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Yes sir I understood the course
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 834 7813: If I get an opportunity to get into Edoofa's Program I will have a chance to further my knowledge on Nutrition and how best I can help in providing healthier ways to enhance the value of food .I believe that the Edoofa's Program will be a stepping stone towards achievement of my dreams as not many are willing to give away scholarships to underprivileged countries like mine .After completion of the course , I wish to be an aspiring nutritionist , someone who can provide counseling and guidance to patients suffering from diet based health issues.My main goal is to study more on therapeutic diets and reduce loss of many lives and not forgetting helping in the discovery of new ways to treat patients while making suitable meal plans for bettering their health. I also wish to better the lives of those close to me by doing something I am passionate about while also building a name for myself .
18/12/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Tadiwanashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
18/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Yes I am very much prepared
18/12/23, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Getting a chance to learn in a foreign country is a once in a lifetime opportunity, I want to make an impact not only in my country but also in other countries like India, I would also like to mix and mingle with other races for exposure
18/12/23, 5:01 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
18/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 834 7813: Having attained my degree ,I would like to come back to my country and put into practice what I would have learned and help educate the upcoming youths of all kinds of programs that they can do .
18/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tadiwanashe, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
18/12/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 834 7813: That's true ,I agree but we can always make do with what we have
