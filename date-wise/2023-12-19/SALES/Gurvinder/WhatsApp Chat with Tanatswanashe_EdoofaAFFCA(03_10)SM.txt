These words resonate with our shared journey towards success.

I want to express my gratitude for your active participation and dedication. Together, we can make every day count and explore the exciting path that lies ahead. Your presence is invaluable, and it truly makes a difference.

I'd also like to extend my apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Unfortunately, I was feeling under the weather. Nevertheless, I am back and fully committed to supporting you on this journey. Let's continue our pursuit of excellence together!
10/10/23, 9:35 pm - Gurvinder: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response. *My working hours are between 9:00 AM CAT and 4:30 PM CAT*
16/10/23, 6:42 pm - Gurvinder: Dear Students and Parents,

I hope this message finds you well.

 I understand that not everyone can join our morning sessions due to various commitments. *To ensure that I can assist all of you, I will be available for a night session.*

Let's have a discussion tonight. Your success is our top priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. *Usually, my working hours are over by now, but I'm extending them to accommodate your needs.*

26/10/23, 5:02 pm - Gurvinder: Hi, I hope you are in good health.
I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed in your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Saturday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
