12/12/23, 3:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
12/12/23, 3:36 pm - +260 97 9371972: They are better opportunities and it helps to learn more cultures and know other languages. It also bring about interconnection between the two countries
12/12/23, 3:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
12/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 97 9371972: Not yet
12/12/23, 3:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
12/12/23, 3:40 pm - +260 97 9371972: No
12/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
12/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
12/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:48 pm - +260 97 9371972: How does one get help in terms of fees. More especially those who do not have enough money
12/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 3:54 pm - +260 97 9371972: Okay
12/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Before moving on ahead, Do you have any questions regarding the information shared with you so far?
12/12/23, 3:58 pm - +260 97 9371972: Does the program help the students to have the required jobs
12/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
12/12/23, 4:38 pm - +260 97 9371972: Okay thanks

12/12/23, 4:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
12/12/23, 4:55 pm - +260 97 9371972: Yes

12/12/23, 4:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
12/12/23, 4:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/12/23, 4:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/12/23, 5:01 pm - +260 97 9371972: Okay thank you
12/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
12/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

12/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
12/12/23, 5:10 pm - +260 97 9371972: Yes
12/12/23, 5:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please elaborate your answer Nawa!
12/12/23, 5:15 pm - +260 97 9371972: It is just okay and yes it can be able to help me
12/12/23, 5:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me
12/12/23, 5:24 pm - +260 97 9371972: From what I have seen and understood I think this is an aim of edoofa cause it showsvhow you go on with the program
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
12/12/23, 5:27 pm - +260 97 9371972: No I think I have no questions
12/12/23, 5:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:

1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
12/12/23, 5:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
12/12/23, 5:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
12/12/23, 5:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
12/12/23, 5:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
12/12/23, 5:40 pm - +260 97 9371972: Explain more
12/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I did not  understand, Can you elabroate/
12/12/23, 5:44 pm - +260 97 9371972: I didn't understand this question
12/12/23, 5:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please from the 4 points shared above that differentiate Edoofa from the rest of the scholarship program, Which points do you like the most.
12/12/23, 5:47 pm - +260 97 9371972: Visa and fee payment  assistance but I also like the rest
12/12/23, 5:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
12/12/23, 5:48 pm - +260 97 9371972: Oh okay
12/12/23, 5:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
12/12/23, 5:51 pm - +260 97 9371972: Okay interesting
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:55 pm - +260 97 9371972: Okay
12/12/23, 6:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 6:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
12/12/23, 6:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
12/12/23, 6:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 6:29 pm - +260 97 9371972: Okay
12/12/23, 6:30 pm - +260 97 9371972: So this is done after the results right
12/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate?
12/12/23, 6:34 pm - +260 97 9371972: Do you mean the payment should be done before or after the results
12/12/23, 6:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Did you go through the phases in detail?
12/12/23, 6:36 pm - +260 97 9371972: Yes
12/12/23, 6:36 pm - +260 97 9371972: But I didn't really understand
12/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please the enrollment formalities is done before the results
12/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please refer to phase 3 for further clarity
12/12/23, 6:40 pm - +260 97 9371972: Okay so when does the 7 days start
12/12/23, 6:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please after you get selected in the program
12/12/23, 6:40 pm - +260 97 9371972: Oh okay
12/12/23, 6:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.

We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

12/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Excellent, Attempt, Let me sum it up for you. So that you are clear with all the information
12/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Edoofians are provided 50-100% scholarships to study their dream courses alongside working on live projects that help them earn scholarship credits. We help African students in self-financing their Education.
In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.
12/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. let me tell you dear the *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
12/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you now understand the process better?
12/12/23, 7:08 pm - +260 97 9371972: Yes
12/12/23, 7:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you all are aware students from Africa will be reporting to their University's Academic Intake. 

*I would like to take this opportunity to share with you all a few pictures of the students who have recently arrived for their respective intake*

13/12/23, 10:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
13/12/23, 10:10 am - +260 97 9371972: Yes
13/12/23, 10:11 am - +260 97 7786335: Yes for now but not in the afternoon
13/12/23, 10:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
13/12/23, 10:33 am - +260 97 9371972: No
13/12/23, 10:38 am - +260 97 7786335: Maybe I missed it. After she's selected for instance, is it 100% sponsorship or some percentage is paid by parents?
13/12/23, 10:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: To clarify, You can get a 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. 50 % being an assured one if you manage to become an Edoofa Enrollment. And to get a 100% scholarship you have to have a good academic and co-curricular record with strong SOP, merit, work experience and recommendation from edoofa. We will be discussing about the fees in our session ahead in detail!
13/12/23, 10:51 am - +260 97 7786335: Thanks for clarity sir. I think it's just term missed. Thanks
13/12/23, 11:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
13/12/23, 11:15 am - +260 97 9371972: Yes
13/12/23, 12:06 pm - +260 97 7786335: About the 7-days enrollment I understood. Cost of education after the scholarship, I missed this one. What happens?
13/12/23, 12:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: There is a reason that we have provided this 7 day period, which is that the number of applicants for the scholarship is more than 1000 on a daily basis and the number of seats is limited, So if In case the student when selected after the interview fails to provide the enrollment fees on time, Then there will be no extension as it will block a seat for some another student, We are the leading scholarship providing organization to Meritorious students of Africa and we do not want that the deserving students miss on this opportunity, I hope you understand!

In case you do not follow these terms then *Nawa's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *21st or 22nd of December 2023* for $200 and the *20th or 21st of January 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *21st or 22nd of December 2023*
