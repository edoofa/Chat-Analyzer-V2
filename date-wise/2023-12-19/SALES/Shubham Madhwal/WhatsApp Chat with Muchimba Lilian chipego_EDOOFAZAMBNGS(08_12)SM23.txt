Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

My mother passed when I was in my fourth grade and my father is a police officer in Mongu in the western part of Zambia.   My father's highest level of education was grade twelve after that he went for training to be a police officer  . In my secondary school journey my aunty and my uncle have been of been sponsoring my education needs not until I completed my grade twelve in the year twenty- twenty  three which is rather this year.on the part for who is supporting me with my financial needs abroad I am not very sure if my aunty and my uncle will be able to continue giving me support until that that far or maybe another relative of mine will offer me support when I am there.I have one sibling who is my young brother and he will be going in his Ninth grade next year . I was learning at Njase girls secondary school from the year twenty-twenty nineteen to the year twenty-twenty  three  and it is located in choma which is in the southern part of Zambia.The school fees was two thousand two hundred and fifty five for the first two years I was there and it was later reduced to one thousand  five  hundred and fifty five  in the last three years I was there this was because a free education policy was introduced in when the government was changed  . In the year twenty -twenty one  I was given a sponsorship for school fees only as it became a bit difficult for my aunty and my uncle to support me with both my school fees and my trunk food at the same time as they had children and other dependents too.My sponsor was a former Njase girl too.I just hope I qualify to be at your school with my results .

 and so his determination also drives   me to the the passion for business  and the fact that I was very good at calculation while at school also motivate me to pursue this course

Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many.

12/12/23, 6:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash.

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
13/12/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?

13/12/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
13/12/23, 1:17 pm - +260 770182875: YES you have
13/12/23, 1:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
13/12/23, 1:21 pm - +260 770182875: Okay sir
13/12/23, 1:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
13/12/23, 1:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
13/12/23, 1:27 pm - +260 770182875: Okay sir
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 1:53 pm - +260 770182875: Okay noted sir
13/12/23, 1:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
13/12/23, 1:54 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - +260 770182875: Okay
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down

1.      Edoofa's vision and benefits if you're eligible?


2.      Cost of Education in India and the course which you're applying for and Why do we recommend India for higher education?

Through the accept a candidate is guaranteed schoolarship of 50 percent to 100 percent of their tuition fees.Students save up to $1000-$1500in application fees while applying for various Edoofa campuses and and  facilities such as  classes and others may cost more than $2000 without Edoofa but with it they will only cost about $350 to study abroad and if parents are not able to pay in the seven days they can pay a fees of $200 in seven days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

However overtime Rwanda rebuilt itself and survivors played an important role in it's development.Rwanda has alos had some economic problems after the genocide of which some include the decline in the gross domestic product in three out of five years posting a rapid decline at more than fourty percent in  nineteen ninty four the year of the genocide.The nine percent increase in nineteen ninty five the  first postwar year signolled the economic. with this this information you can see a bite of the information on how Rwanda was sixteen years after the gencide .

 Section 6 
I as child have always wanted to be like doctor Lubinda who is a well  known doctor once a Njase girl just like me .  Her determination, belief and motivation in herself which are the aspects that have helped her push to being a successful lady she is  today . Though she was a simple girl on average she made sure she worked very had at school just so that she could be the One who brings change to her family so that they can live better live .she started off as a simple doctor and later  decided to start her own hospital which later developed into many other hospitals in different countries meaning she is industrious not only in Zambia but also in other countries like south Africa and Pakistan too.Her achievement also bust me to believe in myself and be self driven and also make decision to build me not to break me . Though doctor Lubinda was judged for her decision to retire and start her own and also criticized at the same  time she was determined  and she never turned back or changed her mind about it as she had a vision for herself being very successful and rich which Inturn came true and she is now very well to do till date .She even sponsors the vulnerable as well .for this reason her life story become my inspiration to be the best in what I do and also to stick to what I believe in.
