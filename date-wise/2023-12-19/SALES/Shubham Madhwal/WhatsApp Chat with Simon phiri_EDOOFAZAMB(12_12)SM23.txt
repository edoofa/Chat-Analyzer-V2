Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
14/12/23, 11:27 am - +260 770891519: .
It’s a good institution
14/12/23, 11:28 am - +260 770891519: .
I want to be part of you
14/12/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.

Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.. 

Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia
14/12/23, 5:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

My name is Simon phiri I live in Zambia 🇿🇲 town being Lusaka specifically located in garden house near kanyama west clinic, I was raised by both parents Mr and Mrs phiri a family of 6, 5 boys and 1 girl Iam the second of them all and talking of our life history it was not a good thing the reason being the resources for the family to survive was had to find because my father had no job and so life was nothing but struggle.
   I wrote my grade 12 that was last year November at a privet school 🏫 named clamours education center that’s where I did my primary and secondary education it was kinda hard for me to finish schooling because of the fees lucky enough the director was and is an understanding man he played a role in helping till I wrote my exams and got good results.
  Since my childhood my main interest was in computers 💻 and I grow up wanting and wishing to study 📚 them, then I came to know that there is computer science wich is the course I want to study 📚 at my tertiary level.
   . My daddy is a business man he sows clothes that’s what he has been doing unfortunately the business is not that good to support us to go for our tertiary education and our home situation though we keep up and survive in what he does by the grace of God.
   My parents both never complete they school 🏫 am not really sure as to why as far as I know the both ended up in grade 9 due to some Certain reasons which I don’t know.
   My parents have been there for me in my education sector helping with the little thing they had they did their best to pay for me though nothing was favoring us.
   For my tertiary education I would say my parents would be helping though I know it won’t be easy because of these others( brothers and. My sister) are still at school so it won’t be a success because I know that’s the reason am seeking for anybody( sponsor )willing to help me with the necessary things to go to school.
    Of course I have they are still schooling as well.
   Clamours education center was the school I did my primary and secondary level it is in Lusaka province, per term the A-level school fees was k550
