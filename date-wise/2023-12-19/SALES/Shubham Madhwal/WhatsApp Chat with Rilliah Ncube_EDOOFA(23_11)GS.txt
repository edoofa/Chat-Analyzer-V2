23/11/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning Rillia, Mr. and Mrs. Ncube!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Good afternoon
23/11/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Rilliah,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
23/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 196 9072: Good afternoon
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Oky noted
23/11/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Mr.Ncube .
23/11/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Rilliah, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Angel, is that correct?
23/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Yes sir
23/11/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Angel, also do tell me whether you learnt about Angel’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Oky so what I learnt was that the Edoofa Program is a program which costs less than most of the University's in Zimbabwe and not only that but you can earn while you learn too. One should take not to learn about the 5' S in order to qualify for the scholarship which include:
1.sensibility
2.self-analysis
3.self-questioning
4.self-absorption
5.scrutiny

In Angel's side of the story she underwent an investigation by asking her seniors that were already at University's and some done and noted that one should compromise his course due to limited seats and also it was noted that the number of graduates unemployed is very high. She wanted to support her family interms of finance that's when she came about the Earn While you learn Program offered at Edoofa which gives opportunities for one to earn through the course
That's all I learnt
23/11/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer Rilliah, I see you are well informed.
23/11/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: But let me also brief you about the program.
23/11/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Yes indeed
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Rilliah, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Yes I do
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Rilliah, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

*Bachelor of Arts in Geography*
29/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky it sounds interesting can you please add more in this study
29/11/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky

30/11/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Rilliah, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
01/12/23, 7:58 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Good evening sir...
Im really sorry for the late replies...
01/12/23, 5:35 pm - +263 71 231 3286: You gave me this assignment so I would like to respond to it now..
01/12/23, 5:35 pm - +263 71 231 3286: So after the completion of Bachelor of Arts in Geography and being supported by Edoofa Program I see my self excelling. Not only because of love and passion for geography fueling this but I want to protect the environment and also including it's flora and fauna. For my career prospect I'm not really sure which I should choose because all the careers mentioned are all good and I would love to venture in all of them. Although I'll be new and also working I really want to solve the problem of global warming and reduce it to it's lowest percentage so as to promote longer life existence not only the environment but also the people too. Meaning with everything I would have learnt I'll propose an idea to eliminate the use of non renewable sources such as gas and oil as the are the most that contribute to global warming being emitted by industries and cars etc and introduce the more usage of renewable sources such as solar power and wind. I know tackling this problem will be very difficult as some have tried and failed since we can't live without these non renewable sources as they power most of the things but I'm very positive with the right people having the same mentality as mine we will prosper against all odds
02/12/23, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Rilliah, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
02/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
04/12/23, 8:06 am - +263 71 231 3286: Good morning
04/12/23, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session.
04/12/23, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/12/23, 8:33 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky so apart from the Universities at my country that are very expensive at other countries it is affordable not only that I want to change an environment learn how people from other countries do their things what's the difference between my country and theirs
04/12/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 231 3286: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 231 3286: I'll contribute my learning by helping the underprivileged
04/12/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Rilliah, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
04/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 231 3286: I agree
04/12/23, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?

04/12/23, 11:45 am - Gurvinder: So now Rilliah, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 231 3286: Yes I would like to ask a question since edoofa offers scholarships to study in India only do you have such a program  where one can be an exchange student for a certain period?
04/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Unfortunately Rilliah, we don't as exchange programs are generally expensive and out of budget for most of the parents.
04/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 231 3286: Oh oky noted
04/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
04/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 367 2760: No sir
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Noted
04/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Mrs.Ncube what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Okay sir.
04/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Should Rilliah get a scholarship, are we the ones who will pay for the air tickets
04/12/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of travelling to India is a one-time cost that you have to bear, Mrs Ncube, but our experts will be there to also help you in the VISA application process.
04/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Noted sir
04/12/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Yes sir
04/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Ncube, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
04/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Noted
04/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Noted
04/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
04/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

04/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
04/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Yes
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mrs.Ncube, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Noted sir now I understand
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 367 2760: The fees would be reasonable
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
04/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Yes it is sir. Thank you so much
04/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Ncube, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
04/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Okay sir
04/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs.Ncube, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Rilliah for her higher education.
04/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Yes sir
04/12/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
04/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 367 2760: Yes sir
04/12/23, 7:10 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
05/12/23, 8:10 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 367 2760: Okay sir
05/12/23, 9:23 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 231 3286: Yes
05/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Rilliah as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 231 3286: The student may end up spending $1500-$2250
05/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Rilliah, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/12/23, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky
05/12/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
05/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 231 3286: I do
05/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky
05/12/23, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
05/12/23, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: However Rilliah, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 231 3286: Oky
05/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
05/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 231 3286: No Im not
05/12/23, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Alright Rilliah, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
05/12/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
05/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 231 3286: Yes I do
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
05/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
05/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
05/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 231 3286: No I don't have a question
05/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
05/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
05/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

The Rwandan genocide labelled the most notorious modern genocides began in 1994 lasting a total of a hundred days between the periods April and July. In that period it was estimated that nearly one million ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed as the international community and UN peacekeepers stood by. One would wonder why such powerful people with the right to stop all this stood by watching as people were being slayed to death not protecting them or was it all planned.
Although every country on the UN Security Council expressed outrage and horror once it was accepted and confirmed that there was a genocide occurring within Rwanda there was no major outreach or assistance from the international community. Daily reports of mass killings and rape were coming out of Rwanda and even though the Security Council met every day and discussed possible options it seems apparent that all of the permanent members were reluctant to intervene. The UN Security Council watched a genocide unfold in Rwanda.Sixteen years after following the Rwandan genocide, survivors and their families continued to present with considerable rates of PTSD and substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms.Despite that, the ruling Rwanda Patrolic Front Party continued to dominate the country with robust authority and tight control over civil society making this factor a social unrest which remains not solved.
In today's time, Rwanda has risen up a little bit and the goals it has set up for it's self and it's citizens will be archived. Although alot happened especially loosing so many people, Rwanda will be remembered as one of the biggest failures of the United Nations Security Council. The international community learned many lessons from the Rwandan Genocide and should feel a certain amount of guilt for not stopping it.

Life growing up at a simple family was nice. There isn't a family which is perfect in everything , all families have their different flows and mine was that. Being the only girl born with brothers meant all the chores were done by me from sweeping the whole house to cooking and even stubbing the burnt pots all fell on me. It was hard. At first I dropped a plate on purpose thinking my parents won't let me do chores alas I was wrong. Instead of being spared the dishes I was given a hard time and still continued doing them. My mother carried her note pad and noted when ever I broke a plate for me to replace when I'm older. My brothers never had any chores and being me as a kid always thought that they were my parents favorite. To get all those thoughts out from my mind I always to a stroll to the woods away from home and my siblings. The quietness of the  woods always made  me calm. If only people knew how forestry was important no one would cut down the trees, destroy vegetation and even kill animals I said in my mind little did I know I was going to make it my agenda to protect all fauna and flora. Despite having all these great ideas o how to protect the forest I mean who would dare listen to a child ? Growing up with a lot of negativity around me I thought it was all over for me and the love for flora and fauna until on day I stumbled on a quote that changed me "the win is coming never worry about when it is " reading about this fueled my drive to still continue to fight for forest life.
I stand looking at a mirror reflecting the struggles I've met and challenged but at the end conquered with the right mindset.
