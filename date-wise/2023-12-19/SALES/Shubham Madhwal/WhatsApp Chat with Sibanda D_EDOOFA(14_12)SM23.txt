14/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Sibanda D
 
I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer* 


We have received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Adrian*, I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the application form which you submitted and what I was able to understand from the same!
14/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Okay thank you
14/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I'm now online
14/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hello Sibanda, How are you?
14/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 440 8694: I'm good thanks and how are you
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
14/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes
14/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Adrian?*
14/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 440 8694: 1) My dream to pursue law. Going to university to do my tertiary education might prove to be a very challenging problem to my parents considering the hiking school fees and the drastically changing Zimbabwean economy. An Edoofa Scholarship is something that might definitely change my life forever since I would be granted an opportunity to pursue my dreams
14/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 440 8694: 2) from the discussion I had with Adrian I figured out that Edoofa is not just a scholarship program that offers and ensures accessible education for all despite nationality and race but it's definitely a life changing program that probably endows students with life changing skills since they even allow a platform whereby a student can learn while working as well. This not only builds a student academically but it also helps them be able to balance things in life given the scenario that they earn while they learn. It also helps them learn to depend on themselves hence destroying the dependency syndrome whereby students have to rely on their parents for everything which I believe is something that builds responsible and better human beings. I therefore believe Edoofa is not just any ordinary scholarship program but it's a life changing and extraordinary program
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Ok thank you
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes
14/12/23, 1:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*.

16/12/23, 11:30 am - Shubham Madhwal: Hello , Good morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 318 4969: Yes we can
16/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Good afternoon. Yes we can
16/12/23, 12:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 440 8694: Yes I'm very much confident

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

18/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 440 8694: The reason why I want to study abroad is that I want exposure to the world outside my native country. Also fees for tertiary education in my country are hiking while the employment rate is super low hence studying abroad would probably guarantee me a good job and above all a platform to fulfill my dreams
