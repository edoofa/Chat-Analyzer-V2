17/10/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

17/10/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 717 9272: No
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.

The course enables students for roles pertaining to Computer Applications and IT industry and helps a student develop programming skills, networking skills and learn application packages, programming languages and modern techniques of Information Technology. BCA Course is specially designed to prepare students for the IT field and also build a basic foundation for higher studies. Basics of Programming, Networking, World Wide Web, Data Structure, Data Analysis, Advanced basics of programming, database management, mathematics and software engineering are some of the topics that are covered in BCA course.

 *Career Prospects*

There are a variety of career options that are available for a BCA graduate in the IT industry. BCA degree holders can work in several sectors, some of which include Education, Multimedia, Financial Institutes, Government Departments, Security and Surveillance etc.

Candidates who don’t wish to go for a job after graduation, can also opt for higher studies like MCA degree i.e. Master of Computer Application. Another good option is a Master's Degree in Computer Management (MCM) or Master’s Degree in Information Management (MIM). For students inclined more towards the managerial aspects of an organization, MBA in Information Technology from a reputed B-School

*Job profiles for BCA graduates are:*

	*Programmers*
	*System Analyst*

17/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 717 9272: So you are saying with my combination I can't take software Engineering
17/10/23, 2:39 pm - Arshita: With this course Silas, you will be able to excel in the software and computer and will give you a wider career opportunities.
17/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Can I ask sir ??
17/10/23, 2:40 pm - Arshita: Sure, you can ask
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 717 9272: What about Network engineering
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Arshita: Silas with your aspirations in this field BCA, will be the best course for you.
17/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I'm not interested sir in this Program
17/10/23, 2:44 pm - Arshita: Let me discuss with our academic board regarding the same
17/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Okay sir waiting for your response
17/10/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: That is absolutely correct
17/10/23, 2:52 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
17/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 717 9272: So they is no chance for me in India
17/10/23, 3:02 pm - Arshita: Silas let me tell you that i was quite surprised with the statement, where you said that you don't want to pursue this course because it seems like you haven't researched about the program very well. 

There was a time in the IT sector when BCA graduates dominated over software engineering graduates and it continues to be a very demanding course with a lesser duration than software engineering. 

If you would have atleast taken some time to research about the curriculum of BCA you would have understood that it includes software engineering, networking, algorithm, and different programming languages from basics to the advance. 

Apart from this you will also get the opportunity to take the minors with the most the most modern technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, cyber security, etc. 

Now being your career counselor I suggested you the best possible program which aligns with your career and matches your requirements. 

This is a much better program than BSC computer science or BSC    IT.
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
17/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
17/10/23, 3:08 pm - Arshita: So do you want to pursue BCA?

17/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Because here in Zimbabwe it's hard to find Jobs of Computer applications

18/10/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
18/10/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
18/10/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
18/10/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
18/10/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
18/10/23, 9:31 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students

19/10/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 717 9272: Yeah
19/10/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
19/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 717 9272: No
19/10/23, 9:39 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/10/23, 9:39 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:39 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
19/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 717 9272: Is this the total cost per year
19/10/23, 9:40 am - Arshita: Yes
19/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 717 9272: No
19/10/23, 9:41 am - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
19/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 717 9272: No
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:43 am - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
19/10/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 717 9272: We want to know how reduced will it be per year
19/10/23, 9:47 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

24/10/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 717 9272: hello sir
24/10/23, 9:40 am - Austin: Good Morning Silas!
How are you today?
24/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 78 717 9272: im okay sir
24/10/23, 10:52 am - Austin: Good to hear that!
24/10/23, 10:53 am - Austin: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. Your intake is in August 2024
This cost can be further reduced by Silas through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
24/10/23, 10:53 am - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
24/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 717 9272: i understand it sir
24/10/23, 11:01 am - Austin: Being a parent, the question regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

Just to give a glimpse, with a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14 years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout the duration of their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While you Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, you will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

How are you today?
11/11/23, 6:44 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, we are really glad that Silas qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We look forward to him as a proud Edoofian fulfilling his career goals through this opportunity <This message was edited>
11/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 227 4762: We are fine Sir
11/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 227 4762: We greatly appreciate
11/11/23, 6:53 pm - Austin: Good to know!
11/11/23, 6:53 pm - Austin: Are you having any questions for me regarding the Acceptance Letter?
11/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Yes Sir
11/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 227 4762: The first one is , in the event that a deposit of $350 is made, then the child fails his academics here in Zimbabwe  is the money refundable.
11/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 227 4762: The second one is upon securing a place at a university a deposit of $500 is required, when is it actually required
11/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Maybe if you can explain further on how the $500 registration fee will be adjusted in the first year
11/11/23, 7:01 pm - Austin: Thank you for the question, may I ask, are you aware of the minimum Academic requirement to qualify for the Edoofa program?
11/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 227 4762: No Sir that one skipped me
11/11/23, 7:05 pm - Austin: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Silas achieving it
11/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Thank you so much Sir for the explanation
11/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 227 4762: I trust he will pass with maximum points
11/11/23, 7:09 pm - Austin: You are most welcome!
11/11/23, 7:10 pm - Austin: Even if Edoofians fail to meet the requirements, they have a positive path ahead. If a student qualifies as a deserving student for the Edoofa scholarship we believe that he/she has the calibre to meet the grades, so in case they fail to meet them, even then the eligibility will be valid, and students can write the exams again, gain minimum points and can join the intake. With the right needs and resources students will give their best to perform well.
11/11/23, 7:11 pm - Austin: The registration fee is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2000 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2000-600= $1400
11/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 227 4762: I understand now
11/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 227 4762: The other question is on semester break.
Are the students going to have semester break and travel back to Zimbabwe or they stay there for the three  year period of their course.
11/11/23, 7:35 pm - Austin: Usually, students look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.
11/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Thank you Sir
11/11/23, 8:22 pm - Austin: You are welcome
11/11/23, 8:22 pm - Austin: What else would you like to ask me please?
11/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 227 4762: I had those questions  .If something comes up will ask you Sir
11/11/23, 8:31 pm - Austin: That would be fine!
11/11/23, 8:31 pm - Austin: Did you manage to connect to any of our beneficiaries or their parents from your country to learn their experiences through the Edoofa Scholarship program?
11/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Not yet Sir. Been busy the whole day so I will ask them on Monday .
11/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 227 4762: I will connect with them on Monday Sir

11/11/23, 8:44 pm - Austin: This is well noted!

11/11/23, 9:02 pm - Austin: That would be fine!
11/11/23, 9:02 pm - Austin: Are you clear with the modes of enrollment fee payment mentioned on the Acceptance Letter?
11/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Yes.
I saw two options either through our Zimbabwean co-ordinator's account  or through Edoofa account.
So we  will use Zimbabwean account
11/11/23, 9:12 pm - Austin: This is well noted!

14/11/23, 8:33 pm - Austin: Please note that students will be guided through University sessions and will receive the Provisional Offer Letters before the results and once the results are out, they will be added to their profile
14/11/23, 8:33 pm - Austin: The registration fee is to be paid after receiving the Offer Letter. Our Team will be guiding you with the timeframe's and payment plans to reduce the pressure
14/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Thank you Sir

18/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Greetings. 
May you kindly assist.
On payment of registration fee  do I need to calculate 12.5% of 450
18/12/23, 12:52 pm - Austin: Good Day to you, @263772274762 
That is correct
18/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 227 4762: So does it mean I have to     pay   450+56 =506
18/12/23, 12:57 pm - Austin: May I know, which mode are you planning to use for the payment of registration fee?
18/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 717 9272: We are using Mr Jerera
18/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Using Mr Jerera's account
18/12/23, 1:10 pm - Austin: Yes, the calculation is correct
18/12/23, 1:10 pm - Austin: At  the same time, if you pay through Mr Rajan, the charges would be 7%
18/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Understood. Thank you
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - Austin: You are welcome!
18/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 227 4762: It's unfortunate that we need too travel and meet Mr Rajan... So it's better to deposit into Mr Jerera's account since we have the bank within our locality
