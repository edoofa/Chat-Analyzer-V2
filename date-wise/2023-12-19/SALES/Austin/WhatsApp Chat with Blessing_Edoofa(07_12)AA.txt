It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
08/12/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

08/12/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
08/12/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
08/12/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
08/12/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

08/12/23, 9:49 am - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

08/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 254 3604: I don't really know much but I've heard from some friends in India of the education system and some basics
08/12/23, 9:54 am - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
08/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 254 3604: Well as I have analysed the facts about studying in India I've realized that India has Universities which provide education of the highest level and as you have said the Edoofian are there to make sure people are provided with the right education to accomplish thier career aspiration .So I believe an opportunity to study in India is what can help me to achieve my career aspirations

08/12/23, 10:05 am - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
08/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 254 3604: I'm not familiar with it
08/12/23, 10:09 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 10:10 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:10 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
08/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 254 3604: I am not from a well up family but I think my parents can do thier level best
08/12/23, 10:18 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
08/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 254 3604: How is it done?
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value.

08/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
08/12/23, 10:21 am - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships.

08/12/23, 10:44 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/12/23, 10:54 am - +27 73 968 1511: We would love him to study abroad.  You may proceed
08/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 254 3604: They seem to be interested
08/12/23, 10:57 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
08/12/23, 11:00 am - +27 63 010 2995: No may you please explain
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
08/12/23, 11:27 am - +27 63 010 2995: We need more time to read and understand
08/12/23, 11:28 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
08/12/23, 11:28 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 11:47 am - +27 73 968 1511: Yes he wll benefit
08/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
08/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
08/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
08/12/23, 11:53 am - +27 73 968 1511: True that
08/12/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
08/12/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/12/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
08/12/23, 12:04 pm - +27 73 968 1511: Edoofa is it the bursary provider  or consultant
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - Arshita: Neither of them, Edoofa is an educational organization providing 50-100 % scholarships on tuition and even Accommodation for selected students. We are a higher education concierge focussing on affordability in education and employability of our Edoofians
08/12/23, 12:08 pm - +27 73 968 1511: Noted
08/12/23, 12:19 pm - +27 63 010 2995: Yes you may
08/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
08/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/12/23, 12:40 pm - +27 63 010 2995: May l ask when are you supposed to do the payment since Blessing still has one more year to finish  his  A level studies
08/12/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: The payment will be done once she is selected for the program after the interview.
08/12/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
09/12/23, 10:59 am - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
09/12/23, 10:59 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
09/12/23, 10:59 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
09/12/23, 11:06 am - +27 63 010 2995: Morning yes we are
09/12/23, 11:37 am - +27 73 968 1511: My bad
09/12/23, 1:09 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

Are you ready for the same?
10/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 254 3604: yes we are ready

I hope you are doing well
10/12/23, 4:45 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
10/12/23, 4:50 pm - +27 73 968 1511: Good day. We need money breakdown of all the stages
10/12/23, 4:57 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mr Courage!
Sure, let me help you with the same
10/12/23, 4:57 pm - Austin: *Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. Now, based on the scholarship and performance of your child this cost can be less than $2000 as well.

This cost can be further reduced by Blessing through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program
10/12/23, 4:58 pm - Austin: *Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
10/12/23, 4:59 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $1800 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $1800-600= $1200

The cost of transportation is catered by a student's family

10/12/23, 5:13 pm - +27 73 968 1511: ??
10/12/23, 5:15 pm - Austin: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.

15/12/23, 2:55 pm - +27 63 010 2995: 100% correct our fisrt born son is there already
17/12/23, 12:03 pm - +27 63 010 2995: Good day , l have a question please explain more about the registration fee wich is $500_ $1000 when is it payable  so that we plan wisely
18/12/23, 8:13 am - Austin: Good Morning to you all! 
How are you today?
18/12/23, 8:14 am - Austin: The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2000-600= $1400
18/12/23, 8:39 am - +27 63 010 2995: Morning thank you for response . If l may ask how long does it it to receive  offer letter from University
18/12/23, 8:54 am - Austin: For all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration of 20 months in the following manner

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 13 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country. 

*2. Parents' Communication with the Admission's Team:* Having ample time at hand benefits not only the student but also allows parents to better plan their child's international education journey. To leverage this advantage, you will engage with the admissions team immediately after completing your enrollment process, preparing for your child's academic journey in the 2025 intake. Admission Officers will assist you in proper financial planning for the 25 academic year. This means it's the right time to start saving for your child's annual fees after scholarship, and if you face any challenges, they can be addressed in advance. Motive of financial planning would be to ensure that all the parents are in a much better position in terms of finances by August 2024, once financial planning is completed till August 2024, you'll start receiving Offer Letters from the Universities around September/October 2024. This gives you the advantage of selecting the University of your choice. This process offers convenience to parents as the Admission Officers assist in financial preparation, alleviating any burdens towards the end.

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
18/12/23, 9:23 am - +27 63 010 2995: Ok well understood , thank you!!!
18/12/23, 9:38 am - Austin: You are welcome, are you having other questions for me?
18/12/23, 10:23 am - +27 63 010 2995: No questions for now thank you!!!!
18/12/23, 10:43 am - Austin: You are welcome, are you clear with the modes of enrollment fee payment?
