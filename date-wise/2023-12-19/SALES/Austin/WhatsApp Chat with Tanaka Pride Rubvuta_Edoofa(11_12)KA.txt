11/12/23, 1:32 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 723 5361: Thank you sir. I am confident that i will perfom better.
11/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
May I know with your interests towards Software Engineering, why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
11/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 723 5361: I have interests in Software Engineering due to high demand in Software Engineers and i have a good understanding towards computer languages that is VB, JavaScript and Python.
I didn't opt for Physics at A level because at ordinary level I didn't attain a better mark .
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: Alright Tanka, I do understand
Let me tell you that since you are not having Physics at A level, you are not eligible for Software Engineering
At the same time, looking at your interest towards this field, you are eligible for 

*Bachelor of Computer Application*

11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 723 5361: In the next five years i see myself giving  opportunities to the less privileged as i have been given by Edoofa.
Being an Edoofian would give me opportunities to learn more about Computer Science through the resources that have been put in front.
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 723 5361: I have not researched on that subject
11/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
11/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 723 5361: I will do my research
11/12/23, 2:04 pm - Kunal: You can go through this, Tanaka
11/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 723 5361: I have gone through the prices and have fully understand them
11/12/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
11/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
11/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 723 5361: This is a great program and gives an insight to how beneficial the Edoofian scholarships are.
11/12/23, 2:22 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 723 5361: This both benefit the student and family to thrive under harsh conditions so much that a student will have a fresh mind while studying
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Kunal: That is right
Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 723 5361: 1. This gave an insight to how well u mentor your children through various stages even when there is no acceptance yet.
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education,services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 723 5361: As i have stated before my parents and other two siblings
11/12/23, 2:35 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 723 5361: My family are very delighted for me to get a lifetime opportunity like this and they fully embrace me learning abroad since it has vast career opportunities.
11/12/23, 2:38 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
11/12/23, 2:38 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 723 5361: 1. Use of transcript and basic information about myself
2. Visa
3. Academic reference 
4. Passport copy
5. Financial proof
6. Profiency on English language
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 723 5361: This helps the low income households so much that everyone can have an opportunity
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Kunal: That is right
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 723 5361: This is great to know
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 723 5361: Stage 2
11/12/23, 2:52 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 723 5361: Yes we can proceey
11/12/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
11/12/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.


I hope you are clear with the process.

12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Kunal: Tanaka, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 723 5361: 1. I will be studying Bachelor of Computer Application through Efoofa program.
2. I will be studying in India through the Edoofa program.
3.The average of studies in India without Edoofa is around 6000 to 8000.
4. If i am found eligible i will be paying roughly around  $2200 and roughly $1 200 if i get Earn While You Learn Program.
5. The enrollment gee of the Edoofa program is $350 which is paid in 7 days 
6. My understanding on Earn While You Learn Program is that you will be paid around $100 monthly which is then added to your school fees which is $2200 which means that around $1200 remains in my school fees and is left for my parents for them to come up with the rest of the fee.
7. Yes the information is clearly interpreted.
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Kunal: 4. The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000

Even though, the cost of education through the Edoofa Scholarship ranges from $2000-$3000 per annum, based on your performance in the eligibility check stage, you can be considered for a higher quantum of scholarship which can reduce the costs even below $2000 inclusive of tuition and living.
