07/12/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child, aren't you?*
07/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 307 9320: This message was deleted
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
07/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: Can you please share more about Emily, what kind of child she is , her qualifications and career aspirations?
07/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 307 9320: Yes thanks very much mine is at Reformed church Gutu
07/12/23, 1:02 pm - Arshita: Good to know that!
07/12/23, 1:02 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
07/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 307 9320: Emily is a well behaved child, currently doing her lower 6 after passing her O level exam she is doing science sublects
07/12/23, 1:18 pm - Arshita: That is good to know!
07/12/23, 1:18 pm - Arshita: May I know what are her career aspirations?
07/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 307 9320: She intend to be a electrical software engineer, or geo partial engineer
07/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: That is well noted. 

To take her evaluation forward can you please share her term results of form 5?
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 307 9320: Mathematics 60, geography 55, computers 70, agriculture 80
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: Noted
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about her achieving it.
07/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 307 9320: Off course very confident
07/12/23, 1:53 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in Emily studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 307 9320: Yes l have my cousin who was studying in your country an dentist and finished last year but one
07/12/23, 1:57 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
07/12/23, 1:57 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:57 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
07/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 307 9320: OK I'm done
07/12/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: May I know with her interest in engineering why didn't she opt for science in A level?
07/12/23, 2:32 pm - Arshita: I am waiting for your response. 

There are a lot of applications in the waiting list from different schools of Zimbabwe. Thus I want you to be very active in these sessions so that you don't miss it. 

Let me know if there is any challenge.
07/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 307 9320: It was her inspiration to become an engineer or Dr one day then we kept supporting till this day.
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 307 9320: And there are know challenges
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Arshita: I understand that!
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - Arshita: Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - Arshita: Since she does not have science , she is not eligible for medical or engineering. 

At the same time may I know if she has any alternate career aspirations.
07/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Computer science engineering
07/12/23, 2:58 pm - Arshita: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests and passion, you are eligible to pursue

07/12/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
07/12/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
07/12/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
07/12/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
07/12/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
07/12/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
07/12/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

07/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Waal
07/12/23, 3:48 pm - Arshita: By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
07/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 304 7944: No I am not familiar with any cost yet to find out
07/12/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to you?
07/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Yes it is affordable
07/12/23, 4:11 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
07/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 304 7944: This is good
07/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Kindly elaborate
07/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 304 7944: How it is done
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think Emily will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
07/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Yes yes Emily benefit from Earn While You Learn Program
07/12/23, 4:25 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

07/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Yes
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
07/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 304 7944: 2
07/12/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

07/12/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Ok
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
07/12/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 307 9320: 1
07/12/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: All these are needed
07/12/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
07/12/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/12/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
07/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Yes yes you can
07/12/23, 6:35 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
07/12/23, 6:35 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 7:35 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *8:30 am CAT on Friday(08/12/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
07/12/23, 7:35 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 8:35 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*There is always light. If only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
08/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 304 7944: Good morning
08/12/23, 10:08 am - Arshita: Greetings!
08/12/23, 10:08 am - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
08/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 304 7944: Yes I did but I have a que
08/12/23, 10:32 am - Arshita: Sure
08/12/23, 11:04 am - Arshita: I am waiting for your response
08/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 304 7944: When is this payment excepted
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: Once Emily is selected for the program and she gets her acceptance letter
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Great
08/12/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenge with the schedule. 

Meanwhile you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

08/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: Thank you for waiting. 

Are we good to continue?
08/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Yes let's countinue
08/12/23, 2:15 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
08/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 304 7944: I think we have discussed up to stage 5
08/12/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: No, we have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
08/12/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/12/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
08/12/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
08/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 304 7944: Please explain more on stage 5
08/12/23, 3:19 pm - Arshita: Please go through it

08/12/23, 4:07 pm - Arshita: Noted.
08/12/23, 4:34 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

We hosted counselling sessions for *Chiredzi High School under Mr Zwada, the school Head from which 3 Edoofians are studying in India now including the children of two teachers*, Tungwane High is our associate school with the child of the Head studying in India. We are associated with Zaka High under Mr Museba who took part at our Harare Education Summit as well and have two former students of St Anthony's here in India(with more than 40 qualifiers).

09/12/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 304 7944: 7.The EWYL program is way of earning scholarship credits for the learner. It is whereby the learner, based on her performance, attains  work experience through live online projects. It help the learner to develop skills to tackle the digital workspace environment. In my on understanding this is way of making sure that whatever that you are learning is not only theoretical but also become practical. This is a good  virtue for for every learner as it ensures that the learners do not only dream but they given a chance to make a reality out of those dreams but working hard
