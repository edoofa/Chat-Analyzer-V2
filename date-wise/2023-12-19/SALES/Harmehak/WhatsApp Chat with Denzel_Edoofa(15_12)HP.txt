18/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ummm actually all I know is that the Edoofa scholarship is a scholarship program that enrols many students and also Indian based
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Denzel, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

18/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Indeed

18/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes exactly I would love to join your programme and also reduce the financial burden on my mom

18/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Denzel, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
18/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Thank you
18/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Well Denzil, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
18/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yaaah I believe it's very beneficial and also a platform for me to get out there and learn new things
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Denzel?
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes 100 percent prepared
18/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
18/12/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh yes I told my mother way before the closure of schools and she was fine with it and others too are in support of the idea but financially that could be challenging that's why she urged me to look for a scholarship
18/12/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, can you please elaborate regarding the financial aspect, Denzel?
18/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 315 9928: So am actually saying that I really like studying abroad but I believe the total cost of Education can be expensive that's why am looking for a scholarship to lessen the burden
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I do understand Denzel!

So is your mother willing to support you financially along with the scholarship?
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yaaah I believe so
18/12/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
18/12/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
18/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh okay I do understand.... Yaaah don't wry mam I won't let you down
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Denzel!
18/12/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law or Human resource management?
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
18/12/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh am sorry mam due to power cuts here my battery had drained but I appreciate talking to you talk tomorrow then
18/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 315 9928: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Oooh actually I was influenced by movies and series like suits plus the Indian movies Jolly LLB and The crossroads another indian soap so from then I've developed the interest in law..
18/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Then on human resource management I just love it and also value the welfare of others so it can be another practical platform for me to showcase these things...
