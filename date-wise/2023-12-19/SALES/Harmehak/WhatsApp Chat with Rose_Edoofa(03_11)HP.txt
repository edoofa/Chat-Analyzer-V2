02/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Rose kafunda
03/11/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

03/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/11/23, 12:18 pm - +260 97 8799693: Okay..

04/11/23, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
04/11/23, 9:45 am - +260 97 8799693: Edoofa is a program that makes learning affordable
04/11/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 8799693: From my own perspective edoofa makes learning affordable by reducing the tuition fee from 50_100
04/11/23, 9:50 am - +260 97 8799693: Where by learners can only pay small amounts of money
04/11/23, 9:50 am - +260 97 8799693: It's like a helping hand which helps you pay half the amount of money
04/11/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Very well!

What else did you learn about the program and finances involved?
04/11/23, 10:00 am - +260 97 8799693: That's all
04/11/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Alright,

Didn't you learn more about the finances involved Rose?
04/11/23, 10:12 am - +260 97 8799693: I didn't understand
04/11/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: In simple words Rose, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/11/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Did you understand the same?
04/11/23, 10:24 am - +260 97 8799693: Oh okay I now understand
