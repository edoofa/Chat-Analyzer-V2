I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Shingirirai College charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
11/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Yes thats what l believe
11/12/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright, and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?

11/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 105 2450: They are supportive,l have already told them on the family gathering last week
11/12/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Well that's good
11/12/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I promise to have 14points
11/12/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit

11/12/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
11/12/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

12/12/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Makanaka, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Actually,l heard that edoofa scholarships are only for abroad ,if there were also edoofa schoolarships in African universities ,l will go there
12/12/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: So isn't international education a priority for you, Makanaka?
12/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Its a priority Ms
12/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 105 2450: I forget to ask do you have universities in Africa
12/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Education abroad is more advance than in Africa ,plus its a peaceful place for education thre will be no disturbances
12/12/23, 4:10 pm - Harmehak: You see, Makanaka, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
12/12/23, 4:11 pm - Harmehak: No please, we offer scholarship only to those who wish to study in India, Makanaka.
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok l now understand it
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Education abroad is more advance than in Africa ,plus its a peaceful place for education thre will be no disturbances
12/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Noted,okay okay l now get it
12/12/23, 4:36 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, however I am glad you are making efforts for a promising future.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

15/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Makanaka.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 105 2450: No, l am not familiar
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok l get it, so how much per semester
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Makanaka, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: There are two semesters a year please.
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
15/12/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
15/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
15/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Its great
16/12/23, 10:07 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 105 2450: Morning
16/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Makanaka?

Do ensure active participation.
16/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 105 2450: Edooofa is great ,it really helps .Its an advantage to Africans like me
16/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 105 2450: So have you decided the day we will end this session
16/12/23, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Today itself, Makanaka.
16/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: You see, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 105 2450: Yes l agreee
16/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 105 2450: Ok ok
16/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 105 2450: What follows,after this
16/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Makanaka?
16/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: We are in the Counseling session currently discussing the process, Makanaka?
16/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
16/12/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Yes
16/12/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 105 2450: Ok
18/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 105 2450: Hello
18/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 105 2450: Okay l get it
18/12/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read and understand, Makanaka?
18/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 105 2450: So they pay high money or its little money
18/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
18/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 105 2450: Yes
18/12/23, 10:55 am - Harmehak: Please.
18/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 105 2450: I want to ask these earning programs do they really pay high money
18/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better understanding?
18/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 105 2450: Yes l now have a better understanding
18/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Wonderful
18/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
