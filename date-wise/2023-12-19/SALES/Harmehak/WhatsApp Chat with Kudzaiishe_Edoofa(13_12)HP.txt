15/12/23, 9:59 am - Harmehak: I understand please
15/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 667 7333: Olk
15/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 432 5245: Ok
15/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 667 7333: Yes I am confident about that
15/12/23, 10:04 am - +27 84 579 6461: Yes we are
15/12/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful.

15/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 667 7333: You mean a picture of the results
15/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 667 7333: As a young boy who lives in a poverty stricken nation I wish to up lift the under privileged and try by  all means  to  people to live their acquired standerd
15/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 667 7333: An dto also make people have access to resources equally
15/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: It's great to know of your kind thoughts and your aspirations to do well, Kudzaiishe.

So did you ever happen to research about your desired field?
15/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 667 7333: Yes
15/12/23, 10:45 am - Harmehak: That's good,

What all did you learn from your research, Kudzaiishe?
15/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 667 7333: The main  aspect of being a social worker is assisting different communities and different kinds of people for them to meet their basic livelihood standards and also giving yourself to the people in the provision of their assistance
15/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 667 7333: Also helping them through problems for instance unemployment divorce poverty etc
15/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: That's surely well thought off, Kudzaiishe.

So what's your take on pursuing Law instead?

Don't you believe your aspirations resonate more with Law?
15/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 667 7333: Law is a good program but the the fact is that am not all that agumantative hence applying for Social Work
15/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

I can understand.
15/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
15/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
15/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
15/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 667 7333: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 667 7333: This message was deleted
15/12/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Yes please?
15/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 667 7333: So you mean that those who do social Work has the same opportunities as those doing Sociology?
15/12/23, 11:20 am - Harmehak: Yes please, Kudzaiishe.

As here in India the students who wish to work in the social sector or Social work,

They ideally pursue Law or Bachelors in Sociology please.
15/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 667 7333: So I willi will perdue law then
15/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 667 7333: Persue
15/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Alright, and what inclined you towards Law, Kudzaiishe?
15/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 667 7333: The economic situation and my desire to help others
15/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Alright please, 

I can understand, which is why I initially asked your thorough on pursuing Law.

So let me brief you about your desired course, Kudzaiishe.

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

15/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs and Mr Matete.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 667 7333: Does it provide job vacancies for students abroad
15/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
15/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 432 5245: This is good news which it is advantageous to pursue education with you
15/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
15/12/23, 12:58 pm - Harmehak: So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/12/23, 12:59 pm - +27 84 579 6461: No tell us
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 1:06 pm - +27 84 579 6461: So you mean all are getting Earn while you learn programme?
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Okey
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
15/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
15/12/23, 1:10 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Okey its clear
15/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Did you happen to read regarding the opportunity and costs for 90-100% scholarship?
15/12/23, 1:13 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Yes you said 1200 to 1800
15/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
15/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Gelly, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
15/12/23, 1:19 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Yes you right my friend 's daughter is doing social worker she is paying a lot of money
15/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Mrs Gelly!
15/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, please?
15/12/23, 1:20 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Yes
15/12/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
15/12/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/12/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/12/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

15/12/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: We provide scholarship on tuition fee please.
15/12/23, 1:23 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Okey
15/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: The fee after the scholarship would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition, Basic University Expenses like Wifi, Gym, Laundry, Library.
15/12/23, 1:23 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Okey
15/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: You can learn more about the Earn While You Learn Program from the shared resources please.
15/12/23, 1:24 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Okey
15/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: So now do you have any queries please? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 1:49 pm - +27 84 579 6461: No i don't have thankx Ms Hrmehak
15/12/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +27 84 579 6461: Okey
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on affordability so far, Mrs Gelly?
15/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 432 5245: Sorry Ms Harmehak  to draw you back would you please explain how a student earns these scholarship credits
15/12/23, 1:59 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 432 5245: This sounds good and motivating Mam
15/12/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please
15/12/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Can you please address the same?
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 432 5245: Ok Ms Harmehak I get you

15/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 432 5245: Very true Ms Harmehak am being enlightened now
15/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
15/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 432 5245: Am  ready
15/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Mr Charles, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
15/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 432 5245: $1500 to $ 2500
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Mrs and Mr Matete, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 432 5245: It's true
15/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
15/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 432 5245: Ok
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 432 5245: Sure
15/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
15/12/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

15/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
