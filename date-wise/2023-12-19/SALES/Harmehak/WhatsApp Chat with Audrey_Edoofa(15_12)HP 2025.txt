*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Audrey Mupfeki. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.

16/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: So now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 249 3011: "Thank you for the information about the scholarship. I'm really interested in applying, and I appreciate the background information you shared. It's helpful to know more about the scholarship and how it works."
16/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome Audrey
16/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 10:37 am - +267 74 612 137: This is really good to have such a good scholarship like this so what are conditions of the scholarship like how do apply how do you pay how much is it
16/12/23, 10:38 am - +27 69 391 6457: Yes we need to know the cost how does this work
16/12/23, 10:38 am - +267 74 612 137: That is true
16/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: We would be discussing the entire details in our session today.
16/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Sure please.
16/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 249 3011: "You're absolutely right. It's important to me to be able to take responsibility for my education and not be a burden on my parents. That's why I'm researching scholarships and financial aid options to make sure I can afford the school I want to attend."
16/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Audrey, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Dangamvura high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?
16/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Taurai and Mrs Grace, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
16/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 249 3011: My name is Audrey, and I'm a student who's currently in high school. My school is Dangamvura High, it charges $100 USD per term and I'm also the Headgirl of my school.l just got elected without even looking forward to it and this helped me to be even more confident because  of the time which l will be leading a group of my fellow colleagues.I'm interested in studying social work because I've always been fascinated by helping people who are in need and I also love sharing ideas and cancelling those people with personal issues. I'm a hard worker and I love to learn new things, but sometimes I struggle with procrastination. In my free time, I like to read, play netball, and go for long walks. I'm a person who has compassion, empathy and patience and most importantly I love being myself and I too optimistic . So l make sure that everything l do help me to go somewhere better
16/12/23, 10:52 am - +27 69 391 6457: Okay. My highest qualification is secondary level which is why l love Audrey to obtain higher than that.We are a small family (christian)me ,my husband and our three kids both in school.lm a caregiver by profession lm the only one working for the moment that's why l need to know if we can manage this program
16/12/23, 11:09 am - +267 74 612 137: My highest qualification is form 4  as the father of Audrey i really want her to go further with her education as i am not working because of my health only my wife she is the one who is taking care of us so its not easy for her alone  to take  care of the family
16/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Audrey and you Mrs and Mr Mupfeki, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
16/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: It's great to know of your skills, Audrey.
16/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your support to the family, Mrs Grace.
16/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I can understand please, I hope you feel better, Mr Taurai.
16/12/23, 11:32 am - +27 69 391 6457: Thank you
16/12/23, 11:33 am - +267 74 612 137: Thanks very much
16/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 249 3011: Wow that's so thoughtful of you to say
16/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.
16/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Audrey, may I know more about your siblings please?
16/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 249 3011: Of course I would love to tell you more about my siblings.
Firstly Aubrey and Tanyaradzwa are my other halfs because I really care about them. If anything bad happens to them my heart will sank so they're indeed my other halfs. Aubrey is aged 13 and he will be in form one next year. As for Tanyaradzwa she the youngest and she is too much talkative and she's also light hearted 🤦🏾‍♀️. She will be in grade one next year, still at primary level.
Sometimes we hang out together., I really appreciate having siblings like them although sometimes they make me crazy. We always share our troubles to each other
And look after one another... The worst part is I'm not always with my siblings because I will be away for school. However when I'm around everything will be complete they always respect me as their sister and I love guiding them the right path to be successful in future
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Well expressed Audrey, 

It's a pleasure to know about your siblings, I can see you are really fond of them.
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Well Audrey, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
16/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 249 3011: studying abroad can be a life-changing experience in many ways. First, it can expose me to new cultures and ways of thinking, which can help me become more open-minded and culturally aware. Second, it can give me the opportunity to learn new languages and develop new skills. Finally, it can give me the chance to meet new people from all over the world and create lasting friendships. So overall, I believe that studying abroad can be a transformative experience that can positively impact my life...
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: That's well put across, Audrey,

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
16/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Absolutely,  mental preparedness is a key part of making the most of an experience abroad. Moving to a new country can be challenging, both emotionally and culturally. It's important to prepare myself mentally for the challenges l may face, like homesickness and culture shock. So I must say I'm prepared for a life abroad!
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So Mrs and Mr Mupfeki could you please share, if you as parents are willing to support her higher education abroad mentally and financially?
16/12/23, 12:44 pm - +27 69 391 6457: Yes we can say we're much willing to support our daughter mentally and financially for the betterment of her future
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - +27 69 391 6457: I believe Audrey can obtain this
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I admire your trust please.
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Audrey, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Social work ?
16/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I can obtain more than these points 😊
16/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 249 3011: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit!
16/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Literature, History and Fares or Divinity that's my A level combination
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 249 3011: For me, there are a few things that motivate me to do social work. First, I believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential, and I want to help make that possible. Second, I'm passionate about making a positive impact on the world and improving people's lives. Finally, I find it very rewarding to see the results of my work and the impact it has on others. So overall, I'm motivated by a desire to help others and make a difference in the world
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please
16/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: That's surely well thought off, Audrey!

However, don't you believe Law or Psychology are two other departments that shall greatly align with your aspirations?
16/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 249 3011: That's a really interesting question, and I can definitely see how law and psychology could align with my aspirations. In fact, both of these fields often overlap with social work. In law, for example, there are many opportunities to help people and make a difference in their lives. And in psychology, there are many opportunities to understand and improve the human condition. I think all three of these fields are related and have the potential to make a positive impact on the world. What do you think?
16/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct and well put across,

So now that you are aware how Law and Psychology are fields that can help you flourish equally!

May I know which field out of the three are you most inclined towards?
16/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Social work
16/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I feel like it's the field that allows for the most direct and meaningful impact on people's lives. It also allows for the greatest degree of flexibility, which I really appreciate.
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I understand and appreciate, Audrey.
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Thank you Ms Harmehak
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
16/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 249 3011: And I can see how sociology would be a good alternative for students who are interested in the field of social work. It seems like a very versatile and practical course, and it's great that students can still pursue careers in social work even if they don't have a degree in it. Thanks for sharing all of this with me! I really appreciate the insight
 Please now tell me if I do sociology does that mean I can still get involved in social working
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

Let me brief you about Bachelors in Sociology
16/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I'm all ears

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
16/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Noted
18/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 249 3011: Hey good morning people

18/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue Bachelors in Sociology, Audrey?
18/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 249 3011: Yes I really do as l found out that sociology is also consisted with social working too
18/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Very correct
18/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Alright Audrey, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 249 3011: If I had a degree in sociology, I might see myself working in a field like social research or social policy. I might be able to use my skills to help people and make a difference in the world. And with the Edoofa program, I might be able to learn even more and develop my skills further. It could open up new opportunities for me and allow me to achieve even more than I could without the program... this will be possible by the learn while you earn
18/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: That is really great Audrey, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 10:30 am - +27 69 391 6457: Good morning, sorry today lm at work l might be busy during this discussion
18/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 249 3011: Well, I want to study abroad because It can be a great way to experience new cultures, meet new people, and gain new perspectives on the world. It can also be a way to improve language skills and gain new experiences that can be valuable in the future... Lastly I just love how Edoofa works with the students and that strigured me to study abroad
18/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: That's alright please,

You can follow once you are able to Mrs Grace.
18/12/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: That is wonderful Audrey, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
18/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 249 3011: Thank you

18/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 249 3011: Those are excellent points! It's clear that the Edoofa scholarship program has chosen India as its focus because of the country's strong educational infrastructure, renowned institutions, and quality of education. I'm impressed. I now have a deep understanding of the advantages of studying in India..
18/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Audrey.


So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 249 3011: No they're not familiar with that
18/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Wow, that's really impressive! So, not only does Edoofa reduce the cost of education for selected students, it also gives them the opportunity to further reduce their costs by earning money while they learn. It seems like a win-win situation for everyone involved. That means l can  get access to high-quality education at a reduced cost, and also have the opportunity to gain valuable work experience while they study. That's really innovative! Can you tell me more about the Earn While You Learn program? What kinds of jobs are available to students?
18/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Did you learn regarding the applications from here please?
18/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, we would discuss the entire details regarding the Earn While You Learn Program!
18/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I just did almost forgot that
18/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I'm all ears
18/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 249 3011: That's a very innovative approach to making higher education more affordable! It's clear that the Earn While You Learn program gives students a real-world experience that they can use to make their education more affordable, while also gaining valuable work experience. And the fact that the credits are earned based on a student's performance is a great way to encourage students to work hard and do their best. Do all students have the opportunity to participate in the EWYL program, or is it limited to certain majors or programs?
18/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Every student gets the opportunity to be a part of the Earn While You Learn Program and the best part is you start from Zimbabwe itself.
18/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 249 3011: That's fantastic! So, students don't even need to leave their home country to begin earning scholarship credits through the EWYL program. That's a great way to make higher education more accessible to students from all backgrounds.  Are the projects assigned to students related to their field of study, or are they more general?
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Noted
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

You would be alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist you with your field and schedule as per your course itself.
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: Very correct Audrey!

Are students are our first priority.
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 249 3011: It's clear that Edoofa is truly dedicated to its students and to helping them achieve their goals.
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the shared resources too?
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 249 3011: It's still downloading
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I'm super ready
18/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Yes its amazing more than l had dared to hope
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 249 3011: we can see that applying to 5 universities would cost between $1,500 and $2,250. However, it's important to keep in mind that this is just an estimate. The exact cost will depend on the specific universities that the student applies to, as well as any application fees or other associated costs. It's possible that the total cost could be higher or lower than this estimate. But it's certainly a significant amount of money, and it's important for students to be aware of the costs involved in applying to universities.
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 249 3011: That's a really important point! The application process for universities can be very expensive, and there is no guarantee of admission or financial aid. This can create a lot of stress for us students, as we often unsure of how to navigate the process and worried about the costs involved. It's a lot of pressure, and it can be hard for students to know how to make the best decisions for their future. Do you think the process could be made easier or more affordable for students?
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Absolutely! Edoofa's guarantee program takes away a lot of the uncertainty and stress that comes with the university application process. Oh thank you I'm relieved.It's also great that the enrollment fee includes help with creating a statement of purpose and recommendation letter, as well as visa assistance. This takes a lot of the pressure off us students and allows us to focus on our studies and future goals. The Earn While You Learn Program is also an amazing opportunity for us students to gain valuable work experience and earn money while we're studying. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved!
18/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
18/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Wow, that's a fantastic offer! Given the challenges that the pandemic has created for everyone, this is a really kind gesture by the Edoofa program. It's clear that the program is committed to supporting students and making sure that they have the best possible chance of success. So am l supposed to pay the program fee separately or
18/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: It's a one time fee payment for these benefits please.
18/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 249 3011: This is a really innovative way of doing things! By allowing students to earn credits while they're still in school, the Edoofa program is giving us a head start on our future. It's great that the program is helping  us students to be prepared for the next stage of our lives, while also reducing our costs.
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Edoofa is the best
No questions it's just straight forward
18/12/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
18/12/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, currently you are an Lower 6 student?
18/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Next year l will an upper six
18/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please
18/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 249 3011: So when am I going to pay the enrollment fee ?
18/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 249 3011: My results will be out in 2025
18/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
18/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Audrey_Edoofa(15/12)HP" to "Audrey_Edoofa(15/12)HP 2025"
18/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
18/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
18/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 249 3011: It's crystal clear now
18/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 249 3011: The focus on financial planning is particularly interesting - it's clear that Edoofa understands that the cost of education is a major concern for many students and their families.
18/12/23, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

18/12/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 249 3011: It's great that the Edoofa program has a dedicated team to help with the visa application process. This can be a complex and confusing process, so having a team that is specifically trained to help with this is really beneficial. How does the visa assistance team work with students to ensure that they are prepared for the application process? Do they offer any resources or guidance on what to expect?
18/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Well, noted
18/12/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: There would be a visa officer alloted to you to assist you with that
18/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: They guide you with the entire process.
18/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Okay l appreciate
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

18/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I will definitely do that
18/12/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/12/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

18/12/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Dear Audrey,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “19-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
18/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak for your precious time I really appreciate
18/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I will definitely do my best 🙏
18/12/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: I sincerely appreciate your efforts, Audrey
18/12/23, 4:59 pm - +27 69 391 6457: Thank you so much for the explanation, sorry I was not able to participate today but everything is clear.
18/12/23, 5:00 pm - +27 69 391 6457: Thank again for Ms Ruth conduct will definitely talk to her🙏🏼
18/12/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please and I understand
18/12/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 5:58 pm - +27 69 391 6457: I just got a question,ls the EWYL done after paying $350 also can Audrey start the program in 2024 while waiting for August 2025?
18/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: The EWYL program start after initial installment please.
18/12/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
18/12/23, 6:02 pm - +27 69 391 6457: Okay thank you
18/12/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome please
