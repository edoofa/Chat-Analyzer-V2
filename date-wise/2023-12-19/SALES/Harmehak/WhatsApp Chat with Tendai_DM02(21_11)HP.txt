21/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Sandra, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to know Tendai better as a student!

How she is at school, her interests and hobbies along with what exactly would she like to pursue for her higher education.
21/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Tendai is a quiet hard working girl who has dreams of doing medicine. She wants to be a Eurology surgeon to be specific.
21/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Her passion for being a Doctor has always been there since her childhood but the specialisation to the Euro route was brought about by mum's sickness as she suffered from cancer for close to 10years which she finally succumbed to so she would always say if only i had finished school
21/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She is currently at Daramombe doing her A levels
21/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 340 7203: For Ordinary level she was at St Mary's Magdalene were she attained 9 passes
21/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She is currently doing Maths, Chemistry and Biology
21/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 340 7203: She likes music and travelling
21/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
21/11/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
21/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Thank you for the considerations...the help will indeed go a long way.
21/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I would like to express my grief to hear the same please.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Surely the students have to aim higher and give their best short and not focus on the minimum qualifying criteria.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: I can see how that must have affected you all and her which eventually drove her to pursue a career in medical sector.
21/11/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Very correct please.
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians.
21/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:00 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: Good morning.
I am well thank you.
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: I hope you are well too
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 340 7203: Yes we can start
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Yes please, thank you
22/11/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: You happened to mention her subjects, 

However I can see she didn't pursue Physics in her A level, may I know the reason behind the same please?
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 340 7203: Two factors were at play, When we explained to the school on what she wanted to do ultimately (medicine) they advised us on a combination to take which was Maths, Chemistry and Physics 2) She did not have the result that she expectedics, she had a C at O level which is normally a range of between 51 to 59% pass so she felt she did not do so well as compared to Chemistry and was afraid that it may be more difficult for her to pass the Physics at A. level.
22/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 340 7203: sorry Maths, Chemistry and Biology there on the advise from the school.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please, I do understand.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 340 7203: Ooh owkay, so it means one has to do all the three at Alevel and 2 or less.
Like in this case she is doing Chemistry and Biology only of the mandatory subjects.
22/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 340 7203: How would we go about it in her case, is there room to use O level Physics passes.
22/11/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: All three are a mandatory requirement.
22/11/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
22/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 340 7203: Oooh owkay, very well noted.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 340 7203: Well received, we will have to share the information with Tendai and discuss on how we can go about it at this stage.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - Harmehak: Thats completely alright please!
22/11/23, 9:26 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries?
22/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 340 7203: thank you so much for your time, you were quiet helpful. I will get in touch if we happen to have any questions after discussing with Tendai

22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 340 7203: Will get in touch with the school and see if its possible...thank you.

18/12/23, 8:15 am - Harmehak: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*

18/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Alright then Tendai, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 131 9112: I see myself getting better at my  clinical skills as a therapist and Edoofa  will help me acquire knowledge, work harder to sharpen my skills
18/12/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tendai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 131 9112: There is better quality education  that improve my skills  that l am more concerned about rather than in my own country were l am not exposed  , meeting different people with their cultures and learning them  
and to learn from my peers
18/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: You see, Tendai, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
18/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Oooh thank you

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Not really, we are still doing research
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
18/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 131 9112: The  scholarship really makes it affordable 

Does the university offer payment plans for the tuition fees
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Tendai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Woooow , that will be greater especially on 90 to 100% scholarship, surely  Edoofa has  its students at heart
18/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
18/12/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Tendai, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
18/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 131 9112: I really do agree
18/12/23, 3:06 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, so now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
18/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 131 9112: Yes l am
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

18/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 131 9112: It is indeed an opportunity to make money for the reduction of higher education fees
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
