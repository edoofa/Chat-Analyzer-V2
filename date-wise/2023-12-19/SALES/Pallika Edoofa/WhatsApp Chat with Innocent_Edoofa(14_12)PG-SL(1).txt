18/12/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Aida, Please share the pictures once received.
18/12/23, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As, Mr. Richard has shared this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Innocent achieving it
18/12/23, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
18/12/23, 1:28 pm - +265 997 08 42 93: Will do exactly the same
18/12/23, 1:28 pm - +265 997 08 42 93: Thank you
18/12/23, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
18/12/23, 1:32 pm - +265 997 08 42 93: This is first time
18/12/23, 1:34 pm - +265 997 08 42 93: How many points is required now
18/12/23, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this once again!
18/12/23, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - +265 997 08 42 93: Thank you for sharing this with us, to make us clearly understand
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - +265 997 08 42 93: Alright thanks now I understand
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are most welcome!
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Based on my evaluation, considering Innocent's subjects, interests, and passion, Innocent is eligible to pursue
