15/12/23, 7:49 am - +263 77 268 6147: Good morning Edoofa team,my name is Herbert Mutanda a father to Arnold.

I have gone through your discussion With my son on various areas.He answered you very well but there are some areas which I need to revisit.

You noted that you offer 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees which is very commendable. Arnold has 3  other siblings who need to be taken care of back home,as a result given the the scenario of Zimbabwe's economic situation,I don't think as parents of Arnold we will manage transport and living costs based on our earnings.

I suggest if you have a special package for those who are less privileged,you may help by adding his name on that list.

On the issue of tuition fees,you only mentioned that you offer 50-100% but I don't know the actual tuition fees I have to pay on top of your provision.

Thank you.
15/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 495 8058: Good afternoon

15/12/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges Mr Herbert and we will be discussing all the aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program in detail in this session where I will also be guiding you through the cost of education.
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
