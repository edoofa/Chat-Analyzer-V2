18/12/23, 1:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. ZImba, Please note that I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
18/12/23, 1:53 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: So i am a 43year old Malawian with 2 children the first being a girl aged 16 and a boy aged 14.

I am a qualified Administrator worked in International Retail as an Administration Manager specifically Shoprite Trading Company for 6 years. Then joined an HIV Management Malawian Trust funded by the USA Government called Lighthouse Trustas a Capacity Building Operations Manager for 10 years. I moved on to another Malawian NGO called Partners in Hope also funded by USA Government as a Care and Treatment Project Manager for 2 years. While with Partners in Hope, I established my own Car Care Business which was a diversification from car importing business. I have founded the busines and in its 6th year now.

I hold a Batchelor of Business Administration with 2nd Class Credit. I took leave of absence from Nottingham Trent University where i was doing MBA in Data Analytics due to finances.

I believe in Education and I believe my Children are uniquely endowed with skill, passion and determination to achieve anything they pit their mind to. I am aware that what they want to become is not fully available in Malawi so an opportunity to study what they want to really become elsewhere is really an exciting prospect for us <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 1:53 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: If you need more information please do let me know
18/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Zimba, It's truly inspiring to hear about your diverse career journey and your commitment to education for both yourself and your children. Exploring opportunities for your children to study abroad and pursue their passions is indeed an exciting prospect.
18/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mr. Zimba
18/12/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Proceeding further, To Guide Smantha become a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with her introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about herself: her strengths, her weaknesses, her hobbies, and a detailed description of her family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Her current educational level MSCE and subject combination
2. The course she would like to study and why
3. What do her parents do (their profession)
4. What is his parent’s highest education level?
5. Does she have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?

7. Who will be financially supporting her higher education abroad
18/12/23, 2:14 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: Samantha is like I said 16, quite an interesting child, strong willed, compassionate, very artistic. She has grown up with an arts inclination, she used to do Ballet, then drawing, clothing design, then went on to do music, really passionate about playing an electric guitar, she loves to perform for an audience at school. She is big on poetry at the moment mostly focusing on mental health. I am happy to share one of her latest poetry pieces.

She is yet to sit for MSCE in August of 2024, her strength is in Humanities. History, Biology, Social and Life Skills, English, Chemistry, Agriculture are her strength.

Samantha would love to do Psychology and become a therapist. 

Samantha's mother is a HR Manager in a construction company and in her final uear of BSc Business Administration. As mentioned already Samantha's fathers is an administrator currently a business owner. 

Samantha has one sibling who is in Form 3.

Samantha's financial support has been her mom and dad and they intend to support her higher education abroad ofcourse with a plan to seek for scholarships
18/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Zimba, Thank you for sharing about Samantha, Moving forward, I kindly request that you share Samantha's MSCE results with me, preferably in picture format for a more comprehensive overview.
18/12/23, 2:17 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: As mentioned she is yet to sit for MSCE in actually July of 2024. She is going into 2nd term of form 4 in January
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Zimba, That is well noted!
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now, we accept up to 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregate of 35, this would be the maximum limit for eligibility. All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program



The minimum requirement was higher pandemic but during the pandemic, a lot of students failed to receive enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements have been lowered but I always encourage my students to target maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident for Samantha about meeting the requirements and performing well in MSCE!
18/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: We anticipate better and lower than 35 for sure
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +265 888 47 64 20: Not yet, this has been our first consideration
