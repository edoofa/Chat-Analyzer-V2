14/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Yeah sure
14/11/23, 8:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Well
I understood that
* Edoofa promotes education so that quality education can be accessed by all students not just few students
* It provides affordability and employability in higher education
* I heard that it accommodates the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker 
* It helps the students from building the application, applying to colleges, training and them ready for jobs.

That is great to hear about it and the most interesting advantage of being an Edoofian is that, it offers not just affordability and accessibility to them but also employability driven by the which is a great fortune.

Yeah that's the summary of what  l understood about Edoofa Scholarship.
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 598 2393: And from the facts that I stated above, l find out that it was a great opportunity to be a member of Edoofa scholarship program
14/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 598 2393: l also  heard that the students can also be part of EWYL where they  will be learning and performing tasks while still proceeding with their academic schedule if they want to earn more credits.
Ehh it is said that, while you will be living in India, you will be provided with dedicated Edoofa mentors who will ensure you that you have a great experience and also will train you with basic skills, provide you career guidance, and evaluating your work related to the EWYL program.
I also heard that the mentor will be there to ensure the collective growth of the Edoofa student community and will also be responsible for a weekly or monthly assessment of your attitude, behavior and discipline while you are in the school and report the results to the Edoofa Academic Board

Yeah so the EWYL program also motivated me to apply for Edoofa Scholarship Program
14/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 598 2393: I'm sorry we have a network issue here

29/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 598 2393: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Unfortunately I started my lower six on second term so first term I wasn't going to school yet and on second term my results where as follows
Mathematics  3 points
Physics             1 point
Computer Science 4 points
29/11/23, 2:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, thank you for sharing this, So, are continuing with your A level or not?
29/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Yeah I'm continuing
29/11/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Vimbai, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad? <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Not yet
29/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Noted and I'm 💯% confident
29/11/23, 3:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!

29/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Okay thanks

29/11/23, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Vimbai, Proceeding further, You have shared that you want to pursue software engineering, so May I know why you have why you haven't opted for Chemistry in A level?
29/11/23, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that too, so why you haven't opted for Chemistry in A level?
29/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 598 2393: I failed chemistry at my o level but instead l passed Computer science and as a blessing in disguise I always wished to be a programmer when I grow up so l just followed my dream
29/11/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, But Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are three aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
29/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Okay
29/11/23, 4:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Please let me know your alternate career aspirations

01/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Okay
From what I know right now about Edoofa and the interviews from different Edoofians l can now dream that Edoofa is the one leading to my destiny. As I heard before that the Edoofa Scholarship Program worked with more than two hundred and fifty universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries over the past six years, it fully tells us that Edoofa can help us to achieve the best in our lives and become  future leaders in our domain. Before l I've heard about Edoofa recommending India as a Higer Education Destination, it was my wish since l started my High school to learn in India as already know that it is one of the countries with best universities which provide higher quality education so due to financial difficulties l started to work as harder as l could in my education hoping that I would get a scholarship after succeeding well in my exams. So hearing about Edoofa recommending India as a higher education destination was a blessing in disguise and now my hope in fulfilling my dreams is built again.
01/12/23, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Vimbai, It's truly inspiring to hear about your journey and aspirations with Edoofa. The extensive network of universities, the community of Edoofians, and the endorsement of India as a higher education destination paint a promising path for your future.

3️⃣Apparently, students studying in India have opportunities for cutting-edge research projects and also have a chance collaborate with experts, and also there are highly qualified faculty members who bring industrial expertise, providing quality instruction etc to the nurture students' academic and professional growth, this is also adding a positive impact on my career.

02/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 598 2393: Greetings to you too 
Yeah I'm doing well

Sure we can begin the session
02/12/23, 10:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Vimbai

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India? <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 598 2393: No we are not aware of it
02/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 598 2393: Since I had already lost hope in learning abroad due to financial difficulties, I didn't continue to my research on expenses of international quality higher education
02/12/23, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
02/12/23, 11:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 598 2393: Umm no
02/12/23, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Vimbai,

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
02/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 598 2393: I think so
You are talking about the Earn While You Learn program right?
02/12/23, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes you are right!!
02/12/23, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/12/23, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
02/12/23, 11:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

02/12/23, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/12/23, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

02/12/23, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
02/12/23, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
02/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 598 2393: Yeah I think so
And I also hope it's not only going to help me reduce my fees but also it will  help me to be adaptable to some certain fields and that will be a blessing in disguise since I will have more experiences
02/12/23, 11:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
02/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 598 2393: Okay thank you now I understand and my hope is rebuilt again.
This amount of money, I think my family is able to afford
02/12/23, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
02/12/23, 12:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker.

02/12/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 598 2393: My Father and my mother and also my uncle promised to support me financially
02/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 598 2393: When I discussed about Edoofa with them, since they always wished the best for me, they were proud of me and also they all put in hope that I'm going to succeed in my career and all their prayers of me achieving my goals have been answered and I will be able to support and change our lives once l became successful in my education and get my degree
02/12/23, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Vimbai, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
02/12/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
02/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Yeah that's it
02/12/23, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
02/12/23, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
02/12/23, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 1:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
02/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Sure go ahead
02/12/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Vimbai, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/12/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/12/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Okay got it
02/12/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
02/12/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Stage one
02/12/23, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
02/12/23, 1:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Yeah sure
02/12/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Vimbai
02/12/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
02/12/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
02/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 598 2393: Yeah I'm clear
02/12/23, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
02/12/23, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
02/12/23, 1:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
