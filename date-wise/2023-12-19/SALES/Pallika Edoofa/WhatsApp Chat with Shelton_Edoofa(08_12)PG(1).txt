*"With a dream, comes the potential for achievement."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
11/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 546 6150: How are you doing t
11/12/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing great and hope the same for you.
11/12/23, 1:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Shelton, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
11/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 546 6150: With the current situation right now I don't know   but there is better anticipated to be in future
11/12/23, 4:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Have you discussed regarding this with your parents? <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 546 6150: Yes I have discussed with them
11/12/23, 5:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Shelton, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity and further students get a chance to self-finance their own higher education by working on the EWYL (earn while you learn) projects which allow you to earn 50-100$ worth scholarships every month that will reduce your tuition fees and lessen the burden on your parents.
