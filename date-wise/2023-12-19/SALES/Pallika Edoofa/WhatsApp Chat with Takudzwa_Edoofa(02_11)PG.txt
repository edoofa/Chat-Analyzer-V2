03/11/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Takudzwa, From the plans and preparations I would like to know about the preparations regarding the financial aspect, as What specific financial plans or strategies have you and your parents put in place to support your tertiary education abroad, given the fluctuations in income as a Farmer

03/11/23, 2:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Takudzwa, Please acknowledge this too
03/11/23, 2:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Takudzwa, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
03/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 311 9841: I yet to write advanced level currently I have only ordinary level
03/11/23, 2:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am aware of that, Takudzwa, I have shared this with you because for now, you are pursuing O level.


However, I would like to know if Would you like to pursue A-levels and seek higher education for the 2025 intake, or are you considering a diploma course with plans to start it in the following year 2024? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 311 9841: Yes
03/11/23, 2:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Takudzwa, Please let me know when you wants to pursue.
03/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 311 9841: 2025 intake is what I am aspiring for
03/11/23, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Takudzwa, That's why I have shared with you the criteria.
03/11/23, 2:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?

07/11/23, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Takudzwa, please don't view it this way. This scholarship program is designed to make higher education more affordable, and accessible, and enhance your employability. However, it's important to note that you'll need to pass the eligibility test that will take place after this session.
07/11/23, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 71 311 9841: OK fine
07/11/23, 4:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Takudzwa, Please go through the above messages
07/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 311 9841: Its now clear to me mam I understand.
07/11/23, 4:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know at which step we are at.
07/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 311 9841: Can I ask now, so on the acceptance into Edoofa program that is were the need for A results ?
07/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 311 9841: The first one which is the personalized counseling session
07/11/23, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Takudzwa, it's essential to understand that, for now, we are processing your application based on your O-level results and your current term grades. Your application will progress further once your eligibility is confirmed. When your A-level results become available, they will also be incorporated into your application.
07/11/23, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
07/11/23, 4:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
07/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 311 9841: Proceed explaining  5 and 6
07/11/23, 4:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
07/11/23, 4:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
