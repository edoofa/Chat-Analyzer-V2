29/11/23, 2:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, 
I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
29/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Not sure
29/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 71 923 1687: may you kindly let us know the costs involved
29/11/23, 8:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 8:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 8:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
29/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 923 1687: unfortunately no. i had got the impression that its a full scholarship
29/11/23, 8:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
29/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 923 1687: ok noted
29/11/23, 8:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 8:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
30/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 058 4029: Okyy
30/11/23, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today, Innocent
30/11/23, 9:06 am - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, continuing the discussion,  let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
30/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 058 4029: Can you explain further
30/11/23, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Innocent
30/11/23, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
30/11/23, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
30/11/23, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

30/11/23, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
30/11/23, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
30/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 058 4029: Yess i think so and i am willing to be part of the program
30/11/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
30/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 058 4029: Oky basically i can do many jobs whixh i can handle at time there is no limit
30/11/23, 9:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Inncocent, Please note that you can work on the EWYL projects based and can earn the scholarship credits and there is no limit for that as it depends upon your hardwork
30/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 058 4029: Oky i understand
30/11/23, 10:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Innocent, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 058 4029: I am very sorry but it seems we cannot afford the finance required
30/11/23, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, I would like to know your family's understanding from the document
30/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Yess there have understood the document but i sorry that we cannnot afford the financials because of various reasons

01/12/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Are you ready for the same?
01/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Yess i am
01/12/23, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing, Innocent?
01/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 058 4029: I am great and you
01/12/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great.
01/12/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, Have your parents compared the cost of education there in Zimbabwe and through our program?
01/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Yess they have
01/12/23, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, is it difficult for them to raise 100$ a mont <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 058 4029: I am not sure but what i  certain is that the whole feee transport and the that we have to pay per semester is expensive for us
01/12/23, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, Please note that it is a one time investment once you are found eligible for the program. Once you qualify and enroll, you'll kickstart the process of earning valuable scholarship credits. These credits, averaging around 50-100$ per month, provide a significant opportunity for you to independently finance your higher education before you embark on your journey to India. It's an investment that pays off in more ways than one.
01/12/23, 8:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that there is a slight change in the scheduled time is 10:00 AM CAT tomorrow (02/11/2023)
02/12/23, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,
I hope that you are doing well today,

Shall we begin the session?
02/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 058 4029: Yess we should
02/12/23, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, Innocent, Please address this <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 058 4029: That would be a great start because before i even get the chance to get to india i might be able to help my self and family on the scholarship credits which would be an advantage for me and my family
02/12/23, 10:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Exactly, So, is your family will be able to do that?
02/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 058 4029: I think you should talk to them on your professional side because according to the talk that we had the side they are not able
02/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 923 1687: Kindly note that Innocent fees are paid for by an institution looking after more than 100children.

Many many people are involved in putting together funds for the children.

On that note we have set regulations like the fact that people proceed to local universities after A-level.

Studies outside the country are done under a confirmed 100% scholarship.

Remember that it's more then the 3200 per year. 

Who will cover his air ticket and medical insurance cover?

If he does not get a job to earn credits the institution will have to cover the unforeseen expenditure - that is not feasible.
02/12/23, 2:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Hello how are you
04/12/23, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Education is a Key to Success*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session? <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Sure it is the key how have you been
04/12/23, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
04/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Im great and you
04/12/23, 1:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I'm interested in understanding if, as mentioned by your mother, you have the intention to pursue the current program. Additionally, she has affirmed that you plan to further your education at local universities after completing A levels.
04/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 058 4029: She is currently planning something so that i can continue with the program ,she has asked s friend to help me with the program because she really wants me to persue my higher education with the best facillities.
04/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 058 4029: I can make the friend join the group after i have talked to her that would be tomorrow
04/12/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Innocent
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 058 4029: So can we continue with today's session
04/12/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Innocent
04/12/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 058 4029: They see it as a great opportunity to venture in to the world and learn different cultures as well as gain skills from different countries which are education based and non education which would help me in the future
04/12/23, 4:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents. <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
04/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Okyy i can do that and get all the forms
04/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Can you explain more further on the statement of purpose
04/12/23, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a crucial essay in your graduate school application. It holds significant weight as it provides the admission committee with insights into your identity, reasons for applying, and why you are a strong candidate. Essentially, it outlines your aspirations for graduate school and articulates your future goals. This document serves as a key tool for the committee to understand your motivations, academic background, and how well you align with the program's objectives.
04/12/23, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
04/12/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
04/12/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 4:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
04/12/23, 4:38 pm - ~ thug_17 added +44 7818 717994
04/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 058 4029: This is georgina flaming who helping with my financial she is from Zof africa she is sponsoring in paying my fee for the program
04/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Yess explain
04/12/23, 4:57 pm - +44 7818 717994: Hello, I am Georgina the CEO of ZOF Africa. We are considering helping Innocent with your programme. I understand it is not yet clear which university Innocent would go to in India. Is that correct? Do you have a shortlist?
04/12/23, 5:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Georgina, 
I am Ms. Pallika, a career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Austin, Senior Career Counselor, and  Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa
04/12/23, 5:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
04/12/23, 5:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/12/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

04/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 058 4029: I think i am understanding this program much better
04/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 058 4029: On phase one what exactly do you look at in order for the student to be competent for the program
04/12/23, 5:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Innocent, this scholarship program is open to all individuals who are interested, and we are here to assist and guide them at every step as their counselors.
04/12/23, 5:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Okyy i am interested
04/12/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Stage 1
04/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!! <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
04/12/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Yess
04/12/23, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
04/12/23, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
04/12/23, 5:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
04/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 058 4029: Yess they are clear and precise
04/12/23, 5:42 pm - +44 7818 717994: Thank you Ms Pallika. So Innocent has not yet been accepted into the scholarship programme but in order to advance with his application he/we would need to pay a $350 fee reimbursable if he does not receive the scholarship. If he does, the $350 will go towards his future fees. Is that right?
04/12/23, 6:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me please help you with the process. Indeed, Innocent has not yet qualified for the scholarship program. We have now come to the end of the first stage which is the counselling session after which you will be given time to discuss as a family and then we will begin the eligibility check stage for Innocent. If he passes the eligibility check, he will receive the Acceptance Letter through the Edoofa program only after which you are supposed to pay the enrollment fee.
04/12/23, 6:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is for *-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
04/12/23, 7:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
04/12/23, 7:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
