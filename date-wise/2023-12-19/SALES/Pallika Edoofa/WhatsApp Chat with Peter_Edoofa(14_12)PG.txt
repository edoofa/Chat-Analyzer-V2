15/12/23, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Peter, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
15/12/23, 2:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, 
As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
15/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Yes , l conducted extensive research on foreign education. I explored different aspects of studying abroad, including Universities, academic programs , admission requirements, and living costs . I also researched scholarship opportunities, visa requirements, and the overall experience of international students in different countries. This research helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities available
15/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 083 8150: That's true , not all students are privileged to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons especially here in our county, Zimbabwe in general and Chiredzi in particular
15/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
15/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Truly, it's really intriguing ,l can't wait to be an Edoofian
15/12/23, 6:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 083 8150: No , we're not aware of the expenses
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/12/23, 6:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?* <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Will you please delve deep into the “earn while you learn"process

15/12/23, 6:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,

 let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
15/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 083 8150: I don't know how

*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/12/23, 7:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
15/12/23, 7:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*

15/12/23, 8:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

It's important to have access to the right information at the right time for effective career planning.

16/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Okay am waiting..
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through the above shared certificate and Let me know this.

16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
16/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Thank you for expressing your agreement with my acknowledgement of ““expert career counselling"by Edoofa. Indeed having access to the right information at the right time plays a vital role in successful career planning
16/12/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
16/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Thank you for considering discussing everything with them after today's session. It would be beneficial to connect with some beneficiaries from my country to gain a better understanding of the proceedings. Regarding how my family feels about studying abroad, they are supportive and enthusiastic about the opportunity. They believe that studying abroad can provide me with valuable international exposure, educational advancement, and personal growth. Their encouragement and support have been crucial in my decision to pursue higher education abroad.
16/12/23, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Peter, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
16/12/23, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
16/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Yes, you are absolutely correct. When a student plans to apply for a university abroad, the following requirements are typically involved:

1) *Application Form*: This is a formal document where students provide their personal and academic information, including educational background, achievements, and contact details.

2) *Statement of Purpose*: Often required for graduate school applications, this essay highlights the student's motivations, goals, academic interests, and how they align with the chosen program or university. It helps the admission committee in assessing the applicant's suitability.

3) *Letter(s) of Recommendation*: These letters are written by senior authorities, such as professors, employers, or academic advisors, who can attest to the student's capabilities, skills, and suitability for higher education. These recommendations add credibility to the application.

These three components - application form, statement of purpose, and letter of recommendation - are typically crucial parts of the application package when applying to a university abroad.
18/12/23, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
How are you doing today,
I hope you had a great weekend, please excuse me I couldn’t reach out to you as I was not well.

So, Shall we begin the session?
18/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 083 8150: I'm doing great and you , it's l totally get what you are saying
18/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you Peter for understanding!
18/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That is right!
18/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
18/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
18/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
18/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 083 8150: I'm so sorry , but l need to ask to postpone our session .I have a lot of work to do and won't be able to give my full attention. I hope we can reschedule for another time. Thank you for understanding
18/12/23, 1:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Peter, May I know by what time you will be available now?
18/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 083 8150: I think tommorow will do
18/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 083 8150: Same time
18/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Peter
18/12/23, 8:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
