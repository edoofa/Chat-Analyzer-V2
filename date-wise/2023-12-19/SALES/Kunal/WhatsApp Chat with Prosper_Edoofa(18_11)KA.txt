20/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 895 6269: My name's Prosper Moyo. I've always been skilled at working toward common goals and working hard. Also, i do not hesitate to try new things.

Time management is one of my biggest weaknesses. This is because i have always paid close attention to detail, hence at times i take longer than i anticipate to complete a task. This is why i started using time table, to guide me in time management.This has tirned out to be my weakness or challenge.

First of all, I'm into photography  and tech. I also like music, reading, and cooking.

I wrote my A level examinations this year, and i am currently waiting for the results. The subjects I did were History, Family and Religious Studies, and also Literature in Ndebele.

I want to study LLB. This is because it will help me in critical thinking and problem solving, which may also be applicable in life. Also, LLB will allow me to make a difference. This isin tetms of people in general, business and communities. It will also help me develop business development skills. Moreover, i am also passionate about legal matters.

My parents are currently self employed.

My parent's highest education level is O level, that is form 4.


I do have siblings, 3 of them actually. They are all at school.

My education has been funded by  an organisation named HIGHERLIFE FOUNDATION.

My fees were $200USD per term
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - Austin: It's great to learn more about you. Your strengths in teamwork and willingness to try new things will undoubtedly contribute to a dynamic student community.
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Austin: May I know the nature of the job of your parents within self employment?
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Austin: I see you are well motivated towards this career path in Law and looking forward to excelling in it

So do you have any past experiences or learnings in this field specifically?

20/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Vendor

13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
13/12/23, 1:11 pm - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
13/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Yes i am
13/12/23, 1:22 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that

13/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 895 6269: YES please

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

18/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 895 6269: Wow

18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
