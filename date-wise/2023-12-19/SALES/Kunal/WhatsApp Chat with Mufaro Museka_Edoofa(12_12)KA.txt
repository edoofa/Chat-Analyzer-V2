I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 883 6462: I am
12/12/23, 1:35 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*

12/12/23, 2:54 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?

12/12/23, 3:25 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
12/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Yes,the the top ranked Jawaharlal Nehru university in India cost $8000 per semester for international students
12/12/23, 3:32 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 3:33 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:33 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
12/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Understood
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand more on *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
12/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
12/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 883 6462: I am excited to learn about the earn as you learn program as it is focusing on real time online projects which is something that I am interested in as I like creating digital work as a hobby and so it is in sync with what I like.
Yes,I will be benefiting from the earn while you learn program because I am getting extra skills on digital marketing,creative content creation and social media engagement over and above the primary law career
12/12/23, 4:15 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Excellent,thank you
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
12/12/23, 4:20 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
12/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 883 6462: I liked the point that you help prospective students to process visa’s which could be difficult for someone who does not know their way around
12/12/23, 4:32 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education,services and guidance
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

12/12/23, 4:32 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
12/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Both of my parents will be helping with the remaining fee
12/12/23, 4:40 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
12/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 883 6462: They are excited about the opportunity
12/12/23, 4:43 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
12/12/23, 4:43 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
12/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Thank you,is there a different application form other than the one I submitted and when do I submit the statement of purpose and letter of recommendation
12/12/23, 4:48 pm - Kunal: Let me guide you ahead
12/12/23, 4:48 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
12/12/23, 4:48 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Thank u kindly guide when all these are required
12/12/23, 4:55 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 4:55 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
12/12/23, 4:55 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Thank you,I would really like to be connected to some students who got scholarships under this program and understand how the process works better
12/12/23, 4:59 pm - Kunal: That is alright
12/12/23, 4:59 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 883 6462: We have discussed up to stage 5
12/12/23, 5:02 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
12/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Okay
12/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
12/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Yes I am clear
12/12/23, 5:08 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

13/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 883 6462: They are excited about the program and are very supportive.What enlightens them most is the earn while you earn program which we assume will aid in providing my basic requirements
13/12/23, 3:16 pm - Kunal: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. May I know if your family has any queries, please
13/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 883 6462: They have questions as to when the earn as you learn program starts and at what stage are the course of payments are to be made
13/12/23, 3:32 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand
The Earn While You Learn program will start after you are enrolled in the program while being in your country and making your cost of education more affordable

The enrollment fee is to be paid only if you are found eligible for the program and I will be guiding you further in detail.
13/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 883 6462: Understood,thank you
13/12/23, 3:52 pm - Kunal: Alright Mufaro
May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
13/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 883 6462: They are uncertain about when the enrollment fee is paid and if it is now it can be very hard because of need to pay for current fees for school
13/12/23, 4:12 pm - Kunal: I understand
If we begin the eligibility check stage today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if you qualify for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall on the next week of December. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 883 6462: I still have another year in high school and it’s a birding school,therefore i cannot start the earn as you learn program
13/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 361 7381: The timeframe for starting payments next week of December is not feasible...is is possible we postpone the the Eligibility process to a date advised by us as we are not ready to do any payments now
13/12/23, 4:35 pm - Kunal: That is fine
The working timings will be flexible and will make your free time productive
13/12/23, 4:35 pm - Kunal: May I know why is that please? <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 361 7381: As indicated we are not ready to pay for the first enrolment fee now...but we can advise at a later stage when we are ready
13/12/23, 5:03 pm - Kunal: I do understand and respect your thoughts,
Do you feel is too early for this commitment if your child qualifies or are other reasons for the same?
13/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 361 7381: We were not ready for any payments now...we thought   payments would be done close to her finishing sch or sometime next year as our focus now is finding money for her current fees...so its a matter of strategising how best to find the money and cannot be done over night...wonder if there is flexibility to pay at a later stage say next year if she qualifies?
13/12/23, 5:28 pm - Kunal: That is well understood and being a parent it is important to have proper planning for your child's career!
There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also give the opportunity to parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
13/12/23, 5:31 pm - Kunal: 2) The other major aspect is a *proper financial preparation as higher Education abroad is an important decision*
13/12/23, 5:31 pm - Kunal: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
13/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 361 7381: Thank you for all this clarification and very helpful...On the side I have checked with Mufaro' school mate parents whose child has already secured a scholarship...they have advised us that you are flexible on payments...so Its just that we did not understand how this process works....so we can proceed...
13/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 361 7381: Very true
13/12/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 361 7381: Thank you for this guidance its important to plan now
13/12/23, 6:26 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
13/12/23, 6:29 pm - Kunal: May I know if Mufaro is available?
13/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 883 6462: I am
13/12/23, 6:32 pm - Kunal: Mufaro, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

Shall we proceed?

14/12/23, 10:37 pm - +263 77 361 7381: Our concern she will not be able to use the law degree elsewhere in the world...we have examples of some Zimbabweans who got their law degrees in India and cant use the degree.eleshere in the world..even trying convectionaries is equally difficult in zim or elsewhere...so we dont want her to do a degree and get stuck...if she was doing sciences...we know India wud be good...but not law...thank you for your interest in helping us
15/12/23, 12:15 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon, Mrs Takaitei
15/12/23, 12:16 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing your concern, let me help you understand
15/12/23, 12:17 pm - Kunal: Let me give you an understanding of how to practice law in Zimbabwe after graduating. It's true after completing the law from India the child will be evaluated by the BAR Council of Zimbabwe after which the child will have an exam then they can practice law in Zimbabwe which wouldn't be a challenge because there is a proper process set for the same
15/12/23, 12:17 pm - Kunal: There are few courses in the field of Commerce and Law which have similar basics across the Globe but the syllabus varies based on the location where you study the course

Let us take the example of the law. The basics of law are the same if you study from Zimbabwe, India, the USA, the UK etc but vary in terms of the economy, governance of a country, legislation etc. Once the student completes the course and wants to practice in a different country, then the BAR Council of the country will evaluate the subjects of the students and there would be an exam which he/she needs to clear after which they can practice law in that country. This procedure is the same if you want to practice it in any country. The Indian law degree is internationally accredited and you can practice Globally
