*I am Mr. Kunal, Career Counselor at Edoofa and with us, we have Mr. Jyotishman, Head of Admissions and Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.

Due to the overwhelming response from applicants, we wanted to ensure you receive personalized attention. Therefore, we've scheduled a dedicated time slot just for you:

📅 *Date: 19th December 2023*
🕤 *Time: 10:00 AM CAT*

Please mark the time to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. <This message was edited>
