18/12/23, 2:08 pm - Kunal: Well noted
As you mentioned that it is his desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because a student need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible. At the same time, I do acknowledge his strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference, due to which he is eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*4) Bachelor of Optometry*
*5) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology etc*

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
18/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
18/12/23, 4:17 pm - +265 992 74 84 45: I will.come.back to you after consulting him after knocking off.... Sorry I had visitors at office
18/12/23, 4:17 pm - Kunal: Alright please
