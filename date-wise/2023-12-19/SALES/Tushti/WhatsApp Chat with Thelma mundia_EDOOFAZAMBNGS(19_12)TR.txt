19/12/23, 12:06 pm - Tushti: I shall explain that as we proceed further
19/12/23, 12:06 pm - Tushti: Alright so Thelma, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination
2. The course you would like to study and why
3. What do your parents do (their profession)
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?

19/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 96 5471068: My name is Thelma mundia. My strengths are that I am hardworking and I am focused. My weaknesses are that I sometimes tend to be emotionally weak and I’m socially awkward. My hobbies are photography, reading, cooking and  drawing. My family is very complicated, I have two sets of parents and on both sides I have a lot of siblings. I currently live with my father and step mother in Choma with my other siblings. I do go to my mother and step father’s home for holidays sometimes. I grew up with my mother but  I am now living with my father. I am the first born on my father’s side but the second born on my mother’s side.
My educational level is O level.
My subject combination was 
Additional mathematics 
Ordinary mathematics 
English

Pure chemistry 
Pure physics.
I would love to study Medicine or any IT related course as my second option.
My father is a policeman and businessman and my mother is lawyer.
My parents’ highest educational levels is tertiary level education.
Yes I do have siblings, I’m the oldest on my father’s side and second oldest on my mother’s side so most of my siblings are still in school or not yet old enough to start school. 
Both my parents have supported my education so far.
My father is the one who will be supporting my higher education level abroad. 
The amount for my fee per term in dollars is $86 and 25 cents.
My school is Njase girls’ secondary school, I live within southern province of Zambia.
19/12/23, 12:44 pm - Tushti: Noted with thanks
19/12/23, 12:45 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to plan to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
19/12/23, 12:51 pm - +260 96 5471068: On my mother’s side, she struggles to make ends meet sometimes because she is currently a single parent because of relationship complications. While on my father’s side he manages to keep the family afloat.
19/12/23, 1:18 pm - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
19/12/23, 1:21 pm - +260 96 5471068: As I mention earlier my father is a businessman so I’m certain he can manage to support me for the extra costs.
19/12/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: I would like for the parent to come online and answer
19/12/23, 1:25 pm - +260 96 2281885: We own multiple businesses and education is a priority when it comes to our children so if she manages to get the scholarship we would gladly sponsor the rest.
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - Tushti: Would the family be able to raise around $2000 per year?
19/12/23, 2:01 pm - +260 96 2281885: Yes we would
19/12/23, 2:20 pm - Tushti: Duly noted

19/12/23, 3:01 pm - Tushti: I shall beed the final results when they are announced
19/12/23, 3:02 pm - +260 96 5471068: I am unable to do that
19/12/23, 3:03 pm - Tushti: May I know whether the student wishes to study medicine or IT? You must choose a field. Looking at the results, I feel IT is the better option. There are more jobs internationally these days for IT professionals as well
19/12/23, 3:03 pm - +260 96 5471068: I would love to study IT
19/12/23, 3:04 pm - +260 96 5471068: Okay
19/12/23, 3:04 pm - Tushti: Let me now brief you about the course

19/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 96 5471068: Sounds interesting
19/12/23, 3:11 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
19/12/23, 3:39 pm - +260 96 5471068: If I am provided with this career option, in five years I see myself as someone who would be financially stable and more independent. Doing this course would also be an opportunity to study abroad and possibly find a job as well because in today’s world it’s all about technology. Additionally I am hopefully aiming to do a masters degree if I were to get enrolled for the course. 
Doing this course would help me  achieve my dreams in the sense that I will be able to support my siblings financially. Also I am looking forward to helping my mom out as she faces some struggles sometimes. It is also a huge opportunity for me to do what I love because IT is something I’m passionate about.
Doing this course would definitely help me achieve my dreams because it can make it possible to study abroad because no one in my family has studied abroad before. It would be a huge deal for me. I am also very optimistic because it would help me acquire foreign knowledge that I can bring back to my country Zambia.
I am really interested in this course  because all of its categories are everything I would want to do. I know for a fact that in five years there wouldn’t be any other course I would have rather done.
I also have dreams of someday creating a application or website that can be used world wide and be on a bill board so IT is definitely the right choice for me. I feel it’s an amazing course and it’s something I would never get tired of doing unlike the other courses that are there where I would wake up groaning and dreading to go to work.
19/12/23, 3:45 pm - Tushti: That is really great Thelma, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
19/12/23, 3:52 pm - +260 96 5471068: I am very willing, 200% sure of it
19/12/23, 3:55 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - +260 96 5471068: It’s because I’m interested in more opportunities and ways of expanding my knowledge in a number of areas. I am also interested in learning different cultures and ways of doing things hence my ambition to study abroad. I also feel like my career would thrive more if I secured it abroad
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: I see
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - +260 96 5471068: Well Indians are some of the smartest people in the world and it could only be because of the top class education system in my opinion. I have researched a few times and I found out that Indian universities such as Indian institute of Technology (IIT) offer good services that have helped to build great minds. Other than that there is a vast range of courses in India which makes it easier for one to achieve there dreams.
Also I watch a lot of YouTube videos and most that talk about knowledgeable things are made by Indians.
19/12/23, 4:16 pm - Tushti: Very well researched. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:
19/12/23, 4:16 pm - Tushti: 1. Robust Education System: India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

19/12/23, 4:20 pm - +260 96 5471068: This is all very inspiring, I am now even more amazed.
19/12/23, 4:21 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - +260 96 2281885: No we are not familiar with the total cost
19/12/23, 4:24 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/12/23, 4:24 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/12/23, 4:25 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/12/23, 4:25 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:25 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/12/23, 4:25 pm - Tushti: In simple wordswhat we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - +260 96 2281885: This is all amazing
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - +260 96 2281885: May I ask about the earn while you learn program?
19/12/23, 4:29 pm - Tushti: Now let me brief you about the EWYL Program
19/12/23, 4:29 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
19/12/23, 4:29 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/12/23, 4:29 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
19/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 96 5471068: Yes this is very different from what I saw on other international higher education platforms. It is way more affordable and promising.
19/12/23, 4:35 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 4:36 pm - +260 96 5471068: Sure
19/12/23, 4:38 pm - Tushti: So, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 4:43 pm - Tushti: Do calculate the answer
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - +260 96 5471068: About $1500 to $2250
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - Tushti: Exactl, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/12/23, 4:45 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 4:50 pm - +260 96 2281885: Yes we do think edoofa is helping many people
19/12/23, 4:51 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 4:51 pm - Tushti: Thelma basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before theirGrade 12 result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final G12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/12/23, 4:51 pm - +260 96 5471068: Sure
19/12/23, 4:51 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
19/12/23, 4:51 pm - Tushti: Is this understood?
19/12/23, 4:55 pm - +260 96 5471068: Yes completely
19/12/23, 4:55 pm - +260 96 2281885: Yes this is understood
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

'
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: Alright Thelma, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
19/12/23, 5:00 pm - +260 96 5471068: I would you know which scholarship you qualify for whether 50% or 100%. It is before or after paying for application fee?
19/12/23, 5:00 pm - +260 96 5471068: How *
19/12/23, 5:01 pm - Tushti: That would be before payment
19/12/23, 5:01 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/12/23, 5:01 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
19/12/23, 5:01 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!
