18/12/23, 10:41 am - +260 779772403: Ok well I am more than interested now
18/12/23, 10:42 am - +260 779772403: It's just my thing the course is so rich and packed with the necessary skills I need for my future business and job to do but if I may ask what is Agriculture business and management all about but I love the outlined course above
18/12/23, 10:43 am - +260 779772403: So what should I do or rather what are my qualifications to do my desired
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
18/12/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 11:00 am - +260 779772403: First of all am from an average family and education is my number one priority I believe it can unlock all my dreams and make my family better with edoofa scholarship I can get  quality education which is cheaper and it is incorporated with practical programs which will fully equip me for my future career. And after my course in 5yrs time I see my self as a manage. I would like to work for 3 yrs so as to get a very vast experience and later upgrade myself by getting a masters degree .
   From there I would love to start my own farm project were I will be growing cash crops and keeping livestock with creating at least about 30 job opportunities to the youths in my country working and my farm and I would conduct personal research to try and find better ways to improve agriculture production without harming the environment and lastly I would love to actually at the end of it all after making it to sponsor students about 3 each year for the edoofa scholarship and help them with the money required to be part of the big family
18/12/23, 11:01 am - Tushti: That is really great Luyando, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
18/12/23, 11:03 am - +260 779772403: Yes I am
18/12/23, 11:04 am - +260 779772403: Am willing to do what it takes to make sure this world becomes a better place
18/12/23, 1:32 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/12/23, 1:32 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 1:32 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

18/12/23, 1:34 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
18/12/23, 2:38 pm - +260 779772403: Yes it's a reflection of how I was planning to spend my university life
18/12/23, 2:38 pm - +260 779772403: If possible I want to take up the responsibility of my university expenses and make the burden less heavy for my parents
18/12/23, 2:40 pm - Tushti: That's great <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:40 pm - Tushti: Luyando, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/12/23, 2:42 pm - +260 779772403: They would spend alot am sure
18/12/23, 2:46 pm - Tushti: Can you calculate the amount?
18/12/23, 2:46 pm - +260 779772403: In dollars or kwacha
18/12/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: In dollars
18/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 779772403: It's between 1500 to 2500 dollars
18/12/23, 3:01 pm - Tushti: Exactly Luyando, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 3:01 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/12/23, 3:01 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?

18/12/23, 3:11 pm - +260 779772403: Yes very much
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand!
18/12/23, 3:15 pm - Tushti: ?
18/12/23, 3:19 pm - +260 779772403: Yes so what happens if they don't finish paying during the time given
18/12/23, 3:19 pm - +260 779772403: The flexible payment
18/12/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Well, the application would be cancelled
18/12/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - +260 779772403: And then that's the end for that student
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: Alright Luyando, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
18/12/23, 3:22 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
18/12/23, 3:26 pm - +260 779772403: If u fail to go to the other step can u retry again all u are just given a chance when you mess up then that's it
18/12/23, 3:31 pm - Tushti: You may reapply again
18/12/23, 3:31 pm - Tushti: May I know why you ask this? Are you facing a challenge?
18/12/23, 3:31 pm - Tushti: How can I help?
18/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 779772403: Yes right now my parents are not financially stable alot has happened just this year and I don't think they will have the money the 350 dollars
18/12/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: In that case they could opt for the part payment of $200 first
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 779772403: I don't know how you can help me try trust me am passionate in making a difference in my life and world at large but has it stands I don't know if my parents will manage all the formalities required as I come to India
18/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 779772403: Then the other one when do u pay for it
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Tushti: After 30 days
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Tushti: Dear, kindly ask you parents to have a session with me tomorrow
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Tushti: Let me see what we can do for you, since you are a hard working student
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!
