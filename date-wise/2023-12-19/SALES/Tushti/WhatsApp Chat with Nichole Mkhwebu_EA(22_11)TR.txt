16/12/23, 9:21 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 874 6841: Yes
16/12/23, 10:01 am - Tushti: May I know why there was no response on the group for the past two days? Is the family not serious about this application?
16/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 874 6841: Is it possible that l can  withdraw from the application
16/12/23, 10:06 am - Tushti: May I know the reason, please?
16/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 874 6841: Am sorry,  l have decided to apply for local college
16/12/23, 10:20 am - Tushti: Our Academician Mr Piyush visited Zimbabwe in the month of March this year for around 70 days to conduct various workshops for the students regarding the Edoofa Program, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly $1100 is spent on just food while the cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, and travelling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 874 6841: Yes l do
16/12/23, 10:27 am - Tushti: Don't you think it would be far more beneficial for you to pursue your tertiary education in a better reputed International University based in a country that has a stable economy and no inflation, unlike Zimbabwe, after which you could get employment oppurtunities as well, that too at the same cost?
16/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 874 6841: Yes it's true l think l didn't look at it from that perspective
16/12/23, 10:30 am - Tushti: Well, do have a discussion with your family regarding the same, and let me know your final decision as a family by Monday
16/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 874 6841: Okay thank you for understanding will let you know on Monday 🙂
16/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 874 6841: Can l ask do guys also offer tertiary scholarship or it's just for university level only
16/12/23, 10:43 am - Tushti: Dear, tertiary education and university level are one and the same thing
16/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 874 6841: Oh okay
16/12/23, 10:56 am - Tushti: So, we shall now be in touch when you have made your final decision
16/12/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on *Monday at 9:30 am* Please be online during your session time!
