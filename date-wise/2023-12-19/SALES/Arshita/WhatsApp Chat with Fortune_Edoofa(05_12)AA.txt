Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system.

08/12/23, 8:55 am - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
08/12/23, 8:55 am - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics

08/12/23, 9:00 am - +265 886 62 25 64: I have read

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
08/12/23, 9:07 am - +265 886 62 25 64: No , i don't know about it
08/12/23, 9:11 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 9:12 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 9:12 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
08/12/23, 9:14 am - +265 886 62 25 64: Yes , it is affordable
08/12/23, 9:14 am - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
08/12/23, 9:20 am - +265 886 62 25 64: No , and what types of working opportunities
08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 9:21 am - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
08/12/23, 9:23 am - +265 886 62 25 64: Yes, i will benefit the experience and also earn so that i can help my parents with bills
08/12/23, 9:24 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

08/12/23, 9:32 am - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
08/12/23, 9:32 am - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
08/12/23, 9:32 am - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
08/12/23, 9:32 am - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
08/12/23, 9:32 am - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
08/12/23, 9:32 am - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
08/12/23, 9:33 am - +265 886 62 25 64: I like number 3
08/12/23, 9:35 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

08/12/23, 9:36 am - +265 886 62 25 64: This is wonderful
08/12/23, 9:36 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/12/23, 9:39 am - +265 886 62 25 64: My parents will be helping me
08/12/23, 9:40 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/12/23, 9:57 am - +265 886 62 25 64: Okay sir, will definitely talk about it , after working hours
08/12/23, 9:58 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
08/12/23, 9:58 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
08/12/23, 10:00 am - +265 886 62 25 64: Yes , those are the requirements
08/12/23, 10:04 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
08/12/23, 10:04 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/12/23, 10:05 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 10:05 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
08/12/23, 10:51 am - +265 886 62 25 64: Yes ,you can
08/12/23, 10:53 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
08/12/23, 10:53 am - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/12/23, 11:06 am - +265 886 62 25 64: This is well understood
08/12/23, 11:08 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their MSCE result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final MSCE results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/12/23, 11:29 am - +265 886 58 51 14: thats cool
08/12/23, 11:30 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 11:44 am - +265 886 62 25 64: We have finished personalised counselling  session
08/12/23, 11:44 am - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
08/12/23, 11:47 am - +265 886 62 25 64: Okay sir
08/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
08/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
08/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
08/12/23, 11:48 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
08/12/23, 11:49 am - +265 886 62 25 64: Very much clear , thank you
08/12/23, 4:34 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

Are you ready for the same?
09/12/23, 1:16 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Good afternoon , after discussing with our ward , we see this to be a very good initiative and we were very ready to proceed but after calculating the cost that we have to be paying yearly , we have decided not to continue with this scholarship , we thank you for welcoming us and willing to help us , we believe when things become better in our country we will surely contact you again
09/12/23, 1:16 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this
09/12/23, 1:26 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mrs Tamara

I hope you are doing well
09/12/23, 1:27 pm - Austin: I do understand the challenges and have you compared the cost of education in Malawi with that through the Edoofa program?
09/12/23, 1:30 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Am fine
09/12/23, 1:30 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Its better she studies here its at least cheeper
09/12/23, 1:30 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Cheaper*
09/12/23, 1:36 pm - Austin: Good to know!
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Austin: As per your understanding, how much would her total expense be if studying in Malawi?
09/12/23, 1:38 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: 1000USD per year
09/12/23, 1:49 pm - Austin: Is this inclusive of Food, Accommodation, Wifi/ Internet etc?
09/12/23, 1:50 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Yes it is
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: And if we apply for Higher education loan it will be slashed to less than that
09/12/23, 2:02 pm - Austin: So, don't you have to repay it or pay the interests?
09/12/23, 2:07 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Yes , that is when she has been successfully gone through the loan process
09/12/23, 2:25 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 2:26 pm - Austin: Yearly that is :
Accommodation yearly- MK500, 000
Food yearly- MK300, 000 
WiFi-it depends on how bundles are 
Upkeep- MK450, 000
Total- MK 1,250,000 and above
09/12/23, 2:27 pm - Austin: Mrs Tamara, we have a lot of students from Malawi who apply for their higher education for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. There are students who have discontinued their course in Malawi and is now a part of the Edoofa program because the cost of education is lower than that of Malawi
09/12/23, 2:28 pm - Austin: We also have students who applied for Masters and they have shared their Bachelors fee break up in Malawi and it was around $2000 including tuition,, food, Accommodation, Wifi, etc
09/12/23, 2:30 pm - Austin: This is an example given by one such student and the fee notification from UNIMA. 

Now, I have gone through the discussions and academic background of Fortune and was looking forward to recommend her for a higher quantum of scholarship through the Edoofa Scholarship Program if she qualifies performing well in the interviews!
09/12/23, 2:34 pm - Austin: For example, if the cost of education of Fortune after the Edoofa Scholarship Program is $1600 per annum and she earns at least $70 through the Earn While you Learn Program making a total of $840 per annum.

The remaining annual fees would be $1600-$840= $760 which can be paid in two equal installments.
09/12/23, 2:35 pm - Austin: This is just an example and students have even earned more than $400 per month and self financed their higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program. <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 2:35 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 2:38 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: We will see into it ,
09/12/23, 2:40 pm - Austin: Sure Mrs Tamara
I have just shown you the difference in cost of education and how Edoofa Scholarship Program is cheaper than studying in Malawi, we are yet to compare the quality of education, exposure and opportunities ahead after graduation.
