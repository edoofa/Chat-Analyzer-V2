07/12/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
07/12/23, 12:56 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
07/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes I am confident about achieving it.
07/12/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 079 3505: You are welcome.
07/12/23, 1:00 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 079 3505: No I have not made any prior research on foreign education nor have l applied to any University abroad.
07/12/23, 1:05 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
07/12/23, 1:32 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique.

07/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Noted with thanks.... Thank you for the information
07/12/23, 1:34 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 079 3505: No I am not familiar with the cost of quality education for an international student.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
07/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 079 3505: It is not affordable according to what my mother earns.
07/12/23, 1:46 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
07/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 079 3505: No I do not know.
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
07/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 079 3505: The Earn While You Learn program is good because it helps students to develop more skills.
Yes I will benefit from the program.
07/12/23, 1:56 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
07/12/23, 1:56 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes I can realize how l can use the program.
07/12/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
07/12/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
07/12/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
07/12/23, 1:58 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 079 3505: I like point 3.Earn While You Learn program.
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

07/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Noted...
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 079 3505: My mother will be helping me with the remaining fee.
07/12/23, 2:03 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
07/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 079 3505: My family is proud of me.
07/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes I will discuss with her.
07/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
07/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
07/12/23, 2:05 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
07/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Noted...
07/12/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
07/12/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/12/23, 2:07 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:07 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
07/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes application form, statement of purpose and letter of recommendation are required.
07/12/23, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Absolutely
07/12/23, 2:08 pm - Arshita: Shall I sum up?
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 079 3505: I will get back to you.
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: We are about to end our session in 5 minutes. 

Can we complete it?
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Okay we can complete it
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*

07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 079 3505: We are on stage 03
07/12/23, 2:16 pm - Arshita: No, we have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explaing stage 5 and 6 to you
07/12/23, 2:16 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
07/12/23, 2:16 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
07/12/23, 2:16 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
07/12/23, 2:16 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
07/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes I am clear.
07/12/23, 7:23 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

Are you ready for the same?
08/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes I am ready.

08/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: It is good to connect with you today! 

I hope you are doing well!
08/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: May I know did you managed to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
08/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yeah I am doing well.
08/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes I discussed the program with my family.
08/12/23, 12:21 pm - Arshita: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 079 3505: We concluded that learning through the Edoofa scholarship will help me acquire higher education that allows me to gain experience whilst learning as well.
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - Arshita: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! So may I know if your family has any questions for me?
08/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 079 3505: No they do not have questions.
08/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: That is fine. 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
08/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 079 3505: My mother is a single parent, so the cost of education might be too high for her to afford.
08/12/23, 12:32 pm - Arshita: Regarding the financial concern, have you considered the payment plan for the enrollment fees?
08/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes we have... But the period is too short for her to raise funds according to what she earns.
08/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: As per your understanding how much is the cost of education and by when do you need to pay if found eligible?
08/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Registration fee is too expensive and program fee is also expensive. I will pay when my mother has  adequate funds if I am eligible.
08/12/23, 12:50 pm - Arshita: Nicole, I do understand the financial challenges but then I was asking as per your understanding how much is the registration fee and enrollment fee and what is the timeframe in which you have to pay if found eligible.
08/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 079 3505: As per my understanding, registration fee is $500 to $1000 and enrollment is $350.
First part of registration will be in August 2024  and remaining in January 2025
Enrollment is paid in 7days and the remaining $150 in the next 30 days.
08/12/23, 1:49 pm - Arshita: Let me help you gain a better understanding of the registration fee. The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
08/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Okay thank you
08/12/23, 1:52 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear now.
08/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yeah I am clear
08/12/23, 1:54 pm - Arshita: Will this be feasible for your family?
08/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes they will make a plan.
08/12/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
08/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Alright.
08/12/23, 1:56 pm - Arshita: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career,
08/12/23, 1:56 pm - Arshita: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

2.India

3.Average cost is $15000

4.Around $2200

5.Enrollment is $350 and is paid in 7 days

It helps to access higher education at an affordable fee. The Earn While You Learn program helps to assist underprivileged people like me. It helps to provide employment to future leaders. The program helps to learn skills before employment at firms.
13/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 079 3505: 7.Yes l am clear about the same.

14/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 531 4312: Yes and I think 30 days is a short period

I got a bit occupied at a Board meeting due to which I was unable to get back to you. Are you available now?
15/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Yes I am available
15/12/23, 12:18 pm - Austin: May I ask, how much time will you require to raise the first part of the enrollment fee($200)?
16/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 531 4312: I need about 4 months
16/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 079 3505: Greetings!
18/12/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: That is a long time frame by which the seats will be full, therefore I advise you to discuss as a family and with your relatives so that you can find a way out to raise the enrollment fee if your child is found eligible, will you be able to do so?
