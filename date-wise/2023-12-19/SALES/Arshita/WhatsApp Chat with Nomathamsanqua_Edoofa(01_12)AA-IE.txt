01/12/23, 6:57 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
01/12/23, 7:44 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *10:30 am CAT on Saturday(02/12/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

04/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 067 8685: No I haven't applied to any university abroad it's my first time applying to Edoofa scholarship

Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
04/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Currently I haven't researched but I will
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students

05/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Studying in India would implement a positive impact in my career in many ways .Since India is a large and diverse country with a rich cultural and social history,this could provide me with a wealth of knowledge and experiences to draw from in my career during my study.According to the information that you gave me about India it is clear that India is  home to some of the top universities in the world.If I study in India  I will also have the opportunity to learn from some of the leading experts in the field that I would be studying .Studying in India could help me build connections with other sociologists from around the world, which can be a benefit for my future career.
05/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
05/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 067 8685: I can aim to achieve my career aspirations by studying in India in different ways for instance .I can take advantage of any internship or work experience opportunities offered by the university that I would be studying at .By doing so it will give me valuable experience in my field of study .I would also network with other students , professors, professionals  who are in the same field like me  because I believe these connections can be of great help during my studies.
05/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 067 8685: No I don't
05/12/23, 1:12 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/12/23, 1:12 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 1:12 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
05/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 067 8685: It is not 🫢
05/12/23, 1:19 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
05/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Yes
05/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
05/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
05/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
05/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.

05/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Arshita: Please answer this <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Yes
05/12/23, 4:01 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
05/12/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Noted
05/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Yes
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
05/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 067 8685: The first point
05/12/23, 4:16 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

09/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 067 8685: Yes ma'am
09/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 067 8685: How are you
09/12/23, 11:35 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
09/12/23, 11:35 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
09/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 067 8685: My aunt
09/12/23, 11:37 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
09/12/23, 11:37 am - Arshita: You can add your aunt to the group as well
09/12/23, 11:38 am - ~ Amor💙❄️✨ added +263 71 238 4178 and +263 77 265 6290
09/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 067 8685: They are happy and they hope I pass with higher grades if am given the chance to study abroad and they are also willing to help me with things that I might need
09/12/23, 11:46 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
09/12/23, 11:46 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
09/12/23, 11:46 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 067 8685: 🙏🏼
09/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 067 8685: I knew about the application form ...oh is the process difficult
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: Our admissions team will be helping you with it.
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
09/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 067 8685: Ohh this makes it easy to apply
09/12/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
09/12/23, 11:55 am - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 067 8685: Ok I understand
09/12/23, 11:58 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
09/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 067 8685: What if we fail to raise $350 within 7 days in Phase 1 ?
09/12/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: You can pay in installment that is $200 in 7 days and remaining $150 in 30 days
09/12/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Ok thanks
09/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
09/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 067 8685: We have discussed all stages so far
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Arshita: No, we have discussed till enrollment which is stage 4.

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Ohh
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 067 8685: Yes I am
09/12/23, 1:09 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
09/12/23, 1:09 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Arshita and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
10/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 238 4178: We do appreciate that your fees are indeed low suppose  the enrolment tym comes we don't hv the money and u v found our child eligible wat happens. Cn u deal with other organisations which may like to sponsor or make long payment plans than those u hv stated
10/12/23, 5:04 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, @263712384178 

I hope you are doing well
10/12/23, 5:04 pm - Austin: May I know, are you finding the enrollment fee as a challenge?
10/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 238 4178: Yes we are civil servants kkkkk and  u know hw we struggle
10/12/23, 5:12 pm - Austin: Absolutely, I am aware of the conditions
10/12/23, 5:12 pm - Austin: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
10/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 238 4178: True that
10/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 238 4178: That's y l started with appreciating u guys
10/12/23, 5:21 pm - Austin: As per your understanding, how much is the enrollment fee for the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
10/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 71 238 4178: The understanding of an old age guess u said $350
10/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 238 4178: For December enrollment and $750 for January
10/12/23, 5:34 pm - Austin: That is right, but the enrollment fee is to be paid only once if the child qualifies, have you considered the payment plan for the enrollment fees?
10/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 238 4178: Which one ? The one for 200 in 7 dys and 150 in 30 dys
10/12/23, 6:02 pm - Austin: That is right, is this plan feasible for you and family?
10/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 238 4178: The fees and the plan is not bad at all we r still yet to discuss as a family coz this is our first child to go beyond O level
10/12/23, 6:32 pm - Austin: I understand, so when are you planning to host the discussions?

10/12/23, 7:00 pm - Austin: If your child qualifies, the due date for the first part ($200) , will fall this month itself and the remaining in January
10/12/23, 7:00 pm - Austin: Are you comfortable with the same?
11/12/23, 1:07 pm - Austin: Good Day to you all!
How are you doing?
11/12/23, 1:08 pm - Austin: I am still looking forward to hearing from you, let me know if there are any challenges
