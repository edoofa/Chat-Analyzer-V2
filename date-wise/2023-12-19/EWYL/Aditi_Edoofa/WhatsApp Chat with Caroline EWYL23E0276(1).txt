10/08/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Caroline EWYL23E0276 '
10/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 994 5161: Yes mam l understand

10/08/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Perfect!
10/08/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*. <This message was edited>

And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. The icing on the cake?
