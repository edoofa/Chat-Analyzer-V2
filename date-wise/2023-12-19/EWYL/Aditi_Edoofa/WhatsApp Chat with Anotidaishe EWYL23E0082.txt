16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Anotidaishe!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:27 am - +267 74 581 706: Good morning. Thank you l would opt for afternoon sessions.

How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
22/09/23, 3:07 pm - +267 74 581 706: Hallo
22/09/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here.

 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
22/09/23, 3:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would request you to be on time for the next session.
22/09/23, 3:19 pm - +267 74 581 706: Ok thank you
25/09/23, 2:31 pm - +267 74 581 706: Yes pleaae
25/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It is wonderful to have you back. Before we start the session could you briefly walk us through the two core objectives of the EWYL program?
25/09/23, 2:43 pm - +267 74 581 706: To help students acquire skill thsn enable them to fit the job market and to to help finance their education
25/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Anotidaishe is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
25/09/23, 2:49 pm - +267 74 581 706: Noted
25/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
25/09/23, 2:56 pm - +267 74 581 706: Thank you
25/09/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
25/09/23, 3:04 pm - +267 74 581 706: Thank you have a blessed day
26/09/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Tuesday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
26/09/23, 2:20 pm - +267 74 581 706: I am fine . Good afternoon
26/09/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
26/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 2:30 pm - +267 74 581 706: I am done
26/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope to see Anotidaishe also earning a lot of credits like this.
26/09/23, 2:34 pm - +267 74 581 706: Yes sir
26/09/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
26/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I would like to mention that I am a female so I would appreciate it if you would address me as Ms. Aditi or ma'am.
26/09/23, 2:35 pm - +267 74 581 706: Ok noted
26/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Anotidaishe* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
26/09/23, 2:48 pm - +267 74 581 706: When will be that
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
26/09/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once she forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

04/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming our session.
-At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Anotidaishe*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Anotidaishe* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
04/10/23, 2:31 pm - +267 74 581 706: Alright
04/10/23, 2:31 pm - +267 74 581 706: Noted
04/10/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that he will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
04/10/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 2:46 pm - +267 74 581 706: Ok will do that
04/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Anotidaishe can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things she is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
04/10/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.

Let’s begin with today's session.
06/10/23, 2:27 pm - +267 74 581 706: Alright
06/10/23, 2:28 pm - +267 74 581 706: Please note that next week l wont be able to attend these session as l will be invigilating exams

06/10/23, 2:46 pm - +267 74 581 706: Will it not disturb her main reason for going to the University that is to study her modules of law
06/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: No @26774581706 I will also make sure that she focuses on her Academics fully and score good grades there.
06/10/23, 2:55 pm - +267 74 581 706: But l dont really understand. Is it not suppose to be by choice that a student chooses to do EWYL or not
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, it can be.
The EWYL Program has been very beneficial for our students and we do not give time-consuming projects to our students to make sure that they focus on their academics also we aim to make our students job-ready by teaching them 21st century skills and also one your child is in India we would pick her up from the airport and escort her to her university and she would be taken care of here in India as we have our team members who are their in their University campus to make sure that our students are safe and are not facing any challenges.
06/10/23, 3:22 pm - +267 74 581 706: Alright
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - +267 74 581 706: I think the student  would be the right person to choose sessions days suitable for her
06/10/23, 3:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, agreed but she can also change it if the batch days doesn't fit her schedule.
06/10/23, 3:55 pm - +267 74 581 706: Ok
06/10/23, 3:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:

How are you doing?

As it is almost the end of the year let's go down the memory lane upon the amazing *Africa visit by Edoofa's visionary CEOs, Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen!*💫

Their trip across Africa has been nothing short of amazing, filled with enriching experiences, cultural discoveries, and meaningful connections. On this trip, we gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape the future of Edoofa and further enhance the opportunities offered to our students.🚀

Thank you for being a part of the Edoofa family. We can't wait to share more about this unforgettable African expedition!💐
