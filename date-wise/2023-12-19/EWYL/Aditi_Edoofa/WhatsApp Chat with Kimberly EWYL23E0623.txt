22/09/23, 9:49 am - +27 62 323 6383: Good morning
22/09/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
22/09/23, 12:12 pm - +27 62 323 6383: Good afternoon Kimberly is at school at the moment phones are not allowed til she finishes exam think in November she won't be ava
22/09/23, 12:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
22/09/23, 12:27 pm - +27 62 323 6383: Am the father Kimberly at school
22/09/23, 12:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand Sir, I hope that you would be available to complete these sessions on Kimberly's behalf as it is just a matter of 3 days.

22/09/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great.
22/09/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we will resume our session Monday onwards from *8:30 AM to 9:30 AM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
22/09/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Wishing you a wonderful weekend ahead.

How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
26/09/23, 8:46 am - +27 62 323 6383: Am good and u
26/09/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well
Thanks for asking
26/09/23, 8:47 am - +27 62 323 6383: That's good
26/09/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope you were able to go through the video.
26/09/23, 8:50 am - +27 62 323 6383: Yes l did
26/09/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope you got an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with Kimberly.
26/09/23, 8:51 am - +27 62 323 6383: Yes l did
26/09/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
Before we start the session could you briefly walk us through the two core objectives of the EWYL program?
26/09/23, 8:55 am - +27 62 323 6383: To educate and to empower you to be successful in your preferred trade
26/09/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Kimberly* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
26/09/23, 8:58 am - +27 62 323 6383: That's great news
26/09/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
26/09/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 9:02 am - +27 62 323 6383: Yes l read
26/09/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope that one day Kimberly will also earn credits like this.
26/09/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
26/09/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/09/23, 9:05 am - +27 62 323 6383: Ok
26/09/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates her to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
26/09/23, 9:08 am - +27 62 323 6383: Ok noted
26/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once she forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

26/09/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Kimberly's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that her academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure she is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
26/09/23, 9:29 am - +27 62 323 6383: Thank u
26/09/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that she will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
You can go through it later when you are free Sir.
26/09/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.

How are you doing?

As it is almost the end of the year let's go down the memory lane upon the amazing *Africa visit by Edoofa's visionary CEOs, Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen!*💫

Their trip across Africa has been nothing short of amazing, filled with enriching experiences, cultural discoveries, and meaningful connections. On this trip, we gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape the future of Edoofa and further enhance the opportunities offered to our students.🚀

Thank you for being a part of the Edoofa family. We can't wait to share more about this unforgettable African expedition!💐
