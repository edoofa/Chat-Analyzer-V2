15/09/23, 9:32 pm - +260 95 3025773: Dear mentor, my name is Mebelo Mebelo, the father to Mendai Mebelo. Mendai's EWYL group is Mendai EWYL23E0611. The counselling session has been completed with the Admissions Team. However, Mendai is unable to join thd group due to restrictions to phones at his school. However, as his father I am ready to proceed with the session if fine with you.

16/09/23, 9:57 am - +260 95 3025773: Good morning. Noted, thank you very much.
16/09/23, 10:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Menadi's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for Mendai's application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about from his counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of his application, particularly *his desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest.
16/09/23, 10:03 am - +260 95 3025773: Glad you have the information about Mendai.
16/09/23, 10:24 am - +260 95 3025773: Morning Ms Aditi. It is our pleasure to have you as the mentor for Mendai.

16/09/23, 12:56 pm - +260 95 3025773: I am available
16/09/23, 12:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that is great!
16/09/23, 12:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you and have a good day sir!
16/09/23, 12:59 pm - +260 95 3025773: Thank you very much. Wishing you a great day and fruitful coming week.

19/09/23, 1:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings
Hope you are well.

I apologize for not being able to take your session due to a prior commitment to address a personal matter.
Thank you for understanding.
19/09/23, 1:25 pm - +260 97 8108842: Afternoon. We are doing fine. Hope you are alright too. It is understood.
19/09/23, 1:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you.
We will resume sessions tomorrow and I can for you schedule them for Wednesday Thursday and Friday!

20/09/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I hope you are doing really well.

 So, are you ready to start our session?
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - +260 97 8108842: Afternoon. We can start.
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @260978108842 I have actually changed the timings of the session to 2:00 to 3:00 PM, I hope that it's fine with you?
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 8108842: Time is fine.
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that is great!
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 8108842: You can shed some more light. However, the objectives are basically ensuring that Mendai gets connected to high quality universities and also give an opportunity to understand what the various universities have on offer.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 2:31 pm - +260 97 8108842: It is clear. Thanks for the refresher.
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 8108842: This is quite encouraging. I have read through the email.
20/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope Mendai will also earn good amount of credits in the future.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - +260 97 8108842: Absolutely. He is really determined to do so.
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted, and thanks a lot. Looking forward to more interaction with the team.
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure Sir!
20/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days
20/09/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
20/09/23, 3:03 pm - +260 97 8108842: Thanks a lot. Wishing you a fruitful day.
21/09/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
21/09/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 8108842: We are alright. Yes I am are.
21/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Mendai forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

22/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 95 3025773: Afternoon
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 95 3025773: We are alright. Hope you are too.
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 95 3025773: We can begin
22/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am good.
Thanks.
22/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Mendai's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure Mendai is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
22/09/23, 2:40 pm - +260 95 3025773: Great! Points taken.
22/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Mendai will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
22/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
22/09/23, 3:11 pm - +260 95 3025773: Thank you very much. Looking forward to the session on Monday. Still reading through the EWYL Doc you sent esrlier on. Enjoy yiur weekend.
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Mendai can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things Mendai is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Mendai is back, he is supposed to note a few things.

Either you can make the decision on his behalf, or he can be active for a few minutes in the session and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once he is back from school.
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To choose a batch for the sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
25/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: He will be back home early December 2023 when schools close. He will be available from then onwards.
25/09/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 8108842: Monday and Thursday would be fine.
25/09/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 8108842: Sessions requiring his participation will only be possible once schools close in December
25/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 8108842: Noted
25/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 8108842: Otherwise we are good to continue
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted.
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All the conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

25/09/23, 2:49 pm - +260 97 8108842: Given that he is not around till December 2023 what is your guidance?
25/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.

1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Which course would you like to study?

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class ( L6/ U6/ A Level Appeared):

I will be appearing for my A Level (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
06/12/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 8532307: Understood
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MENDAI/ADITI*
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

06/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 8532307: Noted
06/12/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/12/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
06/12/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
06/12/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
06/12/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare.

06/12/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 8532307: It talks about a project called the African school education reform mission.

Lastly, he/she can ask them if the would like to setup an online meeting with the edoofa programme director.
If yes, he/she can then proceed by sharing the principals details the his/her mentor
06/12/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have. However I’ll explain this project quickly for you in 2 steps:  I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?

07/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/12/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

07/12/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
