12/08/23, 8:34 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
12/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam thank you very much

12/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 452 3583: yes maam l did very much
12/08/23, 8:41 am - +91 78273 08969: Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you could be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.
12/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 452 3583: okay okay maam l would like to say l do agree with the time being and have no quiries about it
12/08/23, 8:50 am - +91 78273 08969: It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
12/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam well understood on that one
12/08/23, 9:17 am - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam .....no l do not understand what you two objectives are
12/08/23, 9:36 am - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
12/08/23, 10:48 am - +263 71 452 3583: okay Maam thank you for outlining the these goals l have clearly understood them
12/08/23, 10:52 am - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/08/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 452 3583: thank you maam for the introductions lm glad to know about the team
12/08/23, 10:56 am - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Bruce?
12/08/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 452 3583: thats sounding very inspiring lm glad maam to knoe your very motivating goals towards my career
12/08/23, 10:59 am - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
12/08/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam that is great l really appreciate the effort l really do understand the program structure and it sounds very interesting indeed
12/08/23, 11:06 am - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/08/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 452 3583: okay that is great maam l will be glad to receive them
12/08/23, 11:10 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

14/08/23, 1:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
14/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 452 3583: sure thing maam each and every section has its own interests as for me l liked most the first part that was talking about success as it comes from teamwork for there is noone who cam achieve a goal on her own and also the second part that was talking about breaking large goals into everyday small steps only to mention a few
14/08/23, 1:38 pm - +91 78273 08969: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
14/08/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 452 3583: sure maam that is great and every student's wish to be mentioned above and to be selected amongst the few for sure
14/08/23, 1:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
14/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam sure you can go ahead and ask
14/08/23, 1:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
14/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 452 3583: 1. Starting with You Ms Tenzin as my mentor, Ms Deepalu is the department Heard as well as our group conversation monitor and Ms Davi our head coaching
2.The first goal is to make sure that all edoofians have equal opportunity and the second one is to help all edoofians self finance their education and this is acheived through the earn while you learn program 
3.A
4. A Hall of inspiration according to my own understanding is a small remarking script that the Founder write recommending any students in our team of any good work that he or she has done recently to encourage others
14/08/23, 1:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: Bruce, It is Ms. Deepali, not Deepalu.
14/08/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam lm sorry about that
14/08/23, 1:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

23/08/23, 2:17 pm - +91 78273 08969: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
23/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam l got that
23/08/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam go ahead sure
23/08/23, 2:21 pm - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
23/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam l got it
23/08/23, 2:23 pm - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
23/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay Maam sounds very interesting abd very thoughtful indeed
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
23/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay okay maam l got you on that one
23/08/23, 2:28 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 452 3583: noted maam
23/08/23, 2:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay Maam l fet that
23/08/23, 3:01 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
23/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 452 3583: well received maam thank you

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.

28/08/23, 3:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and I believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
28/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 452 3583: very excited and can't wait to hear them
28/08/23, 3:20 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
28/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 452 3583: sure maam lm following
28/08/23, 4:01 pm - +91 78273 08969: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.

2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

29/08/23, 1:56 pm - +91 78273 08969: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- You will have your sessions on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.
29/08/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 452 3583: thank you maam  l. really glad
29/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam thank you very much for the updates

29/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam lm following
29/08/23, 2:18 pm - +91 78273 08969: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

29/08/23, 2:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
29/08/23, 2:27 pm - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam lm following that too
29/08/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: Do let me know when you are done with this.
29/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 452 3583: lm done maam
29/08/23, 2:47 pm - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
29/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam l did understand that l wanted also to know if this text has time or l will do it any minute
29/08/23, 2:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: You can do it every morning and make it a habit.
29/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 452 3583: okay maam l got it
29/08/23, 2:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
29/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 452 3583: sure maam u have make it clear and l did understand
29/08/23, 3:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discuss and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
