How are you doing?

As it is almost the end of the year let's go down the memory lane upon the amazing *Africa visit by Edoofa's visionary CEOs, Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen!*💫

Their trip across Africa has been nothing short of amazing, filled with enriching experiences, cultural discoveries, and meaningful connections. On this trip, we gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape the future of Edoofa and further enhance the opportunities offered to our students.🚀

Thank you for being a part of the Edoofa family. We can't wait to share more about this unforgettable African expedition!💐
