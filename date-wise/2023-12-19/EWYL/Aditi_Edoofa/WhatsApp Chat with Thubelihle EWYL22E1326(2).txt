You have won the Grant challenge! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the grant letter for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
14/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Happy holidayy
14/08/23, 3:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!

16/08/23, 11:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 351 8025: I am ready
16/08/23, 1:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 1:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the late reply as I was caught up in a meeting.
16/08/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Its alright🙂
16/08/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 351 8025: This is empowering😁😁😁
16/08/23, 1:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, thank you.
16/08/23, 1:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Yes i am😁
16/08/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 351 8025: May i ask,do the EWYL sessions have marks?
16/08/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 351 8025: I have never seen my marks
16/08/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Secondly, please check my credit score for me dear.
16/08/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, your attendance in the sessions is also considered.
16/08/23, 1:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's $4 till now.
16/08/23, 1:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Ohhhhh alright.

16/08/23, 3:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 351 8025: My Apologies Ms Aditi. I am sorry <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?

27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like to congratulate you as you have already earned around $200 worth of scholarship credits surpassing your grant amount.🚀 <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?

27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Yes ma'am

29/11/23, 3:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it. <This message was edited>

09/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Ohhhh
09/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 351 8025: I am trying to find students but no one is willing to come ma'am
09/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Plus it is even more difficult to do the project because the students I knew and communicated with are currently in university. I do not know any that were A level this year. The few that i could find had financial problems or were not willing to come to India. So it is very difficult but I am trying
09/12/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Any particular issue that they might be facing?
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Mostly it is financial problems or some have different plans for their higher education.
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so in this case try to get contact of your juniors they all have given the examinations od their A level, now.
09/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Yes i tried but they said they were not in contact with other students that were doing A level for example in groups. I'm trying my best ma'am but it is difficult
09/12/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand, so may I know if you took help from your parents regarding this because they are back there and they can also help you out in this, right?
09/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Yes I am taking help but they live in Tsholotsho which is a rural area. Most students over there are financially unstable. They had wishes to come but they stated that they can barely afford 500USD. That's the problem. <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
Maybe anyone in your extended family or cousins who can help you out on this?
09/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Yes i am trying to get help also
09/12/23, 3:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
09/12/23, 3:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 3:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 351 8025: 1. Webinar
2. Webinar
3. It's still unclear ma'am since its difficult to find people
09/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 351 8025: So we choose which one to use between the grant and the project. We cannot use both right?
09/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 351 8025: Even if both were done well you will still use 1 not both?
09/12/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Noted, that's great that you have a sense of clarity.
09/12/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, for now you can redeem your scholarship credits, okay?
09/12/23, 3:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, whichever is higher.
09/12/23, 3:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So we are concluding this session with an amazing Saturday Activity that aims to acquaint us with Microsoft Excel, a potent tool for sorting and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a simple yet useful exercise: crafting a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Start Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, any available spreadsheet software will suffice.
Set Up Columns: Establish three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities: Recall your activities from the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.
Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.
Calculate Average Time: Utilize Excel functions to find the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect: Allocate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll enhance these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you face any challenges. Let's delve into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
