04/08/23, 9:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay I understand, but try to inform me if any such thing happens in future.

I hope that you are well.

Please excuse me for being unable to take your session today as I went to the airport to receive our Proud Edoofians. I am indeed overjoyed to have the privilege of mentoring such exceptional students. Witnessing their joyful and enthusiastic expressions after their lengthy journey was a truly heartwarming experience.❤️
07/08/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 238 1169: Morning morning we understand you are ever busy.  Thanks for the update.

08/08/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Mutsawashe
Hope that you are doing well.

Let's begin with our today's discussions🚀
08/08/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am good.
Thanks for asking.
08/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 300 1210: Yes
08/08/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 300 1210: No. What are they
08/08/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
08/08/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
08/08/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in your assigned time slot.
So we will start tomorrow with a bang and make this journey super amazing.
08/08/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 300 1210: Okay thank u
09/08/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 300 1210: Thank you. Have a blessed day

10/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 300 1210: And a quote by the author
10/08/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 300 1210: Master your circumstances rather than be ruled by them
10/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, that's amazing.
10/08/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
10/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 300 1210: Yes. I would love to
10/08/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Mutsawashe?
10/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 300 1210: This sounds great.
10/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 300 1210: I hope we achieve all goals

10/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 300 1210: I will do so
10/08/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in your allotted time slot.

25/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 300 1210: Okay.
25/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 300 1210: Noted
25/08/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
25/08/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
25/08/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 300 1210: Great
25/08/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
25/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 300 1210: Yes.
25/08/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MUTSAWASHE/ADITI/25AUG23* <This message was edited>
25/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 300 1210: Yes
25/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
25/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
25/08/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
25/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 300 1210: Okay
25/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 300 1210: 📝noting down

25/08/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
25/08/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

25/08/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
25/08/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: It has already been communicated with you.

Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

12/09/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
12/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am still waiting for your response on the other two questions.
12/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 300 1210: 2. *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
So I am hoping students from your school would like to be a part of this great community
12/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 300 1210: 3. My school is located in Harare province
12/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
12/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well. <This message was edited>
12/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
12/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 300 1210: I am in the process to get it. People are experiencing network problems. I guess that's what is holding my contact back
12/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 300 1210: The school I am to connect you with is in Mashonaland East province
12/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, but I am happy that you are working towards it.
12/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
12/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Yes I am doing my best
12/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Okay
12/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

13/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
13/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Okay. Noted
13/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
13/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Okay
13/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Following

14/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

14/09/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!

I am not aware of these
14/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.

*SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
14/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Okay
14/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Thank you
14/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
14/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Okay. I will do that
14/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.

19/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Yes ma'am
19/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
19/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Mutsawashe, I hope everything is clear till now?
19/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Yes. Everything is clear <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
19/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
19/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
19/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
19/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Yes maam
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now your session is on Monday and Thursday from 12:00-1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions

▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
19/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Yes maam. I will do so
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Yes ma'am I will do my best.
19/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 300 1210: If not for the academic pressure I would have completed a project or 2. But I will try as much as I can to put more effort and time on my projects
19/09/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, but I would want you to outshine your past performance and perform well and earn lots of credits and make me and your parents proud!
19/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 300 1210: Yes maam. I will do my best
19/09/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
