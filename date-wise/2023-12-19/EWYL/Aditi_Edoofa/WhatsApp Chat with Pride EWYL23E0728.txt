10/10/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
10/10/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Dear Parent,
It is wonderful to have you back. Before we start the session could you briefly walk us through the two core objectives of the EWYL program?
10/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Program aim to have students who should be teachable and open minded 
2.students should follow instructions
10/10/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Pride* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
10/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well explained  and been refreshed am following  and jotting down my notes, we may  go ahead
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Pride's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for her application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback from her counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of her application, particularly her desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share something about myself through this video so that you can be rest assured that your child is in responsible hands …
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
12/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes quality education equal joi opportunities
12/10/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Kudzai* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
12/10/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees.

12/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well understood, learning and earning to sustain or fund the same
12/10/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
12/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
12/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
12/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I would like to observe their presence with great appreciation, thank you
12/10/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for expressing your appreciation. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Pride* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
12/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I do understand the mandate ma'am   , Pride is at school school and it will be difficult for her to connect.They are currently rounding up revisions at school.l stand to be guided
12/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand!
12/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Pride* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Pride* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
13/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am following madam and l like the opportunities to finance self that great

13/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Pride* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
13/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here.

16/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
16/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Pride has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.

16/10/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
16/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help her to fund her higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
16/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.

24/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 104 6384: Sounds exciting
24/11/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 104 6384: So after they fill this form they should submit this to me or I refer them to your number
24/11/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay so after they fill this form they will submit it to you and then you will share it with me in this EWYL group.
24/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 104 6384: And when is the due date😅
24/11/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: There is no due date Pride, you can do this project even when you come to India as also I would like to tell you that the students earn the highest from this project and our Edoofians who are here in India have earned more than $4000 worth of scholarship credits majority being from this project.
24/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 104 6384: Wow !
24/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes! It is indeed amazing.
24/11/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/11/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*PRIDE/ADITI*
24/11/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/11/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
24/11/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
24/11/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 104 6384: So on this case is it okay to communicate with them in my indigenous language😅
24/11/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would appreciate that if you use the English Language.
24/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 104 6384: So first I create a group that has you and one student or it's more than one student
24/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 104 6384: What if their questioning is in indigenous language
24/11/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: More than one student.
24/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 104 6384: Noted
24/11/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright, there is nothing like you cannot use your language you surely can, okay?
24/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 104 6384: Sure
24/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 104 6384: I didn't understand on what you meant when you said divisions
24/11/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: As in sections in your batch.
24/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 104 6384: Sorry for the delay 
The network is down
24/11/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: I understand!

24/11/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 104 6384: I understand
24/11/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
24/11/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
24/11/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 104 6384: Thank you
24/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
24/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 104 6384: I will start the project immediately
24/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
24/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
24/11/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
24/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare.

This is indeed very helpful 
I will definitely utilize it

29/11/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
29/11/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
29/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 104 6384: I am still going through it

30/11/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
