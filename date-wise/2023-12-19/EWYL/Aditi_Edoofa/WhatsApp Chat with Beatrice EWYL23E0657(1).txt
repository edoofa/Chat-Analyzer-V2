Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest.

So, are you ready to start our session?
03/10/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Beatrice, I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
03/10/23, 9:45 am - +260 97 8980318: Good morning thank you
03/10/23, 9:46 am - +260 97 8980318: Beatrice is in boarding school and has no access to her phone  at the moment.
03/10/23, 9:47 am - +260 97 8980318: We had indicated that sessions that need her personally to respond can only begin after her exams which end on the 25 of November 2023. 
Kindly guide how we will proceed 🙏
03/10/23, 9:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Understood. In this situation, @~Chileshe, you should have informed me prior but no problems. You can complete these orientation sessions on behalf of Beatrice.
03/10/23, 9:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope you would be available from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM.

04/10/23, 8:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Beatrice!
How are you?

Are you ready to begin the session?
04/10/23, 8:30 am - +260 97 8980318: Good morning
04/10/23, 8:31 am - +260 97 8980318: Ready
04/10/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
04/10/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met.
04/10/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Beatrice* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
04/10/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
04/10/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 8980318: Well noted
04/10/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 8980318: Interesting
04/10/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
04/10/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
04/10/23, 9:13 am - +260 97 8980318: Nice to meet you all 🙏
04/10/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Likewise, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Beatrice* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
04/10/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's time to wrap up today's session
04/10/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
04/10/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 8980318: Thank you . Good day to you all 🙏
05/10/23, 8:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning!
I trust you're in excellent condition.

So, are you prepared to commence our session?
05/10/23, 8:45 am - +260 97 8980318: Good morning, ready
05/10/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
05/10/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Beatrice* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

05/10/23, 9:03 am - +260 97 8980318: Lovely 😊
05/10/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Beatrice*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Beatrice* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
05/10/23, 9:07 am - +260 97 8980318: Well noted
05/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Beatrice* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same. <This message was edited>

09/10/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that she has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
09/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
09/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help her to fund her higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
09/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.

How are you doing?

As it is almost the end of the year let's go down the memory lane upon the amazing *Africa visit by Edoofa's visionary CEOs, Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen!*💫

Their trip across Africa has been nothing short of amazing, filled with enriching experiences, cultural discoveries, and meaningful connections. On this trip, we gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape the future of Edoofa and further enhance the opportunities offered to our students.🚀

Thank you for being a part of the Edoofa family. We can't wait to share more about this unforgettable African expedition!💐

I hope you are doing well.

This week, I will share with you your *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*
