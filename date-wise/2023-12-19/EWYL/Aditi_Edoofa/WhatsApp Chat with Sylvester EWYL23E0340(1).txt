I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

Hope that you are well.

Please excuse me for the delay in your session as I was facing some technical issues with my device.
May we begin with our session?
07/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Greetings  Ms Aditi, no problem lets begin our session
07/08/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
07/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Not sure, what are these two objectives
07/08/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
07/08/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
07/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 024 8736: I understand now, thank you
07/08/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! So can you please share your understanding with me, so that I can make sure that we are on the same page.
07/08/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Well, as you said we Edoofians need to learn 21st century skills, which l think include: leadership, information and media literacy, ethical decision making, creativity etc. Then helping our parents by decreasing the costs of education by EWYL program which will be reducing the tution costs of the university.
07/08/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome Sylvester, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
07/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you Ms Aditi, I'm sure we'll make a great team
07/08/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Sylvester.
08/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I am very happy to see your excitement.
08/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey
You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
08/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Noted Ms Aditi
08/08/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
08/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 024 8736: I'm glad you understand my situation Ms Aditi. Let's focus on EWYL journey, understanding is import!!

09/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Greetings Ms Aditi

So what l learned from this Newsletter is about small steps, which was the main idea.
Benefits of taking small steps is that they're achievable for example: lf we were tell a young kid to lift up a 10kg sack of balls to a certain location, it would even demotivate the kid to even start the task. Whereas if the kid was to divide the balls into sacks it would encourage/ motivate him to start the task. So small steps can lead to huge success in life.

So, are you ready to start our session?
04/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 024 8736: Morning Ms Aditi

So on the previous doc : EWYL projects. I understood that one needs to be aware of the the business world, what the future business would look like, and also what it takes to to involve yourself in these future jobs.

Some of the important skills that are required are digital skills and literacy, remote team work etc. In brief one needs to have strong online n technology skills because the world is evolving and we also have to adapt with it. 



Then about Project 1 l understood that

One has to do research on  companies online, then identity the decision makers in these organizations and reach out to them with an offer, after acceptance from these organizations one has to share Edoofa's message with them. Then finally one has to report through the entire activity by creating a Google sheet where all the record of the entire project will be recorded.
04/09/23, 8:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know what Sylvester, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it. <This message was edited>
04/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 024 8736: Then Project 2: Community building

Well it's all about sharing the message of Edoofa in our environment/ area with either relatives, friends or anyone who's interested in the Edoofian scholarship program. 
So communication skills are required there/ social interaction.
04/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you Ms Aditi
04/09/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
04/09/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
04/09/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you, l'll Ms Aditi
04/09/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
04/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 024 8736: Everything is well understood, 

1.Reach out to local people and spread the message.

2. Creating a LinkedIn account which allows one to search, and reach out companies. If they're interested one will setup a meeting so that the Edoofian team will further explain the aspects of the alliance.


By doing all this, l'll be gaining professional network skills, industrial exposure and enhancing credibility.

11/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 024 8736: I don't think company 3 falls under the types we discussed
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, You are right!
The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.

27/09/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello!
I hope you are doing well

So, are you ready to start our session
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Good afternoon Ms Aditi, yes l'm ready
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope everything is clear till this point.
27/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Yes everything's well understood
27/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Yes l am, Ms Aditi
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are certain ways
*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Sylvester/Aditi/27Sept23*
27/09/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/09/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you that is understood, Ms Aditi
27/09/23, 3:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Our daily exploration comes to a close for today

Thank you for being a part of this daily session. 
Rest well, and let's reconvene tomorrow with fresh perspectives and renewed enthusiasm
27/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you, have a nice day Ms Aditi
30/09/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
30/09/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 024 8736: Good morning Ms Aditi

Yes we may start
30/09/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great, Sylvester!
30/09/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: So I hope that everything is clear till this point as we will be continuing from here.
30/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 024 8736: Yes Ms Aditi.
30/09/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
30/09/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: So let's resume with the other step that would be to ADD YOUR MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
30/09/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 024 8736: That is well understood Ms Aditi

06/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Noted Ms Aditi!
06/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
16/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you Ms Aditi, l'll update you as l get the contact
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
16/11/23, 3:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively as I trust you recognize how valuable the EWYL session is. <This message was edited>

20/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
20/11/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through it.
20/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Yes l've gone through everything Ms Aditi. l don have any questions in mind.
20/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Now that we're done with our EWYL, may l know if u'll be still available in case l face some challenges. I didn't do most of the things because of exam pressure.Will you still be available
20/11/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
20/11/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
20/11/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
20/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Yes Ms Aditi l'm very much exicited
20/11/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 024 8736: That's very beneficial especially this era Ms Aditi. l'm following
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Yes Ms Aditi,  l'm aware of them, expect SEO not sure what you're referring to
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
20/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Thank you Ms Aditi, if u may brief me on that please, how will l improve the quality of Search engine

2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

21/11/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
21/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 024 8736: I've decided. Monday and Thurday
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted!
21/11/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Noted Ms Aditi, thank you
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 024 8736: Noted Ms Aditi, thank you very much
21/11/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
21/11/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sylvester, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
21/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 024 8736: l'll surely do Ms Aditi, thank you.
23/11/23, 9:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263780248736
