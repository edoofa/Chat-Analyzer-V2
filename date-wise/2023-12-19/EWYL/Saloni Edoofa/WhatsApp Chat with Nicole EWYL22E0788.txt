24/12/22, 12:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa created group "Nicole EWYL22E0788"
24/12/22, 12:21 pm - You were added
08/08/23, 9:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Nicole and parents!
How are you?

I have noted that, thank you.
15/09/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 243 6394: Good day. Nicole is unable to attend the sessions at the moment. She is writing her last exam on the 15th of November.

I will only be able to attend the sessions from   2000hrs.
19/09/23, 12:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
22/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 243 6394: Good day
22/09/23, 12:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Nicole can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 243 6394: Understood. I am answering on behalf of Nicole.
22/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I understand that.
22/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
22/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 243 6394: I think it's best for Nicole to proceed with the sessions when she is through with her exams. She'll be available from the 16th of November.
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, of course
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: These are just basic formalities that needs to be performed.
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 243 6394: I am a proud Edoofian
22/09/23, 1:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Follow this on the EWYL Line and share this message as well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

▪️We will start by discussing all the projects in depth from the beginning.
▪️ Every day, you must come on the EWYL Line and follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian'.

20/11/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Nicole,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

21/11/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Nicole, I last shared the project audio for the thrid project which is the African School Reform Mission Project. Can you share what you understood from it?
21/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 815 1615: I understood that the project is about reaching to local schools and inform them about Edoofa program
It is about connecting with the principals and telling them why I joined Edoofa
After everything I am supposed to ask them if they would like to setup a meeting with the director of Edoofa.
21/11/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?

21/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 815 1615: 1 Regina Mundi High School
It is connected with Edoofa
21/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 815 1615: 2 I do not have the messages
21/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 815 1615: 3 Midlands province
21/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: I have noted that information.
21/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
21/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
21/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 815 1615: I do not have right now
21/11/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, you can talk to your peers after the session end and once you get one do share with me.
21/11/23, 9:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Nicole- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
21/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 815 1615: I don't know how to start the conversations with the school heads
21/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 815 1615: May I have a clue please
21/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, of course Nicole.
21/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: We need to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
21/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
21/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
21/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!

22/11/23, 9:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, our goal should be to take a follow-up from him. So greet him politely and ask him what you shared about an amazing opportunity if they can let you know they are interested to know how this opportunity can help them in building a market value for themselves and outshine other schools.
22/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 815 1615: Okay noted
22/11/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Nicole- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

22/11/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
