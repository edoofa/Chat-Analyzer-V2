I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others. It's a thought that has been lingering in my mind ever since.

Now, I'm very curious about your talents, those unique gifts that undoubtedly define who you are. I'm eagerly anticipating hearing about them because I'm sure they're something special.

Afterward, let's also dive into the exciting world of projects on the *EWYL Line only*

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson, I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

01/11/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning, esteemed and proud Edoofians parents!

I trust your week is off to a fantastic start, and I'm absolutely delighted to be a part of this remarkable family that nurtures such brilliant students and parents who envision a bright future with us. Your trust, faith, and confidence in us fill me with immense pride.

Today, I'm thrilled to introduce you to our exceptional team, the _Department of Student Welfare_, who will be your child's guiding light once they arrive in India. Their unwavering commitment is to foster your child's growth and development throughout their journey.

01/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 753 6557: Goodday ma'am my thought on those pictures is that l can see and tell that 
1. There are mixed cultures or races that are united
2. Edoofa brought unity  harmony and happiness among those people
3. There is freedom and acceptance especially to the Africans being  accepted in a foreign land like lndia to do their studies freely
4. The students are very happy and excited, cheering up like that last picture(they can't believe that is it really us in lndia)
5. Happy to be Edoofians
6. Happy to link and be in the same class with lndians
7. Happy to stand next to lndian person as well as chat with them
My last thought it Edoofa is special is not selective loves everyone and cares for all people and have all people/races at heart.
KEEP UP THE GOOD FLAG EDOOFA STAFF  WELL DONE

18/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.

13/12/23, 12:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofians, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
