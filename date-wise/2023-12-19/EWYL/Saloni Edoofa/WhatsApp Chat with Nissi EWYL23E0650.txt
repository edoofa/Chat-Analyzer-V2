26/09/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to receive this, great to know about you!
26/09/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 402 4807: no l don't
26/09/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/09/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 402 4807: OK following
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

My name is SALONI. I would like to share that I will be your mentor for the Earn While You Learn Program, and together we will be undertaking this learning experience. Getting an opportunity to study abroad on a scholarship and to work on your skill set to be employment-ready, is something that any ambitious child would dream of. I hope that in a couple of years/ you’ll be able to agree with me that these are the best years of your life.
26/09/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I like to relate global and social eye-openers to our daily lives and how they can impact us. Furthermore, my interest is drawn toward painting and dancing. I enjoy interacting with young minds, and it brings me great satisfaction to see how diligent and focused young students are about their goals in life, whether personal or professional. I like kids who are curious to learn and are excited to add different skills to their knowledge each day. I believe that a student can achieve any goal through discipline and commitment. If you have the target set in your mind, no one can stop you from living your dreams and attaining greater heights. I wish you all the very best for this journey and I believe that together we can reach up the ladder and climb higher summits.
26/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 402 4807: I'm also excited and focused about this too Ms Saloni. Thank you

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

Praise Parwanyingira was in a Capital Market Quiz Competition. She was only the girl there among 3 boys form their school and she was science student not a commercial one. This competition was tough because her strength was in sciences. 
This competition made her realize that she can do anything in this world even if you don't any idea of what you are doing. 

This means that in this world one can be able to take risks even if he / she has no idea of the things. One has to dream big in this world and achieve the great heights.
