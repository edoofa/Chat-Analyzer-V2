05/10/23, 1:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Takunda, I believe that the admission team must have told you that parents should also be added to the group because it's important for parents to be aware of your progress and receive updates about sessions. 

So, I would really appreciate it if you add your parents to this group by sharing the link with them. This will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working together to support your learning. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay l am going to ensure that by the end of the day,there must have joined the group
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Takunda. Now, allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 
I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.

I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In case you face any problems while viewing the video, please let me know.
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

05/10/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.

Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay
05/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Yeah l have understood you very well, l would like to know about these two key objectives
05/10/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Takunda is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
05/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay that's great
05/10/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 850 2365: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so sorry Takunda. I wrote it by mistake.                                                                   
So Takunda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay it's clear enough , l am also hoping to work hard and ensure that am competent to maximize credits

Lastly but not least is to see my self in a position of being a successful person

06/10/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday*
06/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Alright
06/10/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
06/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay, I think Monday and Thursday will do for me
06/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 850 2365: I don't know if you are also ok with my suggestion
06/10/23, 1:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Takunda, but this will only come into action once we are finished learning the introduction about the EWYL PROGRAM.
06/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay
06/10/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

06/10/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
06/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Yeah l am ok with that
06/10/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
06/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay l will do so
06/10/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, so you can start reading the document now Takunda, since we have more than 30 minutes left.
06/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay sure
09/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Corporate alliance, Community building and African schools education reform mission
09/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 850 2365: From Corporate Alliances , we as students are supposed to carry out a series of steps in reconciling with with different companies or organisations.This process is undertaken online using the preferred LinkedIn webpage Or the mobile application and this website is effective in the way that it tell us the important information that is required for instance the number of employees and the right people.Under this project,it can be carried through connection from my relatives, senior and my parents which makes  the process easier to get the relevant information about the organisations and companies.I have also understood that there are five important aspects or activities to be done by a student in carrying out the project.The aspects are searching for companies, identification of the decision makers in such organisations, sharing the Edoofa message, arranging a video conference with Edoofa and signing the contract and the last activity is to record the progress of the project.In addition to the above, l have observed that for the project to be successful there are certain skills that we should equip to achieve our objectives as students. These are enduring skills which are those skills that remains constant with time like empathy, networking and so fourth. After all the above processes being implemented then a student can get his or her credits. I think that's all l can say .
09/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 850 2365: 2) Moving forward , under the second project l have understood that , students are now forming a group of people interacting by means of social , professional and education.The purpose of it is to notify or spread the information toother members or students with the concern o scholarship.The process is enabling us to e objectively trained on how to motivate and channelize other students to take a decision which will help them in their future.Under the project , students will be taking some form of advertising and l would describe the form as persuasive advertising as they will be convincing other students to take the way forward following their steps.There are many 3 activities to be done by students that is to fill application forms , secondly reaching out to the friends,relatives and etc sharing about Edoofa.lastly the incentives will be provided.
09/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Okay on the last project Edoofa is puting an emphasis in African communities to acquire knowledge and skills on various fields of education.We as students are given a role in reaching out local schools and speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa.l have liked the way that the program is aiming to increase earnings of student's credits and at the same time sharing world class technology and innovations happening in Indian schools to African countries.Under the project the students are to make list of Higher secondary Schools in their local areas and now Edoofa will identify decision makers in these schools. That's what l have understood
09/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 850 2365: Good Afternoon
09/10/23, 1:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon Takunda!_* I hope you had a wonderful weekend. 🌞✨

Could you kindly tell me when you'll be available to commence your sessions?
*Kindly mention the exact date*

I hope you're doing well. 
I was expecting to hear from you, but I think you must be finding it hard to get back to me. 
I wanted to bring to your attention that Cleopatra has missed a lot of sessions compared to other students.

Since exams seem to be over, I was wondering when are you looking forward to resuming our sessions.

15/12/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @263773157639 
I'm truly sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. Family and health take precedence over everything else, and it's completely understandable that you're prioritizing your son's well-being during this difficult time.
18/12/23, 10:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @263773157639 @263718502365 
I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
