Kurainashe Mumaniki Testimonial
Kurainashe is a boy from Zimbabwe whos currently studying in India through the EDOOFA Program. He said that it is an Edoofa initiative which helps students to earn credits through undertaking tasks with the EWYL Program run by Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to success (SEELs). He noted the online classes which include social media marketing, market research, blogging, article writing and also online projects. All these has helped him in improving his article writing skills and marketing skills. It has enlarged his knowledge of the business world. He said that the online tasks do not affect his learning since he just has to spare 1-2 hours a day for the tasks. The SEELs program has helped him in paying his fees as he will be earning monthly credits, so it helped him to understand that investment is better than a salary because with a salary you can purchase goodies but with an investment, you build a fortune.

01/08/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 915 3722: Okay following

07/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 915 3722: On the document the task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students  that enroll for the EDOOFA Program.bSo to make sure one looks for the right type of companies, one must consider the following:
1) Nature of company meaning it should be student centric, recreational or content centric platform
2)Scale of company meaning it should not be too big or too small ranging from 50 to 200
3) Financial Stability....it should be financially sound
4) Background of founder meaning the companies with the founder having a strong background are the most suitable ones
Platforms which can be used when looking for potential companies include Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase and Social Media Pages like Facebook, Instagram among others
The following steps can be used:
1) Searching start-ups and get links for the various Media platforms
2) Studying a little more about the company and its functioning through use of google to fund its area of expertise and past collaborations 
3) Studying the website of the company
4) Checking various social media pages of the company
5) Understand and study the background of the founder and other care members
6) Reaching out to companies by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request

10/08/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.

10/08/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

11/09/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
11/09/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
11/09/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day.

19/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 915 3722: okay thank you
19/09/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 915 3722: To effectively plan for an examination l have these tips and strategies that l think would help someone preparing for an examination. To effectively plan for an exam, l would advise someone to map out a study plan which can be 2 or three weeks before an examination. This will allow someone to avoid cramming and also help in alleviating stress. One has to make a revision schedule that is realistic and that suits him or her. The person has to personalize his or her notes in a way that is understandable. one of the best way to do so is to look at the past exam papers so that you familialize yourself with exam questions. After reading one also need to sit down and relax so as to freshen up the mind. Lastly, reward yourself to keep going.
19/09/23, 10:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, In order to avoid confusion. Let us communicate our session on one platform, i.e. EWYL LINE.
