04/08/23, 1:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon
Okay, Don't worry
04/08/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Good afternoon ma'am
04/08/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done Tatenda on sharing the forms🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
04/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Ok ma'am
04/08/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Did you go through this audio?
04/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Yes I did
04/08/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
04/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 910 8435: I have to create a WhatsApp group then I have to identify students who can be part of the group the aim will be to reach out to a large number of students and provided them with the necessary information about the Edoofa program
04/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 910 8435: And I also have to add you in the group
04/08/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Tatenda, I am impressed with your understanding.
04/08/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  

Here is the message -
04/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Ok ma'am
04/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Noted
04/08/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/08/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon*_☺️
I hope you are all doing well. *For the second week in a row, I had the incredible opportunity to welcome students at the airport,* and it was truly an overwhelming and heartwarming experience. _Let me share the glimpse with you as well and make it a memorable and enriching journey for all of us!_
Also, *I would like to tell you that we will definitely have our session tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm.*
07/08/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/08/23, 2:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Congratulations on submitting 8 forms Tatenda. Your proactive approach has truly brightened my day, and I am very proud of your outstanding efforts. Well done, Tatenda🌟

However, I would like to draw your attention to a few important matters. Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India. 

By following this approach, you can ensure that not a single form goes to waste. Rest assured, as soon as the 2025 admissions open, I will promptly inform you, enabling you to submit all the 2025 forms in a consolidated manner.

09/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 910 8435: I do not really know
09/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 910 8435: But I'll confirm
09/08/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Tatenda
09/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 910 8435: ma'am I have something to say ,on the last project  ,I will only be able to meet up with the principals and headmasters of schools including mine  when schools open on the 3rd of September right now we are on holiday so I can't reach them now
09/08/23, 1:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, In that case, I would suggest you listen to the project and understand. Once the schools will be open, You can execute that.

09/08/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Many thanks ma'am
09/08/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
09/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Yes I do agree
09/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Yes ma'am,its a great opportunity for my schoolmates to have this opportunity to be connected with Edoofa
09/08/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
09/08/23, 2:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
09/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Thank you for the advice.l will try my best to get my headmistress's  phone number
09/08/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
09/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Yes im ready
09/08/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I apologize for the delay. An unforeseen meeting with a high-priority requirement arose, necessitating my immediate attention. Now, let us connect tomorrow and continue from where we have left.

17/08/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
17/08/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.

So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

21/08/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Congratulations on submitting 2 forms Tatenda. Your proactive approach has truly brightened my morning, and I am very proud of your outstanding efforts. Well done, Tatenda🌟

However, I would like to draw your attention to a few important matters. Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India. 

By following this approach, you can ensure that not a single form goes to waste. Rest assured, as soon as the 2025 admissions open, I will promptly inform you, enabling you to submit all the 2025 forms in a consolidated manner.

So the actual forms that you have submitted right now is 1, the remaining 1 form is of 2025.
21/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 910 8435: Noted ma'am I will do that

29/08/23, 2:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for today. Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 10:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
