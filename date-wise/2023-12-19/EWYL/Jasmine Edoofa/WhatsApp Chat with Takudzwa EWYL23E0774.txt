Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
23/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 739 6259: That's wonderful madam.
23/10/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now we have completed our Project 1 Takudzwa. 
It was lovely talking to you.
23/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 739 6259: Pleasure is all mine madam, thank you so much for your help, may God bless you.
23/10/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: God Bless you too Takudzwa
25/10/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 739 6259: Okay, I have a question about whatsApp community groups
25/10/23, 12:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 10:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 739 6259: The most effective way which I can use to execute the community building project is to create a whatsApp group. After creating a whatsApp group, I have to identify the right students who can be part of the group. The main goal is to reach out to large number of students and provide them with the necessary information about Edoofa before the counseling session, ensuring their are prepared and have a smoothing counseling experience. To find the right, I can start by getting in touch with my school mates, who are currently in form six and those who pass their form six. I can do that by getting in their unofficial whatsApp group and sending them a message ( those who are looking for the opportunity to abroad education, can join my group).  Once the students join the group, I will start sharing the information about Edoofa program. I will also add you to the group for monitoring my progress and for addressing students queries.
25/10/23, 11:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Takudzwa, I am impressed with your understanding.
25/10/23, 11:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
25/10/23, 11:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
25/10/23, 11:55 am - +263 77 739 6259: That is great news indeed.
25/10/23, 12:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Let me share the picture with you.

28/10/23, 6:42 am - +263 77 739 6259: On Monday, in the afternoon, so we can have the session in the morning.
28/10/23, 6:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I appreciate your dedication as well. Since we couldn't have our session yesterday, I'd like to make up for it today by starting a bit earlier. Can you please let me know if you're available for our session now?
28/10/23, 6:46 am - +263 77 739 6259: Thank you, we can start
28/10/23, 6:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent. Last time we were discussing Project 3. Do you remember?
28/10/23, 6:50 am - +263 77 739 6259: Yes
28/10/23, 6:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
28/10/23, 6:53 am - +263 77 739 6259: Noted Madam.
28/10/23, 6:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
28/10/23, 6:54 am - +263 77 739 6259: Yes, I am ready
28/10/23, 6:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
28/10/23, 6:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

28/10/23, 7:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/10/23, 7:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/10/23, 7:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Tuesday i.e 14 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am*
09/11/23, 10:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨

Ensure you are on time so we can utilize each minute of the session wisely. ☺️
14/11/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I'm delighted to see that you've finished your activity, Takudzwa. Could you share if you had the opportunity to learn about Diwali?
14/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 739 6259: Diwali represents a lot of things, but the main themes are the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair. It's a time to celebrate the values of love, forgiveness, compassion, and humanity. It's also a time to give thanks for the harvest and the bounty of nature. For many, it's a time to reflect on the past year and look forward to the new year with hope and optimism.
14/11/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so happy to see that you know so much. This not only fosters cultural awareness but also promotes a sense of unity and shared humanity.
