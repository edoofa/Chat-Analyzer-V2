16/03/23, 8:27 am - You were added
29/08/23, 9:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
That is great, I would like to schedule a session with you on Monday i.e. *04-09-2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
29/08/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Afternoon this is when schools are opening what about Saturday 2 September
31/08/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Are you saying that you will be available for the sessions from September 2?
01/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 480 8904: Yes but l will be traveling back to school on Sunday
01/09/23, 3:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to send a mail to me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  _  from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Jasmine as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - ewyl@edoofa.com, and jasmine.edoofa@gmail.com.

 Once you are done, kindly let me know so that I can confirm.
01/09/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Ok
15/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Option 1Mondays, Tuesday and Wednesdays 1:30pm to 2:30pm is fine with me
18/09/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Cleopatra will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
18/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Noted
18/09/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Cleopatra can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
18/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes following
18/09/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of Earn While You Learn Program
18/09/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know that if Cleopatra is available? If yes then, 
1. Either you are put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one do you choose?
18/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 480 8904: She's not available for now. If possible l can continue with the program till she's through with her exams
18/09/23, 4:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: If you choose to continue, you are more than welcome. I would be explaining the projects in detail and guide on the execution. Will that be okay?
18/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Yes
18/09/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

19/09/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

19/09/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
19/09/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This is a ritual that I would really appreciate if you tell Cleopatra
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 480 8904: For sure am a proud edoofian
19/09/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
19/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 480 8904: I am a proud edoofian
19/09/23, 2:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now you can text on the Line and I will get back to you there in a while.
19/09/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. Have a wonderful day ahead!
19/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 480 8904: Same to you. Thank you
20/09/23, 8:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Morning my dear student*_

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement. So, *_I won't be available on Monday_*

Today, I'd like to share some insights about *Dussehra, a festival observed in India on the 24th of October* Dussehra marks the triumph of Lord Rama, an embodiment of the deity Vishnu, over the demon king Ravana. As per the epic Ramayana, Ravana had kidnapped Lord Rama's wife, Sita. This festival signifies the victory of righteousness (Rama) over malevolence (Ravana). Allow me to describe how I personally celebrated Dussehra.

Could you kindly tell me when you'll be available to commence your sessions?
14/12/23, 3:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263715765954 
I hope you're doing well. 
I was expecting to hear from you, but I think you must be finding it hard to get back to me. 
I wanted to bring to your attention that Cleopatra has missed a lot of sessions compared to other students.

Since exams seem to be over, I was wondering when are you looking forward to resuming our sessions.
18/12/23, 10:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @263715765954 
I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can. <This message was edited>
