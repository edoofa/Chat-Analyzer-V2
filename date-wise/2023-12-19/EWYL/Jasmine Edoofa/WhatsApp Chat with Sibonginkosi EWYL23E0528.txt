29/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 804 2552: EWYL program is a program that enables a student to acquire more skills and being improved in skills . A student performs projects and this enables them to acquire higher scholarship credits
29/08/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education. Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses. 

Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold.
29/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 804 2552: It's a pleasure
29/08/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It would be best if you allocate today's time to go through the attached document along with your family.

29/08/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 804 2552: Thank you so much
29/08/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 804 2552: I wish you a lovely Rakhi and enjoy your day

15/09/23, 8:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you Sibonginkosi
15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 804 2552: I would love that and my parents will be willing to help and it is an honour to have you as my mentor thank you alot
15/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 804 2552: Thank you alot
15/09/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So please let me know the suitable time.
15/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 804 2552: 1.30 to 2.30pm
18/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes I'm ready
19/09/23, 11:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 804 2552: Yes
19/09/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 804 2552: Morning
19/09/23, 12:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
19/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I'm good how is you
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
19/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Pleased to hear
19/09/23, 12:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, First of all, Allow me paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
19/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Thank you I'm very excited to have you on this journey
19/09/23, 12:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 12:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you Sibonginkosi
19/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 804 2552: You are welcome
19/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 804 2552: It's a pleasure knowing you
19/09/23, 1:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 804 2552: No I don't
19/09/23, 1:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Diana is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
19/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I understand
19/09/23, 1:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
19/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I understand ma'am
19/09/23, 1:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
19/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Good to know you Ms Sanjana and it is an honour
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Good to have Ms Davi
19/09/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Sibonginkosi to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days. <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Okay I understand
19/09/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/09/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Thank you
19/09/23, 1:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

How does that sound, Sibonginkosi?
19/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 804 2552: It sounds great and exciting
19/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 804 2552: I have through the newsletter
19/09/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great
19/09/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
19/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes it is okay
19/09/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I now is it clear?
19/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes it is clear
19/09/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes we are
19/09/23, 1:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Sibonginkosi is available? If no then, 
1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one you choose?
19/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 804 2552: Yes she's available and going for option 2
19/09/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey

19/09/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, definitely
19/09/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
