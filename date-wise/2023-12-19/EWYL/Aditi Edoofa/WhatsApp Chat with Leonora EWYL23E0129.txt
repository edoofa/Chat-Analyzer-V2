16/09/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Leonora!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 272 9911: Greetings how are you?

21/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.

21/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Leonara will learn a lot from this journey to success.
I can see that Leonara is very lucky to have such supportive parents like you.
21/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Okay thank you
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 272 9911: No l dont understand  you can highlight

22/09/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
22/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Greetings how are you
22/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 272 9911: We can begin
22/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks.
22/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *NAME* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
22/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Okay noted
22/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Well explained
22/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
22/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 272 9911: So amazing. I did finish reading the screenshot
22/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I would like Leonora to earn lots of credits like this.
22/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes yes  l really apreaciate that .lts so great
22/09/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Leonara* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Greetings . Ms Sanjana. How are you?
22/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Greetings . Ms Davi how are you doing
22/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 272 9911: So interesting but just a reminder to you that . Leonora is at school she does not have her mobile phone there. She is at a boarding school
22/09/23, 3:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Both of them are well and currently they won't be able to connect as they are busy in an important meeting.
22/09/23, 3:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I know, it's just so that you may convey this to her later.
22/09/23, 3:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺

25/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well
Thanks for asking.
25/09/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Leonara forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

26/09/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
26/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Leonara’s EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure she is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
26/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Thats great
26/09/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that she will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
26/09/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Okay noted
28/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that she has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
28/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
28/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help her to fund her higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
28/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 272 9911: Yes yes we are on the same page
