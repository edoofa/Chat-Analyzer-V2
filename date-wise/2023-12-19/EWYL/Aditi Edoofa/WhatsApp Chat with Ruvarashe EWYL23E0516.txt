I am doing well thank you
25/08/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

Please excuse me for not being able to take your session today as we were traveling and I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. The icing on the cake? We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Ruvarashe!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 314 6204: Option 1 is okay
16/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 314 6204: From 8:30
17/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 314 6204: This message was deleted
19/09/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 986 2562: Ms Aditi how are you.May I know if we are still connected or maybe you have rescheduled the sessions please.
19/09/23, 12:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

I apologize for not being able to take your session due to a prior commitment to address a personal matter.
Thank you for understanding.
19/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am very well thank you.It's fine and thanks for letting me know.
19/09/23, 1:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We will resume our sessions tomorrow and I can for you schedule them for Wednesday Thursday and Friday!
19/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you.Is it okay with you to reschedule the time to 2pm _ 3pm?
19/09/23, 1:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, sure we can do that!
19/09/23, 1:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I hope you would be there today at 2:00 Pm for the session.
19/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes I will be available
19/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
19/09/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, are you ready for today's session?
19/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am ready now
19/09/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
19/09/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Sure.I am not aware of the objectives.
19/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I have learnt that EWYL benefits the student financially as well as making it possible for the student to be employable.I hope these are the objectives?
19/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
19/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
19/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you we'll explained.
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 986 2562: well explained
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Waal wonderful.
19/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
19/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We hope to see Ruvarashe earning more credits and writing such email's after that.
19/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
19/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Pleased to know her.
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Noted thank you.
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay I understand the schedule and am eager to learn.
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am done with this one.It is an eye opener I tell you.The words are inspirational and food for thought.Thank you.
19/09/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
19/09/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
19/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you and am looking forward to connecting with you too tomorrow.
20/09/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I hope you are doing really well.

 So, are you ready to start our session?
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Am well Ms Aditi.Yes am ready
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Ruvarashe's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure Ruvarashe is given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically! <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Waaal! Am pleased to know this.
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Ruvarashe will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Okay.I will get back to you after going through the document.
20/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that would be appreciated.
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you.
21/09/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Good afternoon.Yes am ready.
21/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So @263779862562 may I know if you have gone through the document?
21/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes I went through it.
21/09/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So can you please share your brief understanding so that I can make sure that we are on the same page.
21/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I have read and understood that a student is expected to do some tasks so as to earn some some scholarship credits.I noted that it requires a lot of hard work and maximum commitment to do the projects.This is evidenced by the level of tasks to be completed.
21/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 986 2562: I have also understood that as an Edoofian, one has to inspire others to become Edoofians as well.
21/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is correct!
21/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Ruvarashe can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss the EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share the challenges and the things one is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make the mentor trust the student fully
I hope we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Yes we are on the same page.
21/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Ruvarashe is back, she is supposed to note a few things.

Either you can make the decision on her behalf, or she can be active for a few minutes in the session tomorrow and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once she is back from school.

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
10/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 986 2562: Thank you and I wish the same for you.
