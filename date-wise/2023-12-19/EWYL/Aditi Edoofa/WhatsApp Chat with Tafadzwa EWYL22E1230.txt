14/08/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 401 9456: Greetings, okay thank you
16/08/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings, champion! I am delighted to present you with the grant, and I want to express that your dedication and effort have yielded remarkable results. Your hard work has truly been rewarded, and I am thrilled to acknowledge your achievement in winning the 21-day grant challenge.
16/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 401 9456: Greetings. Thank you
16/08/23, 3:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 401 9456: yes I'm ready
16/08/23, 3:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 401 9456: that's great  the Grant Challenge is really awesome ,I have understood
16/08/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 401 9456: yes I'm now aware, thank you
16/08/23, 3:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 401 9456: thank you ,I'm glad I managed to be among the numerous students who were considered.
16/08/23, 4:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 401 9456: thank you ,I will do my best to aim higher
16/08/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our discussions. <This message was edited>

Review Email Settings: Double-check your email settings to make sure they are correctly configured. Ensure that you are using the right SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server and port settings.

Check for Outgoing Mail Restrictions: Some email providers or networks might have restrictions on sending large volumes of emails. Check if there are any limitations that could be causing emails to queue up.

Clear Queued Emails: Depending on the email client or software you're using, there might be an option to manually clear queued emails. Look for this option in the settings.

Re-send Queued Emails: If the issue was temporary, you might be able to manually re-send the queued emails. Check if your email client has a "Retry" or "Resend" option for queued emails.

Contact Email Provider: If you're using an email service provided by a company, reach out to their customer support for assistance. They might be able to provide specific guidance for your situation.

Check for Software Updates: Ensure that your email client or software is up to date. Sometimes, software updates can resolve known issues that cause emails to queue up.

I trust you are in good spirits.

I trust this message finds you thriving. As we continue our academic journey, I encourage you to consider an opportunity that holds the potential to become a lucrative income source in the coming 3-4 years.

I firmly believe that among your assignments and projects, there lie gems with the power to generate income. Whether it's a distinctive skill, a project close to your heart, or an inventive concept, the time is ripe for us to embark on this exploration together. Your commitment and creativity may pave the way for a prosperous financial future.

The task for the week- You have to create a 2-3 min video about your journey in Edoofa.

And in order to help you out, I'm providing some guidelines to simplify the process. You can discuss these key points in your video to ensure it is informative and adds value.

a) Your journey so far with the program
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourself and struggling with the process. (you may ask for DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system. <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

23/11/23, 3:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 401 9456: yes I do remember
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 401 9456: I think 
1.To say I am a proud Edoofian everyday at  9 am
2.Submission of given assignments
3.To submit projects (community building)
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 401 9456: okay great
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.

25/11/23, 5:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also here is the Saturday Activity of the week,

As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
27/11/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 401 9456: 1)Fill the form I will share with and the Admission team will reach out to you and make sure to follow all the instructions.

2)It seemed more reliable than other sources 

3)Edoofa helps you to find a university in India ,it shares your application with various universities  and you will receive offer letters ,from the offer letters you will choose the university which you want(Edoofa helps you to prepare the application form) .It also has an Earn While You Learn program ,where you get to earn scholarship credits which reduces your fees by doing various projects which is great .

4)There is high quality of education (it's not only the theory you learn as there is availability of equipments to do a lot of practicals)
27/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 401 9456: The spirit of competition refers to the attitude or temperament that seeks challenges and competition. It is an intrinsic value that drives people to win, succeed, and be the best they can be .Competitive spirit can help people focus on their goals and improve  themselves. It is important to balance this spirit with teamwork and respect to avoid toxicity. 
I used this spirit in my academic accomplishment that was for my O'level.I used to have this spirit of competition and I would compete with my two friends and it helped me to succeed but like I stated it has to be  accompanied with teamwork and respect and we followed that as to not break our friendship and it lead us to achieve our goals.
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You can refer to this document's *Training Resources* for the correct answers.

2. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that and it is the primary goal that I have for you. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
3. I sincerely think we both are a great team and I want to know the key areas that you have identified for yourself after reflecting on your performance until now, where you need more assistance from my end?

Activity Instructions:

Set Up Columns: Establish three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.
Calculate Average Time: Utilize Excel functions to find the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect: Allocate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll enhance these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you face any challenges. Let's delve into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

18/12/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *_Your main character era starts now!_*

I am delighted to share that one of my students *Shantel Maroza* has successfully surpassed her grant amount of *$200*, and I couldn't be more proud. She has earned *$240* credits in two months. Upon asking her how she could surpass the amount in just a few months, she shared a few tips and tricks with me, and I thought I should share these with you!

✔️She asked her parents to connect with her student's parents to talk about the Edoofa scholarship program.
✔️She highlighted the various opportunities like internships, webinars, and exposure to her students.
✔️She also asked her juniors from the school to add her to the group.

Tell me, what are the steps you are taking to surpass your limited grant amount?
