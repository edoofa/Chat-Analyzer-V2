10/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 156 0883: I'm sorry for today mem. My internet was very slow lately so I couldn't attend the session
10/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Simbarashe, I have been noticing your irregularity for a long time now, may I know if there is any concern?
10/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 156 0883: I had been writing end of term examinations mem so most of the times the time tables tend to crash. By the way,I finish school at 2.00pm so I don't know if it is possible to shift the time of the session and pit it at anytime after 2.00pm
10/08/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
10/08/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 156 0883: Thank you so much mem. Let me do that

26/10/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 959 1860: I was talking to Mr Shivjeet the admission officer about the process...... he explained to me that if a student has decided not to carry on with their academic journey after the A level results are out, they will have to take the ewyl projects where he'll be rewarded in cash until the money has been all payed back. So my question was ( Which are the examples of the projects that can be taken to allow the student to reach the amount of about $800, and how long can that take
02/11/23, 11:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Simbarashe!
Hope you are well.
06/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!
Hope you are well.

Please excuse me for the delay in reply due to some technical glitch
Simbarashe, I believe what he intended to convey is that as you embark on your EWYL journey with Edoofa, you can engage in these projects to stay connected with Edoofa. Your participation in these projects is intended to support your higher education in India, and you won't receive cash rewards but rather virtual scholarship credits that will directly cover your fees.
09/11/23, 1:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
