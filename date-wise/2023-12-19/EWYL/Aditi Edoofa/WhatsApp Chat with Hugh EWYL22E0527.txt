Hope you are well.

Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.
02/11/23, 4:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.

How are you doing?

As it is almost the end of the year let's go down the memory lane upon the amazing *Africa visit by Edoofa's visionary CEOs, Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen!*💫

On this trip, we gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape the future of Edoofa and further enhance the opportunities offered to our students.🚀

Thank you for being a part of the Edoofa family. We can't wait to share more about this unforgettable African expedition!💐
