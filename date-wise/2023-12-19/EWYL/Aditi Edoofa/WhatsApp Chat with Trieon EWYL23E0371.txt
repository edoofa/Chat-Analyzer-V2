08/08/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Trieon
Hope that you are doing well.

Let's begin with our today's discussions🚀
08/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 296 9662: Good morning
08/08/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Trieon, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
08/08/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 296 9662: To be a specialist in IT and EWYL help me earn through activities that I do
08/08/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, that is good.
08/08/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/08/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in your assigned time slot.
So we will start tomorrow with a bang and make this journey super amazing.
10/08/23, 8:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!🌞
How are you today?

Let's begin with our session
10/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 296 9662: Morning how are you
10/08/23, 8:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well,
Thanks.
10/08/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know why you are late for your session, Trieon?
10/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 296 9662: It could be network challenges
10/08/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Trieon please make sure that you have a good connection at least during our sessions as these sessions are very crucial for your EWYL journey.
10/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks
10/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
10/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
10/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 296 9662: Ok. Thank you
10/08/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
10/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 296 9662: True
10/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
10/08/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in your allotted time slot.

14/08/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 296 9662: True
14/08/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Trieon?

c) Work towards attainment of my goals
3. Mr Angad Singh interacts with us well and keeps well informed and give us good advice

14/08/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

Greetings of the day,

Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
04/09/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Once done, please let me know.
16/09/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Trieon!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Option B isn't possible because Trieon is currently at a boarding school where they are not allowed to use fones. He left his phone at home
16/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 296 9662: We can use option 1
19/09/23, 1:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
19/09/23, 1:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I apologize for not being able to reply due to a prior commitment to address a personal matter.
Thank you for understanding.
19/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 296 9662: How are you

I hope you are doing really well.

 So, are you ready to start our session?
20/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
20/09/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 296 9662: How are you. I was out of  town where nerwork was bad
21/09/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!

 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
26/09/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Tuesday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
26/09/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Our daily exploration comes to a close for today
Please be there in the sessions on time.
I hope you understand my point.
26/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 296 9662: How are you
26/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 296 9662: How is India

27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello!
I hope you are doing well

So, are you ready to start our session
27/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Students earn credits
Which help them reduce university fees
27/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *NAME* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
27/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
27/09/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Our daily exploration comes to a close for today

Thank you for being a part of this daily session. 
Rest well, and let's reconvene tomorrow with fresh perspectives and renewed enthusiasm.
27/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks
28/09/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon.
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
28/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Am fine and you
28/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming our discussion let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks
28/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Trieon* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
28/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Like l said initially Trieon is at a boarding high school from 4 September to 1 December 2023 where the use of cellphones is not allowed. As agreed with Ms Aditi, l was  doing it on his behalf
28/09/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I know this structure will be applied when he comes back!
28/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Ok
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once he forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

03/10/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Trieon*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Trieon* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
03/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 296 9662: OK noted
03/10/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Trieon* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in the allotted time slot.

04/10/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
05/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 296 9662: Yes
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
05/10/23, 3:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263772969662 I would request you to be there in the sessions for Trieon as these are very important for his EWYL Journey. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 296 9662: How are you

Thanks for asking.
09/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Trieon* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Trieon* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
09/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks
09/10/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. 
Either you can make the decision on behalf of *Trieon*, or he can be active for a few minutes in the session and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once he is back from school.
09/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Trieon is at boarding school and is only available after 1 December. They are not allowed to use cellphones at school
09/10/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So in this case you may take a decision on his behalf.
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively as I trust you recognize how valuable the EWYL session is.
09/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Ok
09/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 296 9662: OK but sometimes l will be in meetings or busy at work. I value EWYL and I will participate fully
09/10/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that would be appreciated.
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
10/10/23, 3:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm quite let down because you didn't show up for your scheduled session today without giving me any prior notice. I hope you understand how crucial these sessions are for Trieon.
