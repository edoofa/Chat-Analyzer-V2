10/08/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Blessed, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
10/08/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 677 2874: Indeed ma'am, the community building is definitely my favorite too.

10/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
10/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 677 2874: So in the *Community Building* project the main goal is to grow our own ecosystem as Edoofians. 
So I am required to reach out to fellow colleagues and help them join the community by use of networking skills and use of social media. This will promote social interaction.
10/08/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing Blessed!
10/08/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in your allotted time slot.

14/08/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 677 2874: I have a question regarding this form ma'am, after the potential eddofian has filled the offline form,  do i submit the form in this group or the student shares by themselves
14/08/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay so Blessed, the student will share the form with you and you have to share the form in the group.
14/08/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope it's clear now.
14/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 677 2874: Yes ma'am its clear
14/08/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
14/08/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
14/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 677 2874: I look forward to scoring many scholarship credits from this project
14/08/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: That is Superb!
14/08/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay ma'am
14/08/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*BLESSED/ADITI/14AUG23* <This message was edited>
14/08/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay, ma'am i will do so
14/08/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great.
14/08/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/08/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 677 2874: So ma'am,  for the participants in the group. Do i share the whatsapp group link to the the whatsapp groups i have asked to join for anyone to use the link to join for a mass pool or i have to identify the possibly right applicants
14/08/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can share the link of the group and later you can see for yourself on maintaining the quality/ right students in the group.
14/08/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay ma'am
14/08/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 
Also, I am pleased to inform you that tomorrow i.e. 15th August 2023 marks the 77th Independence day of India. Please note that in light of this special occasion, there will be no session held tomorrow, August 15th. We encourage you to take this time to reflect on the significance of this day in our nation's history and you can go through this article to know more about India’s Independence Journey.

15/08/23, 8:30 am - +263 71 677 2874: Good morning ma'am,  i am ready for today's session
17/08/23, 8:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well.

So, are you ready for today’s session?
17/08/23, 8:29 am - +263 71 677 2874: Good morning ma'am.
I am ready for today's session.
17/08/23, 8:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well.

So, are you ready for today’s session?
17/08/23, 8:31 am - +263 71 677 2874: Thank you for.sking, i am well. I am ready for the session
17/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 677 2874: Helloo ma'am
17/08/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great.
17/08/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
17/08/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
17/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 677 2874: As of now i dont have any school head's cell
Let me look for some.
17/08/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that would be great.
17/08/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
17/08/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
17/08/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 677 2874: I understand maa
17/08/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 677 2874: *ma'am
17/08/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: Our daily exploration comes to a close today.

21/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 677 2874: So, ma'am pertaining this. Do i share the resources after i get a response or as i wait for one.
21/08/23, 8:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, do share these after you get a response from the School Head.
21/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay ma'am. I will do so
21/08/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.
21/08/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: *School Details*:

1. School Name: 
2. School Province: 
3. Name of the contact person: 
4. Designation of the contact person:
5. Whatsapp Number:
6. Year of the establishment of the School: 
7. Pass% of A level (Last Academic year): 
8. No. of teachers in School:
9. The number of students in A level: 
10. Fees structure in A level (Per Term in USD): 
11. Date of Call:
12. Time of the scheduled meeting (CAT):



*Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name:
2. EWYL Group Name: 
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
21/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 677 2874: As of now ma'am, i haven't gotten a response. So i dont have time agreed for the meeting. Is it okay that I share the information once they have agreed
21/08/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you can do that.
21/08/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
21/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 677 2874: Sure thing ma'am, so if the fees is above $300 which is usually the least, it is okay
21/08/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, it works.
21/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 677 2874: Great

21/08/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!

22/08/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, it does terminates it and we will meet according to your new schedule.
22/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay ma'am

22/08/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
22/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 677 2874: Do i send this message once or everytime before we start a session
22/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 677 2874: Concerning this message, is there a particular time I have to send it or just in the period of 24hrs
22/08/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Only once and that is today after your session and everyday you have to send I am a Proud Edoofian on this EWYL Line.
22/08/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can surely do it in a period of 24 hours but sending in the morning would be better as it would align with my working hours.
22/08/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 677 2874: Thank you ma'am, its now clear
22/08/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great.
22/08/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay ma'am.
22/08/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
22/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 677 2874: No ma'am i don't know the stages. It would be appreciated if you could share.
22/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
22/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
22/08/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.

Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries <This message was edited>
22/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 677 2874: Thank you.
22/08/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
22/08/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 677 2874: Surely I will do so if i have any.
22/08/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great.
22/08/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
22/08/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: -There is no deadline for the project.
-There is no order in which you have to do the project.
-There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
-There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
22/08/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 677 2874: That's great. I will surely try to progress each day
22/08/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
22/08/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, this is it from my side for your sessions here in the group, now we will be connecting on the EWYL Line.
Make sure you follow all the rules and be regular and active in your sessions to have a fruitful EWYL Journey and earn credits to self finance your higher education.
22/08/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Have a good day!
22/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 677 2874: Thank you.

I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family and friends!*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 8:30, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.

04/12/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great, can you share what you have retained till now from the EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
04/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 677 2874: From our previous sessions, I had been tasked to reach out to colleagues and enlighten them about edoofa as well as reaching out to schools to organize meetings
04/12/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
04/12/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing! <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
04/12/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 677 2874: We can proceed ma'am, for now I don't have any questions or areas that need to be highlighted
04/12/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
04/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 677 2874: Thank you for the kind words, am honored to have you ma'am as my mentor
04/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
04/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
04/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 677 2874: I will go with *MONDAY and THURSDAY*
04/12/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
04/12/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
04/12/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
04/12/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/12/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
04/12/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
04/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay ma'am I understand.
04/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:
▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
04/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 677 2874: Sorry ma'am I have a question, I don't understand the point where I have to share my lesson and activity responses
04/12/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so basically do you remember the program structure?
04/12/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: It mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
04/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 677 2874: Ohh okay, I get it now. Thank you ma'am.
04/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
04/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
04/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Blessed, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
04/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 71 677 2874: Okay ma'am, thank you.
18/12/23, 10:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning @263716772874 
Hope you are well.

It is evident that you have not complied with the *PROUD EDOOFIAN* ritual on the  EWYL line. Kindly perform it to kickstart your session. 
And make sure that you follow it everyday.
