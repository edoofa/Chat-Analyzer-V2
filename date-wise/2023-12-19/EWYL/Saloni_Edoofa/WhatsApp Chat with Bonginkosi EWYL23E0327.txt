23/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

12/09/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/09/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
13/09/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Happy Wednesday my lovely student!_

May I know the challenges that Bonginkosi is facing on attending the regular sessions with me?
15/09/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 365 8057: Good morning, we are well thank you, was asking him too, says it's due to extra lessons, it's so unfortunate he is not proactive to inform you in advance
15/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 611 9130: good afternoon
I'm good 
how are you
15/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 611 9130: yess we may begin
15/09/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
15/09/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
15/09/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

Till then, have a great weekend🌺
15/09/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 611 9130: noted
16/09/23, 10:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 365 8057: Good noted, with thanks, even during the week it's still fine, teachers just plan extra lessons on short notice making it difficult at times to notify you well in advance about it
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you see the video, do let me know how you find it and of course, pick out your best section from the newsletter. Excited to hear that out!
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session⚡
27/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 365 8057: Good day, Bonginkosi is writing Technical graphics paper 3
27/09/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, as parent I would appreciate that we continue with the session.
27/09/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you saw the video and the newsletter that were shared in the group last week?
27/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 365 8057: In that case I kindly ask that we do it tomorrow, am compiling continuous assessment marks for my candidates due date is tomorrow, they are being sent to our national examination board, Zimsec
27/09/23, 12:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay no worries I understand that.
27/09/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 365 8057: You're welcome, thank you
27/09/23, 12:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: But may I know if you can spare just 20 minutes of time and resume your compilation work after these 20 minutes?
27/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 365 8057: 20 mins is fine
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great, thank you for cooperating!
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Bonginkosi's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
27/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 365 8057: It sound fantastic
27/09/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing!
Now for the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Bonginkosi will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
27/09/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 365 8057: Received will read
27/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Bonginkosi can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 365 8057: Yes indeed
27/09/23, 1:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now our scheduled session will be happening on *Saturday* from *08:00-09:30 AM*⏳ this week.
27/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 365 8057: It's fine
30/09/23, 8:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/09/23, 8:05 am - +263 77 365 8057: Good morning we may begin, it's Bonginkosi's father Bonginkosi has a Geography seminar
30/09/23, 8:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, sure, I am super glad to have you sir.
30/09/23, 8:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
30/09/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
30/09/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
30/09/23, 8:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
30/09/23, 8:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
30/09/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 365 8057: Noted, we want Bonginkosi to be the one taking sessions, we will chip in when it's mandatory to do so
30/09/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before she takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
30/09/23, 8:36 am - +263 77 365 8057: Noted, Bonginkosi is a boy
30/09/23, 8:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please sorry for the misunderstanding, thanks for clarifying.
30/09/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 365 8057: No worries
30/09/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would request that once you have done this, just let me know.
30/09/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay, got occupied in an urgent call.
30/09/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would request that I take 15 minutes of you of possible and take forward the session.
30/09/23, 9:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you done this?
30/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 365 8057: Hello sorry got extra lessons up to 3pm will be free thereafter

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart.
