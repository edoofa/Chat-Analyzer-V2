I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
19/09/23, 12:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM*⏳ this week.

I will be conducting the session *today, 20 September 2023* from *02:30 to 03:30 PM*⏳ as planned. _It's essential that either the child or a parent is present during the session._
