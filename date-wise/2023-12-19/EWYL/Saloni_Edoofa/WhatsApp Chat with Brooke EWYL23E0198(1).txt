14/09/23, 3:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Brooke, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to Galgotias in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
14/09/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: A handwritten letter can be something like this (this is just a sample for you, don't copy-paste anything)
The letter has to be completely based on your personal experience

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session👏🏼

I want to begin the session by asking if you have understood the $300 Training document well?
15/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 73037 16239: I understand it
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Brooke, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,

27/11/23, 2:35 pm - +91 73037 16239: 🙂
27/11/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +91 73037 16239: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually.
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +91 73037 16239: Yes
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 73037 16239: Yes l do remember
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Brooke, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 73037 16239: Yes
 I have to attend 75 percent of my classes  and  and these sessions as well
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is partially correct!
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 73037 16239: Ok noted ma'am
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 73037 16239: yes ma'am
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 73037 16239: Ok noted ma'am
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 73037 16239: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 73037 16239: I'm not really sure because there were times I was busy with school and had network problems mam
27/11/23, 2:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 73037 16239: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 73037 16239: I attended most of the webinars mam not one
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Attendance for the webinar is recorded based on the allocated time associated with the ID used for registration. We've established a specific time threshold; attendance is marked only if the student participates up to that designated time. This ensures accurate tracking and verification of attendance, promoting fairness and consistency in the process. If a student attends the webinar beyond this designated period, their attendance will be recorded.
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 73037 16239: Really mam ??
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - +91 73037 16239: wat does the green colour mean
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Nothing, just making the months on which you have been evaluated.
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes that is true!
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 73037 16239: Okay noted
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 73037 16239: That is bad then
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 73037 16239: Ok that is very say
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 73037 16239: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:11 pm - +91 73037 16239: Wow that's admirable
27/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 73037 16239: Okay noted , so how am l going to improve and redeem the grant
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 73037 16239: Okay noted l will do my best
27/11/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 73037 16239: Ok let's do it
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 73037 16239: I won't forget about that
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will continue our discussion tomorrow from 06:00 - 07:00 PM, please make sure you come on time for the session.
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 73037 16239: So  if l am late for the webinar there is no attendance? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: There will be but we have a set time and you have to attend the webinar till that time at least. 
Also, I would personally say that there will be no point and leaning if you join the webinar late.
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 73037 16239: And wat is the set time mam
27/11/23, 3:38 pm - +91 73037 16239: This October l did try to be  in the webinars as early as possible
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We can not share that but you have to attend most part of the webinar.
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 73037 16239: At this point I don't understand
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 73037 16239: I was in the webinars for most of the webinar mam
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Attendance for the webinar is recorded based on the allocated time associated with the ID used for registration. We've established a specific time threshold; attendance is marked only if the student participates up to that designated time.

27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 73037 16239: 😔
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is great Brooke but again, I would like to highlight the same that attendance for the webinar is recorded based on the allocated time associated with the ID used for registration. We've established a specific time threshold; attendance is marked only if the student participates up to that designated time. This ensures accurate tracking and verification of attendance, promoting fairness and consistency in the process.

27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 73037 16239: Mam u r still saying the same thing
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you must have attended the webinar and I am not denying that Brooke, but Mr. Anik would have marked your attendance if you would have attended beyond or equal to that standard time that we have set.
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 73037 16239: Hmm ok
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 73037 16239: Mam where l live the network is really bad
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 73037 16239: And there is no way I can fix that ma'am

28/11/23, 9:47 am - +91 97178 36966: Hello  mam l am not  talking about  phone network  I'm talk about  the  area  that  l live in not having  good network.

08/12/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
08/12/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 9 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 2:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening,

Kindly confirm your acknowledgment at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.
09/12/23, 2:39 pm - +91 73037 16239: Okay

09/12/23, 5:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share the updates on the same Brooke?

09/12/23, 5:10 pm - +91 73037 16239: 3.2k

5.no

09/12/23, 5:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
09/12/23, 5:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
09/12/23, 5:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
09/12/23, 5:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
09/12/23, 5:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I'm concluding our session for now. I'm pleased with the progress we've made, and your dedication is something I'm proud of. Always remember, I'm here to support you. Feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance. Looking forward to our next call session next week. Until then, have a wonderful day!
09/12/23, 5:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: These messages will help them understand that India is not expensive.
09/12/23, 6:03 pm - +91 73037 16239: noted  ma'am
09/12/23, 6:10 pm - +91 73037 16239: ok thank you

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝
