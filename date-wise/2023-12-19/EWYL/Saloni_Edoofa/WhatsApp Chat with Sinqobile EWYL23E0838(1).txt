01/11/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have understood from the document?
01/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Well the first project I don't understand it clearly . But it's says that I have to approach a company and introduce t Edoofa scholarship program  to the company and ask the company to work with Edoofa interms of hiring Edoofa students for the jobs after school . If the student manages to do that he or she will earn scholarship credits
01/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Project 2 it's a task for student to introduce other students to Edoofa scholarship program and give them a chance to study abroad.  I will have to  convince students to apply to the program tell them about the EWYL and it's benefits for the students .  And if I manage to get students to apply for the program then I will be rewarded with scholarship credits
01/11/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, I am so happy to hear about that🌟
01/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
01/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky ma'am
01/11/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky ma'am done
01/11/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you listen to the audio, do let me know.
01/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 547 2288: I have listened to it
01/11/23, 2:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share with me what you have understood from the audio?
01/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky
01/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 547 2288: What I understand is that the purpose of the project is to train me to understand the marketing business . And connect with companies and explain how Edoofa is helping me with employability opportunities. For that I have to create a LinkedIn account were I can identify such companies
01/11/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

07/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky
07/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 547 2288: According to my understanding the second project requires me to reach out to other African students who have completed their A level or doing their last year of A level and tell them about  Edoofa scholarship program. So they could get an opportunity to study abroad and fulfill their desires . Explain to them how Edoofa scholarship program operates and help them get link to apply for the scholarship program. At the end I earn points for managing to share with others about Edoofa and helping them to apply . So they can do careers of their choices
07/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Sinqobile, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
07/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

07/11/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
07/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky 😊
07/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Sinqobile/Saloni/7NOV2023*
07/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/11/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/11/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
07/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky I understand
07/11/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have understood it?
07/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Yes I have understood . I can create the group and share link with other students to join then I share to them my knowledge about Edoofa . And share the offline application so they can apply .
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, and I am excited to begin with our last project tomorrow!
07/11/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Afternoon ma'am
Yes we can begin
08/11/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
08/11/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky I understand
It's requires me to connect with schools here in Zimbabwe. Tell them about Edoofa scholarship program and ask the principal to connect with you guys so that  you can enlighten them more about Edoofa.
08/11/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

08/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky thus grt
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Sinqobile- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
08/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Then we are ready to move on to an amazing journey👏🏼
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your session will be from 12:00-01:30 PM on
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*MONDAY and THURSDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky I understand
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 547 2288: So can I do that now
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you have to do that now.
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Oky
09/11/23, 1:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hey Sinqobile!

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 547 2288: Good afternoon ma'am
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is a special one – it's an extension of the empowering lesson we explored on Wednesday: Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them.

As we discussed, the key lies in empowering ourselves to take control and navigate through challenges with resilience and determination. Now, it's time to put this wisdom into action!

For today's activity, I invite you to share an incident from your own life where you applied this learning. Think about a moment when you faced adversity and instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, you took charge with determination.

By sharing your experiences, you not only reinforce the valuable lessons learned but also inspire and motivate your peers. Your stories are a testament to the strength and resilience within our community.

Feel free to write a paragraph or two about your experience and share it in the group. Let's learn from each other's triumphs and continue to grow together.

Looking forward to hearing your empowering stories!

Best,
Team EWYL!
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the Saturday activity for this week, though I was supposed to share the same with you on the EWYL Line only. I noticed that you did not follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud edoofian' there, therefore, I took the initiative to share it here since I believe you are a bright student and have the capabilities. But I would like to inform you that I can not always turn my way, I hope you understand that. 
Please make sure you follow the ritual without fail and be present for your session on Monday from 12:00-01:30 PM.
18/11/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 547 2288: Good morning ma'am am very sorry for not showing up for my session yesterday . I was writing 2papers so I forgot to inform you that I will not be available. But am done with the exams . I will be available for all my sessions  .
18/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 547 2288: My name Sinqobile. I grew up in Makokoba . Makokoba is a ghetto suburb . Growing up I didn't face any challenges in life because I had both my parents with me . 

You know when growing up as a child you get to have friends within the community. Some friends are good some are bad . They influence you to do things that are not accepted in your family . When I grew up I had friends some of them are now into drugs . They dropped out of school. They tried to influence me to join them but I refused .  
 You know it's hard to resist peer pressure from friends because you will also wanting to fit in the cycle . So in order to avoid getting into drugs and dropping out of school . I had to cut ties with my friends from my community . I decided to stay at home and focus on my school work and future . 

Makokoba is a very influential suburb . It's has a lot of criminal activities go on . For one to be able to survive in such a community he or she has to be resilient and be focused on he or  she wants in life . And having strict parents who will guide and give you good values and morals helps a child to overcome peer pressure .
21/11/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Sinqobile,
How are you?
21/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 547 2288: Good morning ma'am
Am good thanks and you
21/11/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you, Sinqobile, for sharing your story. It's clear that you've faced challenges growing up in a community with its share of difficulties, but your determination and the support of your parents have been crucial in guiding you on a positive path.

Resisting peer pressure, especially when it involves negative influences like drugs, can be incredibly difficult. Your decision to prioritize your education and future over succumbing to those pressures is commendable. It's also evident that the values and guidance provided by your parents played a significant role in shaping your choices.
21/11/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: But I want to share that you need to share the response to the Wednesday lesson on Thursday before your session begins and of Saturday activity on Monday before your session begins on the EWYL Line only.
21/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 547 2288: Oky ma'am I understand
04/12/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Sinqobile!
