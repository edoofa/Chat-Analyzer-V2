Let's raincheck and I'll inform you a date that is doable
28/08/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay sure, I want that you clear your schedule for this time so that we can have regular sessions.
29/08/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings @263773396006 @263712258413 !
How are you?
29/08/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It's crucial that you provide the required information, or else, your name may unfortunately be included in the Academic Board of Edoofa's defaulters list. Your cooperation in this matter is highly valued and appreciated.
29/08/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Good day. Simba is yet to write his examinations and is unfortunately not available during the said time as he will be attending some private tutorials. I had indicated in email earlier if he could be excused until he finishes his examinations, which are crucial for him to gain entry to the Edoofa scholarship program.
29/08/23, 1:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share the exact date when he can be available for the EWYL Sessions?
29/08/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Let me get back to you when I have checked his examination timetable
29/08/23, 1:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I will wait for it. <This message was edited>
29/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Thank you
16/09/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 339 6006: I would not have minded doing it on his behalf but 0930hrs to 1100hrs is during working hours I will not be allowed to divert from my work
19/09/23, 9:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Simba and parents!
How are you?
19/09/23, 9:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that you and your parents may have commitments here at the school, but it's important to recognize that you've come a long way already. You've successfully completed the counseling process and paid your enrollment fees, showing your dedication to this journey. Just as we follow a fixed timetable for classes and office hours, we have a similar schedule for these essential sessions.
19/09/23, 9:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: I want to assure you that I value your time. On my end, I've streamlined the process to just a few days, and in some cases, it can even be completed in a single day. Your participation is crucial, and I kindly ask for your cooperation in acknowledging and attending these sessions. It's a small investment of time for the long-term benefit of your education and future success.
19/09/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 339 6006: Please advise what you need us to do on our part and we can can see how it can be worked out. With Simba in school most of the time and myself working Monday to Friday 8 to 5, it leaves very little time on my hands. Please advise
19/09/23, 12:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Simba and parents!
How are you?
19/09/23, 12:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can we have the session on Saturday?
19/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Please advise time
19/09/23, 12:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 08:00 to 09:30 AM
19/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 339 6006: How many Saturdays?
20/09/23, 12:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you're having a good day.

I sincerely apologize for not being able to conduct the session at the originally scheduled time due to unforeseen circumstances. Please rest _assured that there is no need to worry_. I will be conducting the session *today, 20 September 2023* from *02:30 to 03:30 PM*⏳ as planned. _It's essential that either the child or a parent is present during the session._

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session later today.
20/09/23, 12:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since this Saturday, the organization will remain closed. Therefore, I will soon make a plan on how I can accommodate and fastrack the sessions.
20/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Good day Ma'am, as explained earlier, I am not able to attend a session whilst at work. If you could schedule it at 1300hrs to 1400hrs maybe I can use my lunch hour for the session🤷🏽‍♀️
20/09/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 339 6006: Ma'am I think I advised you to schedule one session during my lunch time
27/09/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing? 

Let's begin with our sessions 💥
27/09/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 339 6006: Okay
27/09/23, 9:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
27/09/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 339 6006: Okay
27/09/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
27/09/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 339 6006: Sure
27/09/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 339 6006: Noted
27/09/23, 10:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/09/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 339 6006: No, you may advise me
27/09/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Simba is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
27/09/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
27/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 339 6006: Noted
27/09/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Simba's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Simba?
27/09/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 339 6006: Its a good start
27/09/23, 10:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, for the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Simba will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
27/09/23, 10:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 1:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 1:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now our scheduled session will be happening on *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM*⏳ next week.
27/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Please may you try and schedule it for 1300hrs to 1400hrs, my lunch time. Also you suggested Saturdays. I went offline just after you sent the document as I had to attend to some issues at work.
27/09/23, 1:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For Saturday, the sessions are held from 08:00-09:30 AM onwards. Will that be fine?
27/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Simba will attend yes
27/09/23, 1:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, then I will shift your session at that time.
27/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Thank you
30/09/23, 8:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/09/23, 8:12 am - +263 77 339 6006: Yes 
We may begin.
30/09/23, 8:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Simba can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
30/09/23, 8:19 am - +263 77 339 6006: Yes we are on the same page
30/09/23, 8:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome!
30/09/23, 8:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
30/09/23, 8:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
30/09/23, 8:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
30/09/23, 8:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
30/09/23, 8:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
30/09/23, 8:29 am - +263 77 339 6006: Simba will not be available for sessions. He does not have a phone at the moment
30/09/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before she takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
30/09/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 339 6006: I understand
30/09/23, 8:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would like to request if you have done it, just let me know.
30/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 339 6006: Alright
30/09/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I please know if you have done that?
30/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 339 6006: Yes I have.
30/09/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, let me check.
30/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 339 6006: I am a Proud Edoofian
30/09/23, 9:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please say in on the EWYL Line.

18/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 339 6006: It is important to start from humble beginnings going up. This helps one to appreciate the value of each step of their journey to success and not take anything or anyone for granted in their lives.

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.

May I know what happened to him?

18/12/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I'm sorry to hear that he has been struggling with asthma. I'm relieved to know that he is stable now. If there's anything I can do to offer support or if you have any specific concerns, please feel free to share. Wishing him continued stability and good health.
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 339 6006: Thank you Saloni, much appreciated. He is a known asthmatic but he just went through a series of attacks between November and early December. He had been on medication but the attacks were rather severe. He is much better now. Just monitoring to see how it will end
