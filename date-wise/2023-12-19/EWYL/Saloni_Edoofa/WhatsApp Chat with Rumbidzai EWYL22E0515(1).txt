I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂. My goal is to lead you toward achieving remarkable milestones and make this journey truly fulfilling for you. While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read the above-shared newsletter.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
18/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 312 3999: Thank you for the newsletter. It's really educative. I have learnt that for one to be successful in life you should put effort in everything you want to achieve. Even when things seem impossible or setbacks keep you back, keep on focusing. Always look at setbacks and failures as learning opportunities. I'm really inspired by the science students who managed to stand for their school in a Business Studies quiz and came in the second place.
18/10/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day to our proud edoofian and parents!
18/10/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!
07/11/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon, _my wonderful Edoofian and parents!_

I hope you're all doing fantastic! I am absolutely thrilled to share the incredible experience of our recent orientation journey at various partner universities. Our orientation event is not just a mere program; it's a grand welcome to an exciting academic adventure. At Edoofa, we ensure that our students are well-prepared for what lies ahead, and we open the doors to a world of exclusive opportunities for them. The response from our amazing students has been nothing short of overwhelming, and I am bursting with pride to be their mentor👏🏼
07/11/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This event was made possible through the partnership of the Earn While You Learn Team and the Department of Student Welfare, whom we discussed last week. Take a look at this remarkable journey, and imagine how you'd like your own orientation program to be. Just picture the excitement of meeting me, your mentor, in person!
*What would your dream orientation program look like?*
_Share your thoughts and let's make it an interactive and lively conversation! 😊_

_Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights_, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

16/12/23, 6:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening,

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.

16/12/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 312 3999: Hi Saloni. Thank you for your concern . Rumbidzai and Alouis are no longer able to carry on with the ewyl program at the moment for reason beyond their control as children
18/12/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon @263773123999 
How are you?
18/12/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you please share the reasoning with me so that I can assist you in the right direction?
