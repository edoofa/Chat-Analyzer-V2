I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your schedule is:

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 18/10/2023

  *Week 3*: Call on Saturday
📅 28/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00 - 06:45 PM
📅: 02/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*

13/10/23, 1:27 pm - +267 77 814 654: So on Nyasha's case it means she can't redeem the scholarship credits because they are little but can redeem the grant instead
13/10/23, 1:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Grant can only be availed if she actively participates in sessions and projects with me. In case of no participation, the grant might be revoked.
13/10/23, 1:34 pm - +267 77 814 654: Ma'am right now Nyasha's fone is refusing to connect to all Internets she is not unable to participate well because of that and myself the parent not having money right now for her to buy a new phone as I am having some challenges but hopefully things will settle for the good
13/10/23, 1:40 pm - +91 73034 51843: So if I uses that which is high what happens to that which is little
13/10/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It will still stay in your account, you can use them in the second year if they are greater than grant amount.
13/10/23, 1:46 pm - +91 73034 51843: Ma'am which account because I don't have any
13/10/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I mean we will keep a track of these virtual scholarship credits that you have earned.

My first duty is always to look after my students but simultaneously as a leader, I need to see that my team also gets the advantage of such opportunities. As a reason, I was not present at the airport, and similarly, I have been given the responsibility of another partner university. It never means that I don't love you Nyasha or don't care about you, it just that I have to keep a balance and we all what to respect what has been offered. You will absolutely love what is going to happen tomorrow dear, and I am sure you will video call me tomorrow?

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,

27/11/23, 2:33 pm - +91 73034 51843: Yes Maaam
27/11/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually.
27/11/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +91 73034 51843: Yes I do remember
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Nyasha, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 73034 51843: I think discipline
hard work
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, that are the attributes of a 'proud edoofian'.
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 73034 51843: Oky
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 73034 51843: Noted ma'am

Yes I have maintained my attendance in the school
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 73034 51843: So you mean to say I can only redeem either the grant or Scholarship credits after paying my fees how

I am confused
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 73034 51843: Noted

This is good
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This means you can use either your grant or scholarship credits, which ever are higher.
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 73034 51843: Oky maam
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 73034 51843: Yes ma'am I am aware
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 73034 51843: Yea i really understand
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 73034 51843: But ma'am I have attended the webniars with my housemates on the phones as mine does not connect
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: After all the webinar, did you share the understanding with me?
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 73034 51843: That one did not cross my mind but I am sure I have been joining with my collegues

27/11/23, 2:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before every webinar, our mentors, including Mr. Anik, always say to let them know if you're using a shared device and let me know your understanding through which I will be able to track your performance. A lot of students put their names in the chat during the webinar to let everyone know and share their understanding with me to cross verify.
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 73034 51843: I did not know maam
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is the thing Nyasha.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 73034 51843: Yes maam
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 73034 51843: So my grant will it still be there
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +267 77 814 654: I have a question ma'am so you have said Nyasha can't use her grant on her second semester can you clarify please
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If you work hard, you can get it back!
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 73034 51843: Oky ma'am
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Due to Nyasha's performance not lying as per the standard of the grant guidelines, therefore, she can not avail the grant as of now.
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 73034 51843: Oky thank you maam
27/11/23, 3:08 pm - +267 77 814 654: But I have also notify about the problem of her foni and she joined with her roommates foni
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - +267 77 814 654: I think you are not fair here ma'am because if your student has a problem it means you don't tolerate
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - +267 77 814 654: You used to say being an Edoofian your education will be affordable but I am not seeing the affordability part of it
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As mentioned we always inform in the webinar that they need to share their understanding with us in order to have their attendance marked irrespective if they have attended from their phone or someone else's.
Also, her attendance in the EWYL Program is fair and I was never unfair to her because despite knowing that her phone was damaged, I made an individual call with her to share the updates and even marked the attendance for that despite the fact that I was being unfair to other students by doing that.
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - +91 73034 51843: Oky ma'am
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I assure you that this can be achieved if Nyasha plans to work hard with me,
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 73034 51843: Thank you ma'am
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 73034 51843: Yes
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 73034 51843: The table is clear and it helps to boost enough effort and hardwork
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will continue our discussion tomorrow from 06:00 - 07:00 PM, please make sure you come on time for the session.
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 73034 51843: Oky ma'am
27/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 73034 51843: Thank you
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - +91 73034 51843: Maam I have checked my timetable and am finishing school at 1755 so am asking for time extension so that when I get home I will be able to connect with you
28/11/23, 8:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Nyasha!
How are you?
28/11/23, 8:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can say to you that our major discussion was already done for yesterday and we just have to discuss how you will be rolling through your performance and your plan of action to achieve our target. In case you will also be able to join the session by 06:15 PM, then it will be fine.
28/11/23, 8:44 am - +91 73034 51843: Am a proud Edoofian
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in our schedule. Since I have a family event tomorrow, I need to reschedule our *EWYL Group session* for *today from 07:00 PM to 07:45 PM*. I hope this adjustment is convenient for you.

28/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 73034 51843: Yes
28/11/23, 3:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - +91 73034 51843: Nited
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 73034 51843: Noted maam
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 73034 51843: I understand maam
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any doubts?
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - +91 73034 51843: No
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, how have you planned to work from now onwards?

09/12/23, 2:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

18/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: 🚀 *Exciting Update Alert: 17 Days In, 14 to Go!* 🚀

Guess what? We're halfway through the marathon, with only 14 day left to crush it in the grant game! 🏁✨

Let me spill some tea – one of our rockstar students flipped his eligibility from "not eligible" to "grant-ready" last month! How, you ask? By showing up to every call, putting in his 100% on projects, and making it happen. 🌟
18/12/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that exams are breathing down your neck, but fear not! Our meetings maybe once a week, but let's make every second count. 🕰️

*To keep the momentum rolling, I want you to set a target to submit at least one application for a $300 plan by Wednesday!* 🚀💸
Let's do this!
18/12/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: I have noted this, thank you!
18/12/23, 10:07 am - +91 73034 51843: Thank you
