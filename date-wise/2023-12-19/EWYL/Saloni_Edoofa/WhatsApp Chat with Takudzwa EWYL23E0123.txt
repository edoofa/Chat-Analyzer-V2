My apologies for not communicating
11/08/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That's alright, but make a habit to communicate me prior.
11/08/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Takudzwa- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
11/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Ok
11/08/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 832 8898: I have no any questions
11/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
11/08/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
11/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes I am
11/08/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
11/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 832 8898: That's sounds good
11/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, Takudwa, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
11/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Understood
11/08/23, 2:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.

14/08/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Greetings of the day ma'am!

This is a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *01:30-02:30* PM this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
14/08/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Is everything clear till here?
14/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Yes everything is clear till there
14/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 832 8898: But before we continue I have one question to ask you
14/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Why is it that our sessions are only scheduled for one hour only. Can it not be extended
14/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, this will be done very soon!
And yes, here we step to the beginning of a new journey🌈 <This message was edited>
14/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
14/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
14/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
14/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
14/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
14/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
14/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
14/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Ok I understand it
14/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Monday and Friday

14/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, once you do this do let me know.
14/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 832 8898: I have done it
14/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 832 8898: Since I have chosen Monday and Thursday it simply means that we won't be having sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday right
14/08/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me, no sessions will held tomorrow since our organization will be closed on Tuesday in observance of India's Independence Day🇮🇳
14/08/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This significant day marks the birth of a sovereign India, a result of immense sacrifices and unwavering determination. Vibrant parades, flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural performances, and patriotic fervor color the celebrations across the country. It's a time to reflect on India's journey to self-governance and to honor the leaders who led the struggle for freedom.
14/08/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 832 8898: That's okay ma'am we will resume on Wednesday then

02/09/23, 1:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson, I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
