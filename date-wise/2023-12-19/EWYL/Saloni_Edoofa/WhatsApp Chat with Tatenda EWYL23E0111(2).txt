Through this lesson, I learned that Video blogging, or vlogging, has transformed how we share stories and insights. With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives. Vlogging blends entertainment, education, and authenticity, allowing creators to connect with viewers on a deeper level. From travel escapades to cooking tutorials, vlogging's dynamic nature captures attention, fostering a sense of community and fostering a global conversation through the power of visual storytelling.

In this session, I want to learn what all you grasped about *VIDEO BLOGGING* and yes, *PROJECT UPDATES*

Please make sure you have read both the document carefully:

A. Grant Certificate 
B. FAQ
16/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 349 1035: Noted
16/08/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 067 7692: Greetings of the day
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through the Grant certificate and FAQ?
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 067 7692: Yes ma'am l did that .
16/08/23, 3:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have any concern?
16/08/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 349 1035: Thank you, yes there are some concerns

16/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 349 1035: I understand Tatenda, had be granted a loan for $575 which is split to $175 annually.

In the AAL it states that the grant will be redeemed only in the second semester.
My question is so in the beginning the amount is not to be offered? Since also the earned credits can not be taken together with the grant as we have to select the option with higher financial benefit?
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 349 1035: My question here is how does Edoofa assist in the first semester in terms of tuition fees since no credits can be taken and the grant only works at the second semester?
16/08/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 349 1035: If we fail to meet the deadline for school fees by the university the grant will be correct, how does Edoofa support in that case?
16/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 349 1035: Tatenda has already attained $50 credits before going to India, when he gets there if he works hard, will the credits accumulate from there as he proceeds to earn more up to the end of the semester. 
Will he then make an option to choose between the credits and the  grant?

22/08/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 067 7692: Here is my Saturday activity
22/08/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 067 7692: Some say faith is a state of mind which may be induced by affirmation to the subconscious mind, where it is changed into its spiritual equivalent, that induces a response from infinite intelligence. I, myself don't know much about life, determination, success and l'm not yet an experienced writer but l have faith that this story  will mean a lot to someone, who has once failed .Every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent success, just don't give up and have faith in your self because faith can move mountains . 

It was along time ago in the era of monarchs .The kings proudest of their wealth and queens of their beauty . Their was one lady, who stood above all and redefined the roles of women in her  society and internal politics ,her name was *Queen Anita the Wise* .

If asked about her life's journey , all she remembered was the great shock of her family's death's , the lonely ness and the announcement that she was the next ruler of the people, she remembered the crocodile smiles and gravely cheers which she knew were fake because most nobles wanted her for the own and or sons .They wanted her to fulfill the roles done by her mother and all the ladies around , looked down upon and systematically subordinated and subjected to male power . Anita knew that opportunity comes , it appears in a different form and from a different direction than it is expected she knew that this was her opportunity to live her mark in history and her people's mindset about feminism .Just like every ruler, emperor and king , she promised them a life of their dreams and wealth if only they could support, that was her definite goal and was determined to accomplish that but she had to deal with the critics while minding the back stabbers plotting for her throne .

She was a fan of history and all her life she was taught to serve , listen and comfort .Growing up she felt the misery and despair the peasants felt .All over the country violence was the daily bread while bread , meat and nice cloths were a luxury .This was due to the corrupt nobles and a unjust system, with plenty of selfish people wanting to quench their desires .Some thought the issues were complex for her , the shoes were to big for her but she thought otherwise . She was always on rail to her destination and never looked back .She did what she did best , she listened, served and nurtured all her allies and resources .She signed documents related to the establishment of various constitutional and legal rights . She improved the livelihood of her people by first reduces the criminal activities .The people were impressed by her achievement and slowly began to cooperate .

Her country under her rule enjoyed a period of unparalleled growth and prosperity . A labourer could provide for all the nessesities his family required. They were well clothed in good woollen and silk clothes and had plenty of grain and meat .She become the greatest leader seen by her people . The secret to her success was that she knew the difference between wishing a for a thing and being ready to receive it . She had a definite purpose and stood by that purpose until it had time to became an all consuming obsession .
My last words are life is strange and often imponderable both success and failure have their lesson we need to know before we succeed in anything .Know what you want and the determination to stand to realize it

14/09/23, 4:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tatenda, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from your home country, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to your University in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*
10/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 067 7692: I will surely  do my best to participate

15/11/23, 4:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

09/12/23, 7:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi
