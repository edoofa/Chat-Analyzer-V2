Yes, I have noted it. Thank you and all the best!

Thank you so much
29/08/23, 4:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.
