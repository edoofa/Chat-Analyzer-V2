18/12/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 776 9698: It is giving more details about the first projects Corporate Alliance . The objective of the project is to gain and understanding of the  market i am planning to end up in  in the future and biggin to prepare for it at an early stage , because of the pandemic and the shift towards online work  there is a great opportunity to connect with technically driven and digital companies .
The task of the project will be tk identify such companies in our country or region. For me to do that I have to connect with the family members, friends, neighbors or parents of our friends who work in this sectors sharing objectives and explain how Edoofa is helping me to develop the necessary skills for future employability after graduation. 
Firstly i have to create a LinkedIn account which is a professional networking platform and it allows me to search for companies and allow me to connect with employees. I have to download it on playstore  and I will be helped to create the account. Through LinkedIn I will reach out the managers ,human resource managers and heads if organizations and starting conversations and gathering contact information to set up meeting with Edoofa. The meeting will allow the companies and the Edoofa to discuss the business aspects of this corporate alliance. The document which will be provided will address common questions such as types of companies to target and how to start conversations with influential individuals. Creating a LinkedIn account will help to expand my professional network and even help to create job opportunities in my country.
