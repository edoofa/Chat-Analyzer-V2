01/08/23, 3:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, *Mwaka*. I hope you are doing well.

My name is Ms. Sharda Nayak, and I will be taking forward your EWYL journey from now onwards.
Mr. Maurice won't be able to take your sessions from now onwards as he would be transitioning to a tech role in the near future, but I wanted to make sure that you don't miss out on any learning and earning opportunities.
02/08/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright. Thank you so much for informing. Have a great day.
11/10/23, 8:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning, Mwaka.

I trust you are in good health.

We are now in the month of October, and you completed your college coursework in September. It's time for us to continue with our "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) sessions, starting today. I'd like to set up a session with you from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. This way, we can make the most of our learning and earning opportunities.

Please confirm your availability at your earliest convenience.
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, Mwaka and parents! @260760968079 @260979295072 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams. <This message was edited>

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

07/11/23, 1:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
