06/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 821 3898: <Media omitted>

06/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 821 3898: I'm Milan and I'm 18 years old, doing a combination of Economics, Accounting and Business Studies.

06/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Thank you very much
06/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 821 3898: I think know only one
1. Paying scholarship credits.
06/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Okay
06/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Thank you 😁
06/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
06/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 821 3898: I'm done
06/11/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
06/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Alright good to hear that 🙂
06/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

09/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Alright
09/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
09/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Alright that's great news
09/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, concluding today's session I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Thank you very much! See you soon as well.
14/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

The festive season has come to an end, and we are resuming our EWYL sessions! To kick off our session, I'd like to share how we celebrated Diwali in our office. From decorating our workspace to playing some games, we had a great time!
14/11/23, 1:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 821 3898: I can 🙂☺️
14/11/23, 1:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Alright
14/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
14/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
14/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/11/23, 1:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
14/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Alright I see
14/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 821 3898: I have something to ask?
14/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 821 3898: So as I have done my researches so far I have noticed that the projects that I have can be welly done next first term. In that way I can get effective results.
14/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Most F6 students are no longer available because they have finished their examinations so it is a decision that I thought will be great to plan out very carefully and begin *project 2 and 3 next year* but, I can begin project 1 🙂
14/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let's plan one thing. Let's utilize the time for training and your studies only. Is that alright?
14/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Yes ma'am
14/11/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to move ahead with our discussion. There was a technical glitch. Let us resume our discussion tomorrow at the same time.
14/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 821 3898: It's okay
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Milan!

As we embark on today's learning journey, I'd like to share a quote with you:*_"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."_*

15/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: These are the PDFs and you have to go through with these so that you can master your understaning about the Edoofa schoolarship program. Is that alright?
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Alright 🙂
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You can take your time; we shall connect on Friday. Until then, kindly take a moment to read these documents.
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Okay
15/11/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Due to personal reasons, I won't be available tomorrow. Therefore, we will connect on Friday. I hope to see you there!🚀
17/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings,Milan!

*As we embark on a new day, here's a quote to inspire us: 'Believe you can, and you're halfway there.' -Theodore Roosevelt.*

17/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Milan did you manage to read those two documents I shared with you on Wednesday?
17/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Yes I did
17/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Milan, kindly excuse me for not being able to continue our discussion, as I was engaged in an important conversation with the head of our department, Ms. Sanjana. We discussed how we can help our students acquire quality skills that will make them job-ready.

I am confident that we will generate some brilliant ideas. In the meantime, I would like you to share some unique skills you wish to learn before coming to India! We shall discuss this in our next session, which is on Monday, as we do not have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays." <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Milan! 🌞

Here's a little inspiration to start our day: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue those counts.' - Winston Churchill. Now, let us begin our session with enthusiasm and a quest for knowledge. 📚✨
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Yes indeed 😀

20/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 821 3898: Alright! From the documents you sent me they where explaining Edoofa program in detail. It started with the founders message talking about the reason for Edoofa. I understood that Edoofa was founded with the vision of providing access to quality education to students for this generation and generations to come.  It also talked about the benefits of the program and the courses available and concluded with the student journey to India!
20/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 821 3898: The other one talked about bringing change for a better future. It answered questions usually asked by parents and guardians  and  also shared how Edoofa does it and why!
