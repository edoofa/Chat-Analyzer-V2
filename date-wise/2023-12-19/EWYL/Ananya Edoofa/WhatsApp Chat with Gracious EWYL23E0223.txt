Lately, I've noticed that some of you haven't been consistently following your EWYL ritual on the EWYL line. I want to stress that this small gesture plays a significant role in maintaining your attendance records and ensuring you receive the full benefits of our program.

So, if not done, go and say "I am a proud Edoofian" on your Line. It's not just a phrase; it's a symbol of your commitment to your education and our collective journey.

How are you today?
27/10/23, 3:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, @27846201892 

I'm also curious to learn about your cultural festivals. Why don't you add something about your cultural festival?
27/10/23, 4:30 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Alright i will check if i have some videos..
31/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Parents!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Gracious and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
08/11/23, 5:08 am - +27 84 620 1892: Thank you good morning..
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.

13/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Good morning ma'am
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Yes ma'am it is clear
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okayy
13/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I have understood on the emerging skills that help enhance one's abilities inorder to survive in the future 
I have also managed to understand on the projects offered by Edoofa and the first one being the corporate alliances in which one is supposed to reach out to local organizations in their country arrange a meeting with Edoofa facilitating the signing of a contract 
The second one is community building in which one has to look for youths who have recently finished their high school or who finished within the last six months and refer them to the Edoofa program 
The last one being African Schools Education Reform Mission in which one is required to reach out to local schools and speak to them to collaborate with Edoofa 
And all these projects will help one earn scholarship credits and lower their expenses if correctly done
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to move forward with our discussion. I have been facing some technical challenges today!

However, don't worry; everything will be resolved by tomorrow, and we will move ahead. See you tomorrow! 🌟

14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Gracious!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I would be Vin Diesel and drive as many cars as possible😅
14/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 977 9846: And most probably travel the world
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, that's amazing! Now, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I am done
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
14/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 977 9846: There was summarization on   the first project which is corporate alliances and how one can look for potential companies on LinkedIn 
I also understood on how the projects are able to help me in the future
14/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
14/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I have understood that when looking for a company there are factors to be considered like nature of the company 
It should be student centric ,   recreational or content centric 
The scale and financial stability of the company is also to be considered and there are certain platforms to be used 
And stages on how to carry out the project were given
14/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Gracious, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
14/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Thank you😁
14/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
14/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to

14/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Understood
14/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Gracious, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Gracious!
14/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 977 9846: The audio is more of a summary on the second project which is community building and there are instructions on how the project is to be carried out 
It states that l am to look for students who have recently completed their high school and are willing to study abroad
And there are also instructions on how the process of applying is carried out
14/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude today's session, let's recharge for tomorrow's journey. We'll connect again at 1:30 PM with enthusiasm and dedication. Remember: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill. Looking forward to our continued progress!
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay thank you
See you tomorrow
15/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Gracious!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Good afternoon ma'am 

Wow l really didn't know that 😅
18/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, gracious!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to have a great session today; however, you did not attend your session. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good afternoon Gracious is facing network problems..
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can I know the time I can connect with Gracious?
18/12/23, 2:20 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Let me find out will come back to you.
18/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Good afternoon ma'am
18/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I was facing network challenges
18/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Wow l really didn't know all that😅
18/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Is it stable now?
18/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Yes l think so
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time so that we can proceed with our EWYL projects and earn credits!🌟🎄
18/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay ma'am
