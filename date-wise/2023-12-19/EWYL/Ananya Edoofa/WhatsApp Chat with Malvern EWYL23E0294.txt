I'm absolutely filled with emotions today! Our first batch of 2023 students arrived yesterday morning, and it has been an incredibly busy and overwhelming experience. Meeting these new students for the first time was beyond words, I cannot describe the feeling adequately. I'm now even more thrilled to meet you too! Don't forget to watch the video I'm sharing below; it captures the excitement and enthusiasm we're all experiencing!🌻

03/08/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my students' winter break will be commencing from Friday, which is tomorrow, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step towards their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!

So, I wanted to ask if your winter break has started or not? When would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
03/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 756 9307: Break will be in 2 weeks time
04/08/23, 8:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malvern!

29/08/23, 6:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malvern!

How are you doing?
18/09/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 756 9307: Good morning. Please note that Malvern is a boarder and is at school. He also does not have a phone at school. So he shall only be available after 23 November, which is the last day for his A level exams.
18/09/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 756 9307: As the father, i have been doing most of the communication on his behalf, but i think its better he does it himself. So i advice you put everything on hold until after 23 November.
19/09/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, How are you today?
19/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 756 9307: Fine
19/09/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if we can connect tomorrow for an hour?
19/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 756 9307: May i know whats there tomorrow
19/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 756 9307: Its ok
20/09/23, 7:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: To complete the initial sessions, @263777569307
21/09/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 756 9307: Carry on
21/09/23, 10:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: - I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
21/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 756 9307: Ok noted
21/09/23, 12:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

How are you? Are you ready to move forward with our discussion?
25/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 756 9307: Yes
25/09/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects Malver can and will be a part of.
25/09/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 756 9307: Doesnt this need Malvern himself please. You may wait until he comes back on 23 or 24 November after exams completion
25/09/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Sure! In order to do that you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
25/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 756 9307: You are aware that Malvern is at school and is busy with his exams; he does not have a phone either at the school. I told you all this. So why then should i draft an email again to that effect
25/09/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, however in order to track our students it is important for us to keep a record. Therefore you just have to draft an email so that we can connect Malvern at the given time.
17/11/23, 4:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Malvern!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart.

14/12/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-

14/12/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude today's session, let's recharge for tomorrow's journey. We'll connect again at 8:30 AM with enthusiasm and dedication. Remember: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill. Looking forward to our continued progress!
14/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 541 5773: Thank you sir
15/12/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Malvern!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!

_Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!_🍓🫐
15/12/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 541 5773: Morning sir
15/12/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Malvern, can I know why are you late today?
15/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 541 5773: I was out of bundle so I had to recharge it by buying airtime froma nearby place
15/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 541 5773: Sorry for the lateness sir
15/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
15/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
15/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
15/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
15/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
15/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
15/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

15/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 541 5773: Understood
15/12/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
15/12/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
15/12/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.
