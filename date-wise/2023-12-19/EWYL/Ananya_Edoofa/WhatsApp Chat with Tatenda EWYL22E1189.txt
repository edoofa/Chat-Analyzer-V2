08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

09/12/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 852 8899: I guess ⛅️  clouds
09/12/23, 3:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I hope you have not googled it!🤣
09/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 852 8899: No mam i only said what came to my mind first.
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright! 🌟
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 852 8899: Please share with me
09/12/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
09/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 852 8899: Please tell me what he responded
09/12/23, 5:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
09/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 852 8899: That is why our university asked us to create LinkedIn profiles right?
09/12/23, 5:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely!
09/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
09/12/23, 5:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect for a call next Saturday. Meanwhile, I am sharing your Saturday activity with you.
09/12/23, 5:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Saturday: Let's Practice Microsoft Excel_*

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

*Activity Instructions:*

⭕Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

⭕Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").

13/12/23, 1:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday!_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Guess what? Our team completely understands the holiday excitement mixed with exam stress bubbling inside you. Forget about waiting for Santa – I've got some thrilling news to share!🎄🎁

A serving of holiday cheer is here, as we have decided to disperse your sessions for the next two weeks! During this period, if you ever feel like connecting with me or if I have any updates to share with you, we can connect between 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm. So, make sure to spare a few minutes to acknowledge.🧑🏽‍🎄

We will resume our sessions in the first week of January. During this break, I encourage you to focus on your studies, enjoy the celebrations, and approach the exams with confidence. All the best and have fun! 🏆✨
