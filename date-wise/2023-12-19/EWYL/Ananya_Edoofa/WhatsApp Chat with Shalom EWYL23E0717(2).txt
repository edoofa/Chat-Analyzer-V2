05/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You mentioned that you would be available today; however, you were not here on time.

05/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK Ms Ananya
06/10/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 683 2254: No I don't understand what the two objectives are Ms Ananya
06/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Thank you Ms Ananya I've now understood what the two objectives are all about
06/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
06/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 683 2254: I've read the screenshot Ms Ananya 

It's nice to know that one can earn so much through the EWYL program 


And I would also want to earn such through hardwork and determination
06/10/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
06/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK Ms Ananya 
I'm ready to start to start thre EWYL journey with the help of you, Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana
06/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 683 2254: This message was deleted
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you have read the document or not?
06/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 683 2254: I've read the document Ms Ananya 

And l must say I'm also lucky to be part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and l would also one day want to be sharing my story of my Edoofa program with other Scholars like Ms Swarna Akhter has done
06/10/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly share your understaning with me before our next session. Our next session is on Monday. We do not have our sessions on Saturdays and Sundays. 

Happy Weekend!🌸
06/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 683 2254: What I've understood from the document is that 
One must learn to use time wisely and that the decisions we make have an impact on our daily lives and future . I also got some quotes that motivated me to shape my future and also learnt something through Mr Angad Singh story 


I also got the background of the Edoofa Scholarship founder Mr Angad Singh
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Same to you Ms Ananya 

Have a happy weekend🌺

After school, once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
10/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/10/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shalom!

There are three projects, I think you missed the last project.
11/10/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: You have to work on all of these; however, as of now, we have put the first project on hold. Once we resume, we will work on this together.

I'm ready
12/10/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Shalom, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
12/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK noted Ms Ananya will surely do so
12/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 683 2254: So what's the next step of our session
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay Ms Ananya have taken note of the timing of my sessions but l have a bit of a challenge with keeping up with that time as I will  at school from 7:30am to 4pm and phones ain't allowed at school
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK Ms Ananya
12/10/23, 4:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. Would you like to temporarily pause our sessions until you've completed your exams, or would you prefer to continue with the new schedule?
14/10/23, 10:08 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Good evening Ms Ananya I've sent the emails
19/10/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Take a little break, relax, and let this video inspire and motivate you. You've got this! 💪
Wishing you all the best of luck with your exams! Stay focused and keep shining. ✨
29/11/23, 12:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shalom! @263786832254 @263772968339 

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my student's exams are over now, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step toward their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!

I'm delighted to inform you that we have made another step towards our focus on employability and have effectively organized a series of webinars featuring a few  amazing speakers from Africa🤩 that our students in India have received the opportunity to attend. 

This effort ensures that our students are provided with abundant opportunities and exposure to enrich their learning experiences.🚀

Our recent webinars have covered job-ready skills, 21st-century skills- communication, networking, and more, and key focus topics like plagiarism awareness and CV building.
02/12/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Guess what?🤔 Four of our Proud Edoofians recently landed paid internships only with their active participation and learning under the dedicated guidance of our Career Development Officer, Mr. Anik.💼

Here is a sneak peek of our incredibly informative webinars! 🌟

We cannot wait to hear your thoughts!

I also do believe that dreams do come true as long as you are focused and working towards on reaching your goal ,despite of who you are ,and where you come as those factors don't determine where you are going or what you will be in the future 


All that's needed is 

Focus
Determination 
Resilence 
Purpose
05/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Shalom!

I trust your exams went smoothly. Congratulations on completing this phase!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
08/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shalom!

11/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It is so disappointing that even after constant reminders and pre-scheduling your sessions, you have missed today's session. Trust me, attending your sessions regularly with your mentor has a big impact on your performance. We analyze these sessions and engagement while evaluating your performance. Not attending the sessions is an alarming situation, so can I know the reason behind your absence?
11/12/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Good evening Ms Ananya 

I'm soooooo sorry for missing today's session but I didn't do it intentionally had run out of data


Just got connected to an internet now

I'm so sorry
11/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 683 2254: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Thank you for sharing the video link Ms Ananya it helped 

As I now have a clue on how to make a good CV
12/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Good afternoon Ms Ananya
12/12/23, 1:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shalom!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Lol sure Ms Ananya I'm ready to dive into our session with the octopus energy
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, did you get a chance to read the following document?
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Yes I did Ms Ananya
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay Ms Ananya 

What I understood from the document is that l got hints that the companies that I'm supposed to collaborate with in relation to my Edoofa Scholarship should be Student Centric meaning that companies that focus on the needs of the student "Student-centric" companies are businesses that focus on meeting the needs of students. This can include companies that offer products or services specifically for students, like student loans or student discounts. It can also include companies that make an effort to support and empower students in other ways, like providing opportunities for internships or mentorship. The goal of student-centric companies is to help students succeed and thrive, both in their education and in their careers. It's a growing trend in the business world, and more companies are looking for ways to cater to the student population.


And that l must take note of the company employees range from 50 - 200

Must have knowledge of their salary wages
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 683 2254: And must have knowledge about the company's  founder
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Sorry for late reply got network issues
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 683 2254: And that I must check if the company Is looking for some interns 


And the other steps are clear Ms Ananya I don't have any queries
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Shalom, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.🌟🌟
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 683 2254: ☺️lol I'm happy to hear you say that Ms Ananya

13/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shalom!

Let us begin our session with one of my favorite quotes: _'Every day is a fresh start, a new beginning. Seize it with optimism and determination, for even the smallest steps lead to great journeys.'_🌸
13/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Thanks for sharing such a encouraging quote miss Ananya
13/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 683 2254: So what are we going to be focusing on today
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK please do Ms Ananya
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay Ms Ananya noted 

Will do the following steps
13/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 683 2254: So l will have to be guiding tha applicants about the Edoofa Scholarship in the group that l would have created 
Not I'm their inboxes
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
13/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
13/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

13/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
13/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

And then reach out to the principals about my Edoofa journey and set up a call between the school authorities 

And tell them why l joined the Edoofa program 
And then l have to share the principals number with my mentor  after I had set up an online meeting between school principal and Edoofa  program director
13/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 683 2254: May l please have the form that l will use to initiate a conversation with my principal
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to move forward with our discussion. I have been facing some technical challenges today!

However, don't worry; everything will be resolved by tomorrow, and we will move ahead. See you tomorrow! 🌟
14/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shalom!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Good afternoon Ms Ananya
14/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Ooh, what a fun question! There are so many possibilities, but I think I'd love to spend a day in the life of Hermione Granger from the Harry Potter books. I'd spend the day studying magic at Hogwarts, exploring the castle and grounds, hanging out with Harry, Ron, and the rest of the gang, and maybe even have an adventure in Hogsmeade. Plus, I'd get to see all the fantastic beasts and mystical creatures that exist in the wizarding world. It would be a day full of excitement, wonder, and magic.
14/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hermione Granger is a great choice Shalom!

14/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

14/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 683 2254: OK noted 

I did create a group
14/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great!
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

15/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Good afternoon Ms Ananya


These are the students that have understood the Edoofa Scholarship Program processes and are willing to enroll under the scholarship
15/12/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Shalom!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 683 2254: 😆I see 

Thank you for sharing your knowledge about bananas and berries Ms Ananya
15/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
15/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay noted Ms Ananya
15/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
15/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Q1: THE SCIENCE INSTITUTE TRUST 
ONCE HEARD OUR SCHOOL OWNER MRS HOVE SAY THAT SHE HAS ONCE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH SOME OFFICIALITIES OF THE EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM



Q2: The message that I will use to reach out to the school heads are ;
- The benefits of the scholarship program for students, such as financial assistance, career development opportunities, and networking.
- The prestige of the scholarship program and the quality of the institution offering it.
- The impact the scholarship program could have on the school's reputation.
- The benefits the school could receive from the scholarship program, such as funding, publicity, and connections.
- The potential for the scholarship program to attract new students to the school.
- How the scholarship program could help the school meet its strategic goals.


Q3: Matabeleland North
15/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
15/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay 

As of now I don't have the contact 

But will make sure I have the contact before the end of the day
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay Ms Ananya
15/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 683 2254: So once l get the school head's number should l create a group of me  ,you and her 

Or l will personally be communicating with her
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: No, you do not have to create a group; you just have to convey the information to the school head and schedule a call with our program director by asking him to fill out the school form.
15/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay noted
15/12/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Shalom we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on! <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay 


I have one question in regards to the project that requires me to approach a certain company and then link then set up a meeting 


Can the meeting be done by an employee or l have to set it up with a specific shareholder
15/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Shalom! Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
15/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay Ms Ananya 
Will be focusing on project 2 and 3 then .
15/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
15/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay will do so Ms Ananya 

Communication is the key after all ,lol
15/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday-  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
15/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.
15/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: "I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
15/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay 

NOTED MS ANANYA
15/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on tuesday

Meanwhile, I'd like to give you a small target as a fresher: try connecting with 4-5 students under your community-building project and submit their application forms. As it's your first time, this will help you understand the process and potential challenges. Feel free to share any difficulties you encounter so that we can address them together when we reconvene on Tuesday.🌟
15/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Okay Ms Ananya will do so
15/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 683 2254: Have a blessed day ✨
18/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Shalom!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to have a great session today; however, you did not attend your session. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
18/12/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 683 2254: This message was deleted
