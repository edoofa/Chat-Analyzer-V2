28/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 549 8011: Historical novels
28/11/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, so have you ever read about the Indian History?

28/11/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, if you like reading about history, you should also consider reading about Indian history!
28/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok l will thank you
28/11/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that some other people have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
28/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 549 8011: They're my parents right now they're at work
28/11/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 210 6331: Good morning everyone, my name is Eckwell Mlambo. I am Thandoluhle 's  father . I am pleased to be on this program
28/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 549 8011: No l don't understand
28/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: It is nice to connect with you,@263772106331
28/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok thank you ma'am l understand
28/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 77 210 6331: Thank you
28/11/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/11/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, before we sign off, here's a quick one for you: Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything! 😄 Anyway, it was great chatting with you today. 

Let's catch up again tomorrow at the same time, 8:30 AM. Take care and see you soon!
28/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok thank you ma'am
28/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 549 8011: Thank you ma'am have a great day
29/11/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Thandoluhle!

As we embark on our session, here's another intriguing fact about India: The country is not only known for its diverse cultures but also for being home to the *world's highest cricket ground*. At an altitude of 2,444 meters, the Chail Cricket Ground in Himachal Pradesh provides a breathtaking setting for the sport. 🏏🏞️
29/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 549 8011: Good morning to you too ma'am .... It really is a great country
29/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed,  I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/11/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am , yes it sounds interesting
29/11/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/11/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am thank you
29/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 549 8011: I'm done ma'am
29/11/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Our session time has come to an end. Let's conclude our discussions here and reconvene tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. for another insightful session. Kindly let me know what exactly did you learn from the newsletter before our next session.

Before we go, as a follow-up to our talk about the *world's highest cricket ground in India*, I've found an amazing picture to share. Take a look!

I look forward to our continued exploration and learning. Until then, have a great day!
29/11/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 549 8011: Thank you ma'am have a great day
30/11/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Thandoluhle!

Let's start our today's session with a smile: Why did the bicycle fall over?

Because it was two-tired! 😄
30/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 549 8011: Good morning ma'am
30/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 549 8011: I'm ready
30/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 549 8011: From the newsletter l learnt that culture is a thing that we can exchange among ourselves as human beings to knock aside our differences and build upon our similarities 

Culture is important and culture connects different people
30/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thandoluhle, why are you late?
30/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 549 8011: I'm at school ma'am sorry I'm late l was in a lesson
30/11/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
30/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 549 8011: It sounds great thank you ma'am
30/11/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?

30/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 549 8011: I'm done ma'am
30/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 549 8011: I have understood that the world is changing due to challenges faced in the world such as the Corona pandemic made business people work online and advertise their things online 

Enduring skills are skills that require a high degree of creativity, emotional intelligence and strategic thinking

There are also things that a machine cannot do which includes relationship building , risk taking and decision making .

Acquiring skills and enhancing our abilities is the only way for us to survive in the future

Earn while you learn program helps students to be able to directly impact society and the economy .

01/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 549 8011: On co-operate alliance my aim here is to understand the market l am going to work in the future and start preparing myself for it at a very early stage .

There is a great chance to connect with different companies as now in the world people work online .

I should identify companies iny country including my family members , neighbors and my friend's parents who work in the service sector and tell them about my objectives and how l am enrolled in Edoofa and how it is going to help me in future

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝

06/12/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Thandoluhle!

Let us begin our today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 549 8011: A keyboard
06/12/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, bright child!🚀
06/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 549 8011: Thank you ma'am
06/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 549 8011: Good morning ma'am
06/12/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,  Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you! <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am
06/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
06/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
06/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
06/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
06/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
06/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
06/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

06/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am
06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
06/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

06/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 549 8011: No ma'am I don't have any questions
06/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 549 8011: So ma'am if someone fills the offline application l have to send it back to this group or what do l do

07/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Thandoluhle!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 549 8011: 😀😀 thank you ma'am l didn't know

07/12/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: ​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
07/12/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available.

07/12/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am
07/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
07/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am l will look for his contact

07/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 549 8011: Ok ma'am thank you

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.

08/12/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Thandoluhle!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.

With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.

As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!

All the best!
