I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. I am writing to inform you that, unfortunately, I won't be able to conduct tomorrow's session as planned. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

The reason for my absence is that my mother is in town, and I have been granted a day off to spend quality time with her. Family is important to me, and I appreciate your understanding in allowing me this time to be with her.

It is time for your session.
10/08/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 690 1195: I thought you said we are now using EWYL  Line
10/08/23, 1:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, But we are not yet done here.
10/08/23, 1:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
10/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 690 1195: Okay l understand
10/08/23, 1:42 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please share this in the Line.
10/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 690 1195: Okay l sent the message already
10/08/23, 1:49 pm - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
10/08/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 690 1195: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 1:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: The spelling of Edoofian is wrong.
10/08/23, 1:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
10/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 690 1195: Okay l don't have any queries for now
10/08/23, 2:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: I hope you have received the Wednesday lesson, Please submit your understanding of the same in the EWYL line before your session. From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discuss and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.
Great day to you.
10/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 690 1195: Not yet l think it's network
10/08/23, 2:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, I have shared it in the Line.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

31/10/23, 6:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
