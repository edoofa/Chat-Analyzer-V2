11/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Natasha!

Before diving into today's session, I want to share a few highlights with you from the recent webinar that took place for our students here in India!🌟

https://www.instagram.com/p/C0jSIPrvg_1/
11/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Natasha, I was hoping to connect with you at our scheduled time. May I ask if everything is alright? Are you facing any challenges?
11/12/23, 3:42 pm - +260 95 7783862: Sorry I was just a little bit busy
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Natasha!

Did you know octopuses have three hearts and blue blood? Two pumps to the gills, and one to the body. They're basically the rockstars of the ocean with a unique sense of style! Now, let's dive into our session with that octopus energy!🐙
13/12/23, 6:02 am - +260 95 7783862: Good morning
13/12/23, 6:03 am - +260 95 7783862: Sorry I haven’t been able to attend any of the sessions we had a power cut therefore making it difficult to connect with you
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Natasha!

Let us begin our session with one of my favorite quotes: _'Every day is a fresh start, a new beginning. Seize it with optimism and determination, for even the smallest steps lead to great journeys.'_🌸
13/12/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand that an electrical problem could be a major issue. However, if you think we can connect through another means, please let me know. It's the second day that you haven't attended your EWYL sessions with me, and I'm concerned that we might be off to a challenging start. I believe staying on track is crucial, so I'd appreciate any updates.
14/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Natasha!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, may I know if you are facing any challenges?
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - +260 95 7783862: Still having electricity power cuts
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - +260 95 7783862: But I’ll be available tomorrow
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - +260 95 7783862: I’m so sorry for the inconvenience
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand that electricity is a major issue. Could you let me know if there is a specific time duration when there are no such problems? Alternatively, I am open to extending the session duration so that you don't lag behind.
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - +260 95 7783862: We can have the session from  9:30 AM to 10:30 AM
14/12/23, 4:19 pm - +260 95 7783862: If that’s okay with you??
14/12/23, 4:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Natasha, well, it would be difficult for me to accommodate you during that time as I have some other commitments. Can we connect at 8:30 a.m. in the morning?
14/12/23, 4:51 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes
15/12/23, 8:40 am - +260 95 7783862: Good morning mentor
15/12/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Natasha!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!

_Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!_🍓🫐
15/12/23, 8:41 am - +260 95 7783862: Yes!
15/12/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/12/23, 8:45 am - +260 95 7783862: No can you tell me
15/12/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 95 7783862: Okay
15/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 95 7783862: I understand
15/12/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/12/23, 8:56 am - +260 95 7783862: Thank you!
15/12/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 95 7783862: Yes
15/12/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/12/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:09 am - +260 95 7783862: This is so interesting
15/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
15/12/23, 9:11 am - +260 95 7783862: The quotes
15/12/23, 9:11 am - +260 95 7783862: And the questions
15/12/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 9:12 am - +260 95 7783862: Very good!
15/12/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
15/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:13 am - +260 95 7783862: Yes
15/12/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
15/12/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:33 am - +260 95 7783862: I am through with this one
15/12/23, 9:36 am - +260 95 7783862: This one is refusing to load

15/12/23, 9:40 am - +260 95 7783862: I have already gone through this one

15/12/23, 9:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 10:18 am - +260 95 7783862: I am through with this one as well
15/12/23, 10:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
15/12/23, 10:37 am - +260 95 7783862: So to earn scholarship credits I’ll need to build a strong network on behalf of Edoofa with other countries
15/12/23, 10:37 am - +260 95 7783862: And I’ll also learn other skills which can help in getting a job
15/12/23, 10:38 am - +260 95 7783862: And every time I introduce someone to the edoofa program it also adds to my scholarship credits
15/12/23, 11:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
15/12/23, 11:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 11:18 am - +260 95 7783862: What’s the aim for the LinkedIn page??

15/12/23, 4:45 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes

18/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Natasha, may I ask if you were able to read the document I shared with you last time?
18/12/23, 1:42 pm - +260 95 7783862: Yes I was
18/12/23, 1:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
18/12/23, 1:47 pm - +260 95 7783862: As an edoofa I will represent edoofa to build a network of partner employees and potential employers this will also create strong professional network to earn scholarships

18/12/23, 2:04 pm - +260 95 7783862: After they fill this in I’m I supposed to send it to you??
18/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes! <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - +260 95 7783862: Okay
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
