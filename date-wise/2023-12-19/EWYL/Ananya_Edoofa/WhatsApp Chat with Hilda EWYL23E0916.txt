11/12/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Thank you so much, let's connect on Friday
15/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Hilda!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐 <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Good afternoon
16/12/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Hilda!

I hope you are doing well. I was expecting to hear from you yesterday, but you did not respond. Can I know if you are facing any challenges?
16/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 579 2587: I was facing network challenges I had traveled
18/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Hilda!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to have a great session today; however, you did not attend your session. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
18/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 579 2587: I'm not facing any challenges
18/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Then? Why were you not there during your session time?
18/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 579 2587: I was facing internet challenges on the day. I was out of town
18/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hilda, I want to highlight that you must have signed a document for completing your orientation sessions with us in order to proceed smoothly with your admissions procedure. However, there has been a significant lapse in terms of the duration. I would recommend that you dedicate yourself to attending a few sessions so that we can complete our initial orientation without any disruption.
18/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Okay
18/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can _actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!

18/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: By the way, I was having a conversation with the admissions team, and I came to know that you are about to receive an offer letter from the university! How are you feeling? Are you excited?
18/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Surely I am
18/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, that's great! I hope that you will get the university of your dreams!🌟
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Sure
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 579 2587: No
18/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
18/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
18/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Okay got it
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time so that we can proceed with our EWYL projects and earn credits!🌟🎄
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Thank you, have a great day
