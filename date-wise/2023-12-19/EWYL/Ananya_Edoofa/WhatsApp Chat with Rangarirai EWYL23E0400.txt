01/08/23, 10:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to my proud Edifonian!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately. You know I was so excited in preparing for the arrival of my students! However, here I am.
01/08/23, 11:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
01/08/23, 11:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
01/08/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 889 2415: Thank you for the emphasis on scholarship credits i now understand more
01/08/23, 11:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
01/08/23, 11:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 889 2415: Oooh wow he is doing it i hope i will be like them
01/08/23, 12:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
01/08/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 889 2415: It's nice to meet you Ms Davi and Ms Deepali
01/08/23, 12:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
01/08/23, 12:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok
01/08/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 889 2415: It is really inspiring. As for myself reading books was not my thing, i had little interest in them but now i am looking forward to remove that mentality and try my best to read them because it seems that its really helpful and can catalyse personal growth
01/08/23, 1:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's amazing, Rangarirai
01/08/23, 1:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude our session here! We shall now connect in our next session tomorrow at 8:30AM to discuss this ! See you!

11/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
11/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 889 2415: From this document i have managed to gather and summerize few things. COVID-19 affected the world, career experts and various 
reports are predicting 25 million job
losses due to recession hitting the economy, Therefore we need to be aware of how future jobs look like and aquire skills that are required to perform these future jobs. Online/ Digital Skills & Literacy, Social Media Literacy, data Analytics and remote team-work are some of the skills only to mention the few. Now, Edoofa came up with projects that will help their students aquire these skills while learning. In this document three projects were highlighted and well explained.

 *Project : Corporate Alliances*
 Edoofians will represent Edoofa to build a network of
partner companies and potential employers. This will help them create a
strong professional network and earn scholarship credits. This helps students to gain skills like networking and good communication

 *Project 2: Community building* 
Students will reach out to their personal and extended networks and offer
them an opportunity to be a part of Edoofa’s educational ecosystem and acquire International
education which prepares them for the future. This opportunity must reach every youth who is
motivated and has the zeal to create great careers. Edoofians will have gained networking skills and persuasion skill also

 *Project 3: African schools education reform mission* 
Students will reach out to Local Schools in their local region and
will speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. Students will have gain confidence and communication skills in this project.
11/08/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well done, Rangarirai! I must say, none of my other students have ever explained the document so thoroughly before!🌟
11/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Thank you ma'am
11/08/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/08/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok

11/08/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/08/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 889 2415: First all you must have an account on LinkedIn, connect with decision makers of the company and also the employees, take their contact numbers and set up a meeting with Edoofa. Connecting to the companies will help us to explore in networking and it also exposes us to industrial environment
11/08/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks . I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

21/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 889 2415: *African schools education reform mission*

 This project gives students an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the Edoofa program. A student will reach local schools and talk to the responsible authority ( headmasters or principals) about the Edoofa program. Whatsapp calls may also be used to communicate with these headmasters. The next step is to set up a meeting with the Edoofa director so that they explore a lot about the program
21/08/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations . However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
21/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 889 2415: So far everything seems clear but an question arises i won't hesitate to ask for your clarity
21/08/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
21/08/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
21/08/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
21/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 71 889 2415: Follow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/FRzVVhR3rfFAtpUIVvFkdc

21/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 889 2415: Yes ma'am i can't wait
May you please go ahead and tell me
21/08/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.

21/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 889 2415: Oooh wow that will be wonderful
21/08/23, 9:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
21/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 889 2415: Ooh okay i am following
21/08/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳
