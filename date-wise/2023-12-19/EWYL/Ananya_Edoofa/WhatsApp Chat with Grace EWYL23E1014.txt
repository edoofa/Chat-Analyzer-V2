Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨ <This message was edited>

18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - +260 765306528: What are they?
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
18/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +260 765306528: Okayy
18/12/23, 2:22 pm - +260 765306528: I understand
18/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/12/23, 2:26 pm - +260 765306528: Noted
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - +260 96 8421014: We are together fir sure am following  too.
18/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time so that we can proceed with our EWYL projects and earn credits!🌟🎄
