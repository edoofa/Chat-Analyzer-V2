13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Phelistas!

14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Phelistas!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?

15/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Phelistas!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 240 7949: I will not eat berries, but boss I need an Iphone 7 from India soonest, good day
16/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 240 7949: You did not respond when I was waiting, what then
16/12/23, 1:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263772407949 

I hope you are aware that our session duration is only one hour. If you join in the latter of that time, it will be challenging for us to complete our session in a fruitful manner. I trust you understand that attending sessions on time is crucial for earning credits.
I expect a level of sincerity from a dedicated student like you. Moving forward, I hope you will connect with me promptly at 1:30 p.m.
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Am now connected sir  and ready
16/12/23, 1:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since we do not have our sessions on weekends, let us connect on Monday at 8:30 a.m. I am so excited to begin our EWYL journey! So, do join the session on time and bring a lot of energy! <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 240 7949: But sir you did not begin with a story

18/12/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Phelistas!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨

18/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
18/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 240 7949: Great mum I have read a lot about Winston Churchill but did not know this thank you for the News Letter have gained mum
