19/09/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, you are already aware of the EWYL Program. If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.

19/09/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 5210212: This message was deleted
19/09/23, 4:30 pm - +260 97 5210212: It is an Edoofa backbone program to make university education affordable. Basically a student is given live online projects, during which they gain excellent work experience while earning credits equivalent to physical cash based on students performance.Then the credits are used to pay a significant part of higher education fee.
20/09/23, 2:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well

Kindly connect with within our scheduled time so that we can finish our training and discussion.
It is important that we respect the scheduled timing.

May I also know what is the exact challenge that you are not able to connect with me at our scheduled time?
20/09/23, 8:30 am - +260 97 5210212: Good morning Sharda,I thought you already knew that  Hope is in school now and they are not allowed to use phones.I am the mother, i am a nurse so sometimes it's difficult to attend to the agreed engagement time  because of the nature of my work otherwise I will try or if it's ok we can reschedule 8pm -10pm.
20/09/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: I understand your concern Ma'am. But shifting the timing to 8pm-10pm will not be possible at my end as there is a time difference of 3 and a half hours in India.

Also, regarding being late for the sessions. I have a scheduled timing for the sessions and then i get occupied in some other work. 
But, do not worry. If you want we can connect from 9:30 am in the morning if that suits you?
20/09/23, 9:02 am - +260 97 5210212: Ok I'll try to avail my self
20/09/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Ma'am Noted.
20/09/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
20/09/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
20/09/23, 9:12 am - +260 97 5210212: I go for the first slot, will try my best to attend. But for now Hope may will not come back home until month-end November,so I don't know if I can still attend the session for her.
20/09/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, you can aatend the basic training sessions for her. When she will be back we can start discussion with her as well.
20/09/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: This is a brief 3 day long  session specially for parents and you can brief her later.
20/09/23, 9:23 am - +260 97 5210212: Ok am set, thanks
21/09/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well

Are you ready for the session?
21/09/23, 8:39 am - +260 97 5210212: Good morning Sharda,yes I am ready
21/09/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/09/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 5210212: Kindly enlighten
21/09/23, 9:09 am - +260 97 5210212: Maybe to help students gain experience while they learn and help students earn credits that are equivalent to physical cash used to pay for their university education. Y
21/09/23, 9:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Hope is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
21/09/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
21/09/23, 9:55 am - +260 97 5210212: I have read through and I have understood
21/09/23, 9:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
21/09/23, 9:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/09/23, 9:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:08 am - +260 97 5210212: That's was great, and how much time did it take?
21/09/23, 10:11 am - +260 97 5210212: Does the number of credits depend on the type of tasks given or they are  earned regardless
22/09/23, 8:44 am - +260 97 5210212: Good morning
22/09/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well

Are you available for the session?
22/09/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Number of credits are fixed for each task.
If a student performs, then he/she is given the credits.
22/09/23, 9:07 am - +260 97 5210212: Thanks,yes I am available
22/09/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
22/09/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/09/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Hope* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/09/23, 9:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion?
22/09/23, 9:29 am - +260 97 5210212: Yes sounds interesting and gives room to attend to other activities
22/09/23, 9:38 am - +260 97 5210212: Yes please
22/09/23, 9:39 am - +260 97 5210212: I meant activities while you are on the EWYL program
22/09/23, 10:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
22/09/23, 10:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Hope* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/09/23, 10:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 10:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Hope’S EWYL journey:
22/09/23, 10:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Hope* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
22/09/23, 10:27 am - +260 97 5210212: Done
22/09/23, 11:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay

25/09/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Hope* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
25/09/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits

2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency

25/09/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *Hope* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.
25/09/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

07/12/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: *As we embark on today's session, let's kick-start our journey with a dose of inspiration from Jeff Bezos, the visionary founder of Amazon:*
*_Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room_*

Now, what does this mean to you?

Imagine you're creating your personal brand every day. It's not just about how you see yourself; it's about the impression you leave on others. Whether you're in the classroom, chatting with friends, or pursuing your hobbies, you're shaping your brand—the way people perceive you.
So, let's dive into today's session with the mindset of crafting a brand that reflects your strengths, values, and aspirations. Together, we'll explore ways to amplify your unique qualities and set the stage for success, not just academically, but in every aspect of your lives.
Remember, each interaction, each achievement, contributes to your brand. Let's make it a story of growth, resilience, and positive impact!
07/12/23, 8:30 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we move ahead, kindly share your understanding of the quote.
07/12/23, 8:45 am - +260 97 6845595: Communities building involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment,  where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to associate with others in that community. It also involves having a similar sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
07/12/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
07/12/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: *In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.*  
Here is the message -
07/12/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/12/23, 10:03 am - +260 97 6845595: Q1. Ibenga girls' secondary school
-the school is connected with Edoofa
07/12/23, 10:17 am - +260 97 6845595: The Edoofa scholarship program is an Indian based scholarship program that offers high-quality education to international students. Once the program is introduced to pupils, it opens a door of great opportunities for them to reach greater heights in the future. When the program was introduced to me, I immediately took up the opportunity. It is a program that assures people that success in just at their fingertips.
07/12/23, 10:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
07/12/23, 10:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
07/12/23, 10:20 am - +260 97 6845595: I agree
07/12/23, 10:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

07/12/23, 10:21 am - +260 97 6845595: I'm ready
07/12/23, 10:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Hope, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*

07/12/23, 10:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.


The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
*So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:*

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
