19/10/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Parent and Kirsty @263713383861 

I trust you are in good health.

I understand that *Kirsty* is currently occupied with ongoing exams, and I want to ensure my student doesn't miss out on any valuable learning opportunities. Therefore, I'd like to share today's weekly newsletter, which you can review at your convenience.
19/10/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, Tafadzwa and parents! @263713383861 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

31/10/23, 5:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Kirsty @263713383861 
I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

21/11/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 338 3861: Yes ma'am
21/11/23, 2:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am waiting for you to share your understanding Kirsty.
21/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 338 3861: On how to connect with companies..we must look on the various social media platforms of the company like LinkedIn,Facebook. They help to see about of the company, the founder of the company ( does he have a profound foundation on growing the company) . We also have to look for the employee range of the company. Also we must also check.we must also understand the main aim of the company ,what's it about. To do this we can send an invitation note to the heads using LinkedIn
21/11/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You know what Kirsty, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
21/11/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

21/11/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 338 3861: What's an MOU
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: MOU stands for "Memorandum of Understanding." Think of it like a special agreement between two people, organizations, or groups. It's not as formal or official as a contract, but it still shows that they agree on certain things and plan to work together on something.
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 338 3861: Okay understood
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now?
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 338 3861: Yes ma'am
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING
21/11/23, 2:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Kirsty!

29/11/23, 1:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You can go through this audio after our session today.
29/11/23, 1:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
29/11/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
29/11/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
29/11/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

I hope you are doing well.

This week, I will share with you your *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*
