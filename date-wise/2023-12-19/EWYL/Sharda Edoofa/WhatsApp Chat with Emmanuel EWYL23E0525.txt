25/08/23, 12:24 pm - ~ Tenzin Tsomo ~ Mentor added you
28/08/23, 4:10 pm - +265 993 17 75 43 and +265 999 31 88 35 were added
28/08/23, 7:47 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Ooh thanks for the introduction. And I've zero problems from the video it is loud and clear.
29/08/23, 7:59 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
 Before we begin understanding the projects and what we will be doing in the EWYL program, I would like to inform you that we will be meeting every weekday, Monday to Friday, from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. (Zimbabwe time).
Feel free to express if you have problems regarding the timings so that I can reschedule it so that you can be present and maximize your learning opportunities. Let's have a productive and successful journey.
29/08/23, 9:45 am - +265 993 17 75 43: Ok I'll be available
29/08/23, 1:30 pm - +91 78273 08969: It is time for your session.
29/08/23, 1:38 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Am here
29/08/23, 1:39 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/08/23, 1:41 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: No I don't may you please tell me!!
29/08/23, 1:47 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/08/23, 1:51 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Wow that's nice. Yes it's true that we students want to reduce fees expenses and I have high hopes that the EWYL will help us in doing so.
29/08/23, 1:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/08/23, 1:54 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Ok I  can't wait to here much from them also.
29/08/23, 1:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Emmanuel?
29/08/23, 2:01 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: *Wow that's nice to hear. Thanks for letting me know the goals that you have set*
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Not really that's means I have to be doing something like homework. So will you be the one to choose the days?? 
Otherwise it's ok
29/08/23, 2:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: We will decide the dates after our onboarding phase.
29/08/23, 2:38 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Ok I'll be waiting to hear it from your team.
29/08/23, 2:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/08/23, 2:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

29/08/23, 3:32 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
29/08/23, 3:40 pm - +91 78273 08969: Tomorrow marks a festive day in India 🇮🇳 – a joyous celebration of the special bond shared between brothers and sisters, known as Raksha Bandhan. 🎉 As a result, our organization will remain closed for the day. 
Hence, we will not have the sessions tomorrow.
29/08/23, 3:47 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: The whole of it I like it. But the most  liked part are the quotes
29/08/23, 3:47 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Thanks for letting us know about that!!

08/09/23, 12:48 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: Sime of the understandings of the long document in simple terms r:

✓The most important thing is to merge awareness and skills to face the new wrld wether negatively or positively to accomplish the career goal since other skills are enduring

✓The digital platform can not be overemphasized in our digital aga since almost business communicate or trade digitally. All these platforms uses data that's why data is now the hub of all digital on communication hence enduring skills are non separable e.g. networking, decision making etc.
All these are able to prepare me for a 21st century new age skills to approach the world market employability in return have impact on the society and the family.😶
08/09/23, 4:25 pm - +91 78273 08969: Please shed some light on the projects mentioned in the document.
08/09/23, 5:57 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: *project 1*
- I should be able to create skills how to approach influential people in society
- never give up attitudes on any rejections, failures
- small contribution I can make will have deep impact in society
- in activity 2. It's about creating a working platform
- in activity 3. Is about procedures and communication skills.
All the activities are to prepare me acquire skills and connection that are mine forever while gaining scholarship credits.
08/09/23, 6:00 pm - +265 993 17 75 43: *project 2 & 3*
Is about sensitising the Edoofa programs to the community sell the programs to the general public e.g. senior secondary schools
- then get scholarship credits
- these will help me acquire enduring skills and professional communication skills
*÷then develop a never give up attitude÷* ✌️
08/09/23, 6:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is good.
08/09/23, 6:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
08/09/23, 6:07 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

29/09/23, 10:45 am - +91 78273 08969: Dear Emmanuel,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday.

11/10/23, 8:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *Emmanuel* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. <This message was edited>

11/10/23, 9:05 am - +265 999 31 88 35: Sharda, am I loosing track. I remember to have said that Emmanuel has gone back to school hence am taking his session on his behalf. The school management doesn't allow any cellphone hence he is out of communication. Advise me do you want him online on stated days. I stated this to Tenzin before she quit the session.
11/10/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: I can see there was some confusion, but no need to worry. We initially had you, as a parent, attend primary training sessions on Immanuel's behalf while he was in school.

However, now we've decided to pause these sessions until Immanuel returns from school. In the meantime, we will continue to share resources to ensure that no learning opportunities are missed. I hope this clarifies the situation.
11/10/23, 9:26 am - +265 999 31 88 35: That means am not taking any session on his behalf as earlier arranged. I will be happy if other communication and resources are not missed because I have come from far with the program and just to lose the learning opportunity at this far
12/10/23, 8:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning!
I hope you are doing really well.

           So, are you ready to start our session?
16/10/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning!
I hope you are doing really well.

           So, are you ready to start our session?

18/10/23, 8:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Emmanuel
18/10/23, 8:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you are doing well
18/10/23, 8:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that we have initiated a process to put your EWYL program on hold and we are just one step away from it.
Can you please confirm whether you have sent the email on the mentioned Email ID's.

If yes, kindly share the screenshot of the sent email.
