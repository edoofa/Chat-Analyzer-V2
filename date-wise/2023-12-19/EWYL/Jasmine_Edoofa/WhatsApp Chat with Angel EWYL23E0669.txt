Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 
I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.

I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.
25/09/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 259 4230: Of course those two are my parents. They are the ones supporting me through this entire journey.
25/09/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great Angel
25/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 259 4230: I look forward to walking this journey alongside you Ms Jasmine and I consider all Edoofians extremely lucky to have councilors and mentors such as yourself. I believe I will feel more relaxed and safer in India knowing I have you people
25/09/23, 9:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That is very sweet of you Angel. I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
25/09/23, 9:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So Angel, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
25/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes I did and I can say I have the same excitement.
25/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 259 4230: My goal is to be a lawyer. It is something that has been engraved in my mind for a really long time. Its not just about cracking cases for me but it is much more than that. I like the way law is applicable in our day to day lives however I dislike the corruption in our state systems. I have observed injustices in the society and the nation at large and I want to bring a positive change. Law will give me that key to fight these atrocities. I also believe everyone must practice their right to speech freely and if I can be a voice to the voiceless then with time they too will have a voice. Also law is very prestigious and I like that. <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 9:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It's clear that you have a deep and sincere passion for pursuing a career in law, and your motivations are grounded in a strong desire for positive change and justice. All the best Angel!

Project 2
I must make a list of the youth around me that recently graduated from their senior secondary school or six months ago. We will then reach out to these youth enlightening them about Edoofa.

29/09/23, 9:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 259 4230: I have to create a Whatsapp group to reach out to a large number of students and provide them necessary information about the Edoofa program.

29/09/23, 4:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Our today's session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is on *Tuesday*. We do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday!

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.`

03/10/23, 8:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Angel*
I hope you are in great spirits. Finally, it's time to resume our session after such a long weekend. I am sure you will be as excited as I am. _*So, I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled with me for today from 8:30 am onwards.*_
Are you excited?
03/10/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes, Good morning Ms Jasmine. I am prepared for today's session
03/10/23, 8:36 am - +263 71 259 4230: And I have managed to create a LinkedIn profile via google using the link that was on the pdf you had sent me
03/10/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great Angel. Now last time we were discusisng about Project 2. Do you remember?
03/10/23, 8:39 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes I remember I am still searching for interested candidates
03/10/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, First let me complete explaining you all the projects and then we will have an elaborated discussion on how you can actually execute the project.

03/10/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am impressed with your understanding.
03/10/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  

Here is the message -
03/10/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 259 4230: Oh okay so do I have to do this with them in my inbox or on the group
03/10/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: On the group Angel
03/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 259 4230: Noted
03/10/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
03/10/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 259 4230: Okay it has been noted

03/10/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
03/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 259 4230: Following
03/10/23, 9:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
03/10/23, 9:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 259 4230: The task of the third project is to connect with headmasters of local schools in my area. I explain to them about why I joined Edoofa and what Edoofa is in general. I then have to connect the school head with Edoofa.  I can contact the school via WhatsApp or phone call. I can use the cover letter that will be shared as a starting point
03/10/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Angel.

04/10/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 259 4230: Interesting it has been noted
04/10/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
04/10/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 259 4230: 1. St Columbus's High school I do not think its connected.
2. Firstly I introduce myself then share how I got the scholarship and what I aspire to do in the future. I then give details about Edoofa and ask if I can schedule a call with the director for them.
3. Bulawayo Metropolitan Province
04/10/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
04/10/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Angel, are you here in the session?
04/10/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes I agree however its possible they may have connected because I have a friend who recently came to India she is also an Edoofian we were studying together
04/10/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes I am
04/10/23, 9:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me check
04/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 259 4230: Okay
04/10/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, it is connected. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
04/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes I agree
04/10/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
04/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 259 4230: Noted
04/10/23, 9:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
04/10/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes I am ready
04/10/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to share some exciting news and a wonderful opportunity that I believe could greatly benefit your students at [School Name].
04/10/23, 9:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I have been selected as a recipient of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, which will allow me to pursue higher education in India. This scholarship not only makes quality education accessible but also equips students with essential skills for a successful future in an increasingly competitive world. I firmly believe that your students at [School Name] should have access to similar life-changing opportunities. By offering such opportunities, we can empower them to realize their dreams and provide them with the tools they need to succeed.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
04/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 259 4230: It is noted
04/10/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will definitely help you out.
04/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 259 4230: Okay
04/10/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations. This exceptional scholarship program addresses the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education through its unique work-study model.
04/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 259 4230: Noted
04/10/23, 9:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
04/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 259 4230: That's really interesting
04/10/23, 9:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(Ph.D.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
04/10/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 259 4230: It would really be beneficial for many schools to connect with Edoofa really
04/10/23, 9:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
04/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 259 4230: Oh okay that has been noted
04/10/23, 9:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
04/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 259 4230: Alright noted
04/10/23, 9:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Angel- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
04/10/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 259 4230: Yes about community building must I wait until I get the 20 interested candidates on the group before enlightening them about Edoofa.
04/10/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 259 4230: And is it okay for me to start searching for companies for project 1
04/10/23, 9:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No, It is up to you, Angel. If you want to start the project then you can start the counseling with 5 students as well.

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

Identify one specific goal you want to achieve based on our discussions. Be sure to make it SMART. Lastly, identify one significant distraction that you are willing to remove or reduce to bolster your focus and productivity.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Wednesday i.e 15 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am*
09/11/23, 10:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.
