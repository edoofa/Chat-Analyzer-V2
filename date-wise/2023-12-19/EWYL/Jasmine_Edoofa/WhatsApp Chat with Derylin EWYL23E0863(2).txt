Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.

07/12/23, 1:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

07/12/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, The entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
07/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 111 7306: Yes l would  love that for my name  to be mentioned  by the very own founder

14/12/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: "Voilà" is a French expression that is often used in English as well. 
 In essence, it is an exclamation that conveys a sense of "there it is" or "there you have it."

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Derylin!
14/12/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 111 7306: I'm done listening to the audio
14/12/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 111 7306: Community building is there for me to develop networking and persuasion skills while utilizing social media to offer african students an opportunity to join Edoofa educational ecosystem and aquire international education. I will have to adopt a mindset of identifying and openly sharing opportunities to make a positive impact on lives of others for this to happen l have to approach  african students  that have completed their senior secondary school or those who are in their last year of senior  secondary school. After referring these students to Edoofa  l then get  scholarship  credits for every  student who enjoins the and pays the part of enjoinment fees l will get $20 worth of scholarship credit and after completing the university Admission formalities by the reffered students  l will get $30 worth of scholarship credits

15/12/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
15/12/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
15/12/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 111 7306: I have to create a watsapp group after that l have to  identify the right  students who can be a part of that group  the goal  will be to reach to large number of students and provide them with the right information about  Edoofa  before the counseling session, Firstly l have to start  with students  at my school  who have already  written  their A level .
Also l have to join their unofficial  group  and send my link with a catchy caption which will woo them once they join l have to start sharing  information  about the exciting opportunity to persue education in India  with a current  bid scholarship of 50%to 100% on tuition fee and l will  repeat  to other divisions but before  l start sending  information  to  this group  l have to add you as my Mentor  for you to  track my progress
15/12/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Derylin, I am impressed with your understanding.
15/12/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
15/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 111 7306: Noted  will do that
15/12/23, 2:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

18/12/23, 2:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
18/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 111 7306: Yes l do
18/12/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
18/12/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Now it is time to wrap up the session for today.*
