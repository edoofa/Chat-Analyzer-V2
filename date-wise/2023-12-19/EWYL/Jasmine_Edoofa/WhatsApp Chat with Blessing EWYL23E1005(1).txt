15/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 087 8756: **3.A student's journey with Edoofa Scholarship program: 
*
A student is required to submit his or her application form for the Edoofa program.This contains for instance, applicant's full name,date of birth and much more.Then they connect with Expert Career counselors for one on one Counselling sessions.For example,my career counselor was Ms Arshita and as per our discussion we concluded that B.com is the most suitable course for me.Parents  are also welcome to join the discussion.Afterwards,the student is required to clear the Eligibility Check Interview with the Edoofa Program Directors and Academic Board members.On clearing the interview,a student receives The Letter of Acceptance.There after, the student then connects with Edoofa 's Admissions team and their SOP prepared and along side they start finalising their University Admission.Furthermore, the students also work hand in hand with the EWYL Mentors to gain skills and earn scholarship credits. Students then start to prepare for travel to India (Visa assistance is provided by the Admissions team). Lastly, proud Edoofians land in India and live their Higher education dream abroad.
16/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 087 8756: 4.One of the student's testimonials: Persistence Muza is one of people who played a major role in my life,as he is the one who made me aware of Edoofa program with the WhatsApp group he created.He is the one l am to write his testimonials in detail."How were you able to earn $3000 scholarship credits" being the first question he was asked.The answer to the question was that he could  not do it without the help of EWYL Mentors ,as they guided him through every step.The  Edoofa team had to call  telling him that if by any chance he happen to face any challenges,he would have to tell them so that they help him .Also Persistence was fully committed,as he worked on EWYL projects everyday doing exactly as he was assigned.Secondly, he was asked about what exactly motivated him to work hard  and to my understanding this guy is really focused.He wants to cover up all the tution fees for the whole 3 years using his scholarship credits.Last but not least,the reaction of his parents was asked.He had to say that his parents were really happy as they were not at first aware that Edoofa could allow him to work on paying for his own education himself.
