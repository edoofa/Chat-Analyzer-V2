2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, These will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
25/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 388 1319: Understood

25/08/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

01/09/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I have received the mail.
15/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Ok maam
18/09/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In case you face any problems while viewing the video, please let me know.
18/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Right now my network is poor I am failing to download so will connect to wifi around 5 pm after work
18/09/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you understand that there is a 3:30 hours time difference. Till the time, it is 5;00 pm for you, it will be 8:30 pm in India. I hope you understand.
18/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Ok I didn't know sorry for that
18/09/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So have you gone through my video?
18/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Still downloading
18/09/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, You may watch the video once your wifi is available. Let us proceed
18/09/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are? <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 412 3231: I don't understand about the objectives
18/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Thank you
18/09/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Yvonne is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Noted
18/09/23, 3:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Understood
18/09/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Ok
19/09/23, 11:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 412 3231: Noted maam
19/09/23, 12:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
19/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Afternoon maam
19/09/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello, yesterday I was giving the team introduction. Shall I continue?
19/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 412 3231: . continue maam
19/09/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Noted maam
19/09/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Noted
19/09/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
19/09/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 412 3231: It's me the parent who is available Yvonne will be available as from 15 November after writing her exams

19/09/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Yvonne’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

20/09/23, 1:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Ok maam
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

20/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 412 3231: Clear ma'am
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Yvonne can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
