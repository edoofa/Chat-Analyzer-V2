31/08/23, 12:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
I hope you are doing well. Yes, I have removed him.
08/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

25/09/23, 12:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon!*
I hope you had a wonderful weekend and are ready to kickstart a productive week ahead! 🌞 _*I would like to remind you that we have our session scheduled for today from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.*_

I'm looking forward to our discussion and making this Monday a great start to your week. Make sure that you are on time
25/09/23, 12:47 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted.
25/09/23, 2:02 pm - +260 96 7808874: Just to try, one of them is to make sure the student is able to earn some credits for her tuition fees while learning.
25/09/23, 2:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Patience is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals. <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 2:09 pm - +260 96 7808874: I have understood fully now. Thanks.
25/09/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
25/09/23, 2:12 pm - +260 96 7808874: Well noted.
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.

Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
25/09/23, 2:16 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted.
25/09/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your eff
25/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 96 7808874: Alright.
25/09/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. Have a great day ahead!
25/09/23, 2:42 pm - +260 96 7808874: Thank you same to you.
26/09/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings, 
We are about to start our session in the next 5 minutes. 
*So are you ready?*
26/09/23, 1:31 pm - +260 96 7808874: Yes. Thank you.
26/09/23, 1:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So today I will be telling you about the Program Structure
26/09/23, 1:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Faith to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted. But how do we proceed with this program since the student herself won't be available for those sessions due to limited access to the internet? Or we are allowed to do it on her behalf before she is done with her exams on 16th November 2023
26/09/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, This structure will be followed once she is back from the exams.
26/09/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
26/09/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 96 7808874: Well noted.
26/09/23, 2:17 pm - +260 96 7808874: Very inspiring. I have benefited also.
26/09/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Patience can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
26/09/23, 2:28 pm - +260 96 7808874: We are together.
26/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Patience is available. If yes then I can have a session with her 2 times a week. 

If she is not available then I would suggest you put the program on Hold and resume when she comes back. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 2:44 pm - +260 96 7808874: She is not available for now until November 16.
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Then I am sharing the EWYL LINE number with you.
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Save this number and our sessions will be conducted on the Line only
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
26/09/23, 3:01 pm - +260 96 7808874: Noted and saved the number.
26/09/23, 3:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Patience to me stating that:

29/09/23, 2:08 pm - +260 96 7808874: Ok. So we are going ahead even in her absence?
29/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No No
29/09/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 7808874: Alright.

Today, I'd like to share some insights about *Dussehra, a festival observed in India on the 24th of October* Dussehra marks the triumph of Lord Rama, an embodiment of the deity Vishnu, over the demon king Ravana. As per the epic Ramayana, Ravana had kidnapped Lord Rama's wife, Sita. This festival signifies the victory of righteousness (Rama) over malevolence (Ravana). Allow me to describe how I personally celebrated Dussehra.

08/12/23, 8:17 am - +260 97 4960102: I am doing well. How are you?
I will be on time thank you.
08/12/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
08/12/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 2
Do you remember?
08/12/23, 8:31 am - +260 97 4960102: Yes I vividly remember
08/12/23, 8:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/12/23, 8:40 am - +260 97 4960102: Okay sure
08/12/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_
08/12/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
08/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 8:54 am - +260 97 4960102: Okay
08/12/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Patience?
08/12/23, 9:07 am - +260 97 4960102: Yes I have
08/12/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you could briefly summarize your understanding of it.
08/12/23, 9:14 am - +260 97 4960102: The first I have to do is create a group. Then identify students who want to be part of the group. 
The goal is to reach out to a large number of students.
To find the right students, I can contact my school mates in senior secondary school.
The main reason for the group is to reach out to a larger number of students using less energy.
I will be sharing the exciting opportunities to presue education in India.
By creating the group, I would have spread information to over 60 students.
Before I start interacting with the students I should add you to the group.
The purpose is to track my progress and provide guidance in learning networking skills.
I must insure that the right information is given to the students.
08/12/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am impressed with your understanding.
08/12/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
08/12/23, 9:19 am - +260 97 4960102: Thank very much. Okay got it
08/12/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. As the weekend is approaching, I would want you to take a break, relax a bit, and get all charged up for the next week. 

*Now we will meet on Monday for our next session at 8:30 am.*
Make sure you are on time and take care.

11/12/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
11/12/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were discussing Project 2
Do you remember?
11/12/23, 8:40 am - +260 97 4960102: Yes I remember
11/12/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Do you remember?
14/12/23, 8:47 am - +260 97 4960102: Yes I do
14/12/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 8:51 am - +260 97 4960102: 1. Emmanuel Adventist secondary. Yes it is connected with EDOOFA.

2. I am haven't yet come up with one.

3. Central province
14/12/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
14/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 97 4960102: Yes I do
14/12/23, 8:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
14/12/23, 8:56 am - +260 97 4960102: Okay
14/12/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
14/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 4960102: Noted.
14/12/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
14/12/23, 9:08 am - +260 97 4960102: Yes I am
14/12/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
