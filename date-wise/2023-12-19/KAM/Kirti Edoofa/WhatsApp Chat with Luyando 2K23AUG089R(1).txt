I trust you're all in good health. I'm following up on our previous conversation, as the second deadline is drawing near. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations for this and to inquire about your plans, especially considering the upcoming festival season. Could you please let me know which date you have in mind to make the payment for the second deadline?
