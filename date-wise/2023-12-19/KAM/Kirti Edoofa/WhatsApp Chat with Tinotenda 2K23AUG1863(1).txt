I must commend your family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring that you have access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
25/08/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Okay , the Edoofa scholarship program seeks to offers scholarships to pupils who cannot afford to study abroad and however I have liked the Edoofa program because I was offered good career guidance by my counselor Mr Kunal , also India has good and quality education which is well recognized world wide . The other thing that has impressed me is the EWYL program,, this program can help to minimize my tuition fees hence I will be earnings some credits which varies due to the amount of effort I would have put .

28/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes I have considered that, I learn at a boarding school and I won't be with my parents for about 2 to 3 months

28/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yeah let's start
28/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/08/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Done
28/08/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/08/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
28/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well clear and understood
28/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well noted
28/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
28/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
28/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
28/08/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
28/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes let's proceed
28/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
28/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
28/08/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes do share
28/08/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
28/08/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

28/08/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
28/08/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
28/08/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Okay let me go through them
28/08/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by today 09.00 pm?
28/08/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes I will be
28/08/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect at 09.00 pm.
28/08/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 912 7152: The first video gav me a clear insight about how the Edoofa program works and also the EWYL. It also emphasized on us learners to be teachable and open minded.
28/08/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I shall wait for your response to the other videos.
28/08/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 912 7152: The second video looks on us having a brighter future by that we have to learn to work hard and be independent. Learners have to go an extra mile so as to achieve a brighter future and be successful in life and that's what the Edoofa program wants for us learners apart from good  affordable good education
28/08/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 912 7152: In this video it is clearly shown how the Edoofa team has devoted their lives in making our lives brighter but looking for good universities to learn at . They have chosen universities that have quality education and also the EWYL program. Hence learners have to follow all the procedures so as to be an Edoofian
28/08/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 912 7152: This video looks on the SOP which has your qualifications and reason why you want to persue the course and it will be sent to multiple universities
28/08/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
28/08/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
28/08/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
28/08/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Understood
28/08/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
28/08/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Okay

29/08/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
29/08/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
29/08/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Optometry for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
29/08/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Good afternoon
29/08/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes
29/08/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
29/08/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Iam ready
29/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
29/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
29/08/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/08/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes it is not practice
29/08/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Practical
29/08/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
29/08/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
29/08/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
29/08/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes we discussed that
29/08/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
29/08/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well understood
29/08/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
29/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 912 7152: It's clear
29/08/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
29/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 912 7152: No questions
29/08/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Monday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well. <This message was edited>
29/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
29/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Monday I will be at school
29/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in response, I was attending a meeting. I reviewed your EWYL Program Pledge form and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in November 2023, considering the reasons you've provided. With this in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL Program in November as agreed upon.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
29/08/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you. We have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow at 01:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
29/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Okay noted
29/08/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day, let us reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
29/08/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Okay thank you and have a great day too
29/08/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you.
30/08/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Iam available
30/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Good afternoon
30/08/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now Before moving forward I would like to ask if you have any queries or concerns regarding the admission process?
30/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I have no questions
30/08/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
30/08/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I have not been ..
30/08/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Tinotenda, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days. <This message was edited>
30/08/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
30/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 912 7152: This is really great news
30/08/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I have understood clearly
30/08/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
30/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes tell me more
30/08/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
30/08/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I was not
30/08/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
30/08/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.
2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.
3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.
4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/08/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
30/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.
6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.
7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
30/08/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Understood
30/08/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
30/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Okay
30/08/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
30/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 912 7152: All clear
30/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/08/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well understandable
30/08/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/08/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Understandable
30/08/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/08/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/08/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/08/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted no questions
30/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/08/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Tell me about it exactly
30/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
30/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
30/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
30/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
30/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A-Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, This means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes
30/08/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
30/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes I agree
30/08/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once her results come in 2024, she will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue her bachelor's degree then.
30/08/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for 
another year. I hope you are clear about this solution? <This message was edited>
30/08/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 912 7152: clear
30/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for her exams and starting with her Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
30/08/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/08/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 912 7152: clear
30/08/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
30/08/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 912 7152: noted
30/08/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
30/08/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 912 7152: they are all clear
30/08/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well!

During the day we will be busy at work till late hours. Since your interviews are long  i suggest you post all that you may want us to respond to you and definitely you will get our acknowledgement.
06/09/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @263773909647, however, it is an important discussion and we would want your full involvement for the same, I understand that you must be busy at work, in that case, we can reschedule our discussion for today at 09.00 pm, I hope you will be available.
06/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Okay its fine
06/09/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you and your parents are available to connect with us now?
06/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Hie Tinotenda , as i mentioned before , he wont be available since he is at school and no phones are allowed there.
06/09/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes
06/09/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
06/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 390 9647: After discussing with Tino we regarded them as an advantage to us.
06/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
06/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
06/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
06/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes we are together
06/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
06/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
06/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
06/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yea
06/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
08/09/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from your side, however, you did not respond, so may I know if you are able to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Afternoon yes please go ahead am free for the coming 30 mins
08/09/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes
08/09/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 08th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 23rd of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
08/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes
08/09/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
08/09/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
08/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 08th of January, the deadline becomes the 23rd of September, 2023)

2. The second part of ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 08th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 23rd of September 2023, making the second deadline the 23rd of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
08/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes
08/09/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
08/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes
08/09/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
08/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 390 9647: 1.Standard procedure
After receiving offer letter you are given 15 days to pay registration fee $750
1. Early Registration
I get a grant of $150 and will be left with paying $600 of which you have a payment plan that is we pay $300 within 15 days and the balance will be paid within a month after the first part payment deadline.
08/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood the two processes, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
08/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
08/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *23rd September* and *23rd October*.
08/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *23rd September* and *23rd October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Tinotenda's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
08/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 390 9647: As of now we will have to discuss if we can meet the deadline i will give you our decision bu the end of the day
08/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please take your time for a discussion as a family and we shall reconnect today at 09.00 pm for an update from your end.
08/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Evening! After our discussion we noted that we may not meet the deadline for early registration therefore we prefer the standard procedure
09/09/23, 11:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
13/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

15/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I understand that network can be an issue, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/09/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 390 9647: We are fine can we meet tomorrow during the day will be available
19/09/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Tinotenda,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 01.00 P.M. I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

05/10/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence and not connecting with you, as I have been under the weather though I look forward to connecting with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 390 9647: We are fine. Was busy at work. Available now
05/10/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now. I was going through our previous discussion where you mentioned that you would be opting for the Standard procedure, may I know if you stand still on the same decision because this grant will be really helpful in order to reduce the financial burden?
05/10/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Yes we are still on that decision
05/10/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. As you might recall the Standard Admission Process requires Tinotenda's A- level result, hence if you wish to move ahead with the same and do not wish to reserve Tinotenda's university seat through the early decision and multiple benefits then we shall reconnect in November to commence Tinotenda's admission process again.
05/10/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 390 9647: Ok thank you
05/10/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

01/12/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

Yes please we can connect however our discussion with your parents was completed however, what we can work toward is your EWYL program and for that I would want you update your EWYL pledge form as our next batch for the EWYL program starts from 5th of December.
01/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
01/12/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you can update the forms by tomorrow?

02/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 912 7152: Good morning
02/12/23, 9:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Tinotenda!

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the updated form, I have taken note of it, and your EWYL program should start from the 5th of November.
02/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 912 7152: Okay thank you!
02/12/23, 9:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With regard to my conversation with your parents earlier, they wanted to start your admission process in November, since it is now December, I wish to inquire if you and your family is now ready to start with the admission process?
02/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 912 7152: We are ready
02/12/23, 10:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm pleased to hear that. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned during our conversation with your parents, they initially weren't ready to proceed with your admission process and consequently missed out on the $150 grant. However, considering the economic challenges faced in Zimbabwe, I engaged in discussions with the academic board and successfully advocated for a partial benefit. While it may not be the full $150, I was able to secure a grant of $100, which should help alleviate some of the financial pressure on your parents.
02/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
02/12/23, 10:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
02/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 912 7152: Iam very excited
02/12/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Thank you very much and I'm very happy
15/12/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I've thoroughly read the letter

15/12/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 912 7152: 1Semester tuition fee is 1800 after scholarship it's 900
2,4years
3,300 USD
4,yes and it's 750 usd
15/12/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes
15/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
15/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well understood
15/12/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Understood
15/12/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/12/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/12/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 912 7152: We are together
15/12/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Explain
15/12/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well understood
15/12/23, 6:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I live in Harare
15/12/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/12/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/12/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Thank you
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well noted and understood
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/12/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Yes do send please
15/12/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Thank you
15/12/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 912 7152: So when I have paid the registration fee when am I supposed to pay the remaining tuition fee and accomodation fee
15/12/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779127152 thank you for your concern, I have taken note of it and by the end of the discussion stay assure that your query will be answered as we move ahead with the discussion.
15/12/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/12/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
15/12/23, 7:14 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Okah
15/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/12/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I want accomodation on campus not off campus
15/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Noted
15/12/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, you can surely do that, however, may I know if you have any preferable reason to consider on-campus accommodation?
15/12/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I just want to stay on campus
15/12/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you it is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off-campus since it is cheaper compared to the on-campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off-campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.
15/12/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
15/12/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
15/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well noted then I chose of campus accomodation to cut my costs
15/12/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. You can if you want I can also help you connect with the students who are already staying off- campus because when you are at your home country it is natural for you to think that on-campus is better but over time students understand that it is the same and off- campus offers the same facility at a much cheaper price. In the end the decision is yours if you do not wish to decide now you can even decide after your arrival in India. Because Galgotias University understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 912 7152: You have clarified everything for me and I have no doubt about being an of campus student now. I prefer of campus
15/12/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that your doubts have been cleared. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/12/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/12/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Well understood
15/12/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/12/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 912 7152: I want to know that after I have paid the registration fee, the remaining tuition fee and accomodation fee will be paid when?
15/12/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263779127152 it totally depends upon you some students tend to make their deposit while they are at home, while there is always an option to pay the remaining fee after you arrive in India. I hope this answered the query you had above?
15/12/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 912 7152: Very well then , I have no more questions
15/12/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
