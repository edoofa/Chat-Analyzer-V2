Name*

Admission Group.
Benevolence 2K23JUL1905

Family background and financial preparation.
My family lives at a rural farm, so usually we depend on commercial farming . We mainly keep poultry such as pigs and chickens which support us financially.

Extracurricular activities.
N/A

Failures.
I once ventured in a small poultry project with an objective of starting an infant school with my two friends in our area. So our project was growing and we were keeping the revenue we got at one of my friends' house . We reached the time that our money was able to build one classroom  , so we sent the one who was keeping the money to buy the equipments. So unfortunately she  went with all the money and didn't return and the goal failed. This taught me that we should have banked the money in the bank than to give it to someone to keep it. The other lesson I learned is that I should not trust anyone blindly.

Work experience.
I once worked a part time job as a till operator in a supermarket. 

Publishment of any of my works.
NO

Skills.
I'm good at public speaking and provision of charity works .

Short term goals.
To attain education abroad.
To have a Bachelor's degree in Sociology.

Long term goals.
To take part in NGOs which support Children.
To open some institutions as schools which also support children.

An incident that defines my achievement.
From the story of my failure I mentioned above , we managed to continue with the project though we had  little money left . So I archieved to continue with the business and it's still running though the goals have changed.

My contribution to the society.
I'm helping my colleagues who dropped out school due to some different circumstances by giving the ideas on how to engage in projects so that they can earn a living.

Importance of education.
Helps a person to:
- get better job
- be updated to the technology
-to live a better life

31/07/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Is there such a thing as social structure that constraints individual action , or is society is nothing more than a figment of our imaginations?

There is no any other thing  that constraints individual action like the social structure .

It is the human element of social structures that  constraints individual action. People who take part in social structure  became element of the structure.

These structures can include things like families, governments and economic system's, as well as the norms, values and expectations that are associated with them. These structures can have a significant impact on individual behavior and can be thought of as constraints on individual action . People who take part in social structure become element of that structure.

The law as a social structure , guide people  in order for them to do good things. People are restricted on doing things which affects others socially or mentally.

There is also a family structure, this constraints individual action by building peoples norms and values. In a family people are taught to love each other for example giving widows and orphans food and clothes.

There is also government structure , this helps people to know about their laws and it restricts unnecessary things to happen in societies which promotes peace.
31/07/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 051 8155: 3.Please explain the relation between Sociology andEconomics.

Economics is the social science that analyzes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services while Sociology is the study of human social  relationships and institutions.

Sociology andEconomics as  social sciences have close relations. Relationship between the two is that one is taken as the branch of the other , because society is greatly influenced by economic factors , and economic process are largly determine by environment of the society .

In addition, economic factors play an important role in our social life. Most development of individual depends mostly on economic factors. Without economic conditions , the study of society is quite impossible. All the social problems are directly connected  with the economic conditions.

Many economists are more making use of the sociological systems in the study of economic problems. In undredeveloped countries economists are working with the sociologists on how they solve problems of economic.
31/07/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 051 8155: In the same way Economics is influenced by sociology. Without the social background the study of Economics is quite impossible.
31/07/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 051 8155: 4.What is the role of institutions in society -do they perform positive functions , or simply work in the interest of the power ful and against the powerless?

Institutions are a part of social order of society and they govern behavior of individuals, moral and ethics. The morality of institutions is guaranteed by the process of social evolution.

The role of family institution is to build the behavior of individual. Someone to have a good and moral behavior he or she learn it at a family level . A family institution is a back bone of good morals and ethics. It is considered a building block of society because it is the primary unity through which socialization occurs.

Formal institution like schools they teach people how to behave  to our elders , friends and other people we live with them in a society. To add more, a church institution also builds positive behavior of individuals by were it teaches people about charity works.

In religions people learn to help elder people by do laundry for them , help them to Carry heavy things , give the orphans and widows clothes , food and other things which may help them in their daily basis of life. Also a religion helps a society meet its basic needs.

Lastly, there is also a health institution this helps us to have a good health . It teaches us on how to prevent many different diseases which may harm our bodies. This helps people to live a health life.
31/07/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 051 8155: 5.Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in-groups and out-groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.

To start with, a primary group is small in size and its relationship is personal and intimate. The communication done through face to face. Primary group has a permanent duration. Its cohesion is a strong sense of loyalty. Also primary groups takes decisions according to traditions and personal feeling for example in a family, elders do things according to their traditions and beliefs on that things.

Even in a church community people worship according to their beliefs and traditions what they learnt to their churches . Its social structure is in formal for example friends .

To move on, secondary group is large in size and its relationship is impersonal. The communication is indirect, its duration is   temporary  and the cohension based on self-interest. Its structure is formal. The primary group have an important place in a simple and small society. The changing trends of morden society is that  now man depends for his needs more on secondary groups rather than in primary groups. Secondary groups are open channels of opportunity.

02/08/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I submit my SOP
02/08/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
02/08/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
02/08/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Sociology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
02/08/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Okay
02/08/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 051 8155: That's true
02/08/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
02/08/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes I'm ready with that.
02/08/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
02/08/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
02/08/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/08/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Noted
02/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes I agree with that.
02/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
02/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
02/08/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
02/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Noted.
02/08/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Noted.
02/08/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
02/08/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes he discussed about it.
02/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I understood.
02/08/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
02/08/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes it is clear.
02/08/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes, I'm following.
02/08/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
02/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I don't have any query
02/08/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
02/08/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Okay thank you
02/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

20/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, following our prior conversation, I am pleased to inform you that I'm feeling better now. I would like to inquire if you are currently ready and available to join our discussion?
20/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 051 8155: That's fine we can connect.
20/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I reviewed them
20/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Benevolence, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Noted, that's very nice.
20/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 051 8155: It's resonate with me
20/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes it's resonate with me .
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I understand it.
20/10/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/10/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I don't have any queries.
20/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes I am excited with them.
20/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
20/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Okay I will pass them.
14/11/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

15/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 051 8155: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad that you have received an offer letter from Lovely Professional University. I am sure you must be aware that Lovely Professional University is one of the affiliated universities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, with more than 400 Edoofians already pursuing their education there.
15/11/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is among the universities where we submitted your scholarship application. In our recent communication with the university, they mentioned that they are still in the process of evaluating your application, and once completed, they will provide the offer letter.
15/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given that you have received an update earlier than expected, it is a positive development. Now that you've shared your offer letter with us, I will convey this to the university officials. We will validate the details to ensure that your application aligns with the Endowment Benefits promised to you. I would like you to please forward the mail of the LPU offer letter to *academicboard@edoofa.com* and after you have forwarded please share the screenshot as well here. 

After this validation, we can discuss the contents of the offer letter further. For now, let us focus on discussing your offer letter from Galgotias University. I hope that sounds like a good approach?
15/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 051 8155: That's great then .
15/11/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. May I know if you are ready to discuss the offer letter from Galgotia's University now?
15/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I am ready to discuss it
15/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes , it clearly clarifies the structur
15/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 051 8155: That's is good for me I think we can afford the  off- campus .
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 051 8155: It clarifies it
15/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Yes, I am clear with it.. we can move on
15/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 051 8155: That means I should to pay this $750 before 28th November.
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 051 8155: You may explain.
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 051 8155: This is very clear, I understand it.
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I reside out of Harare.
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Okay
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Thank you.
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles Mukuru for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 051 8155: You can provide them in case we will use it but I prefer that one of Mr. Rajan
15/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here are the *Mukuru account details*

15/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 051 8155: Thank you very much.
15/11/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 051 8155: That is good.
15/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 051 8155: I understood it.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 051 8155: That's very true .
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics.
