1.*Visit Your School:* Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

14/12/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, please. As previously stated, the admission process needs to be finalized within a four-day timeframe for Anesu to commence the EWYL program promptly.

This is precisely why I initially asked about your preferred time for connection, to ensure we can move forward efficiently and effectively.

15/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Yes please
15/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
15/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Ok
15/12/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Thank you
15/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 795 2977: My network is a bit slow there is no electricity here my apologies
15/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
15/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Yes proceed
15/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I understand that the network can be a challenge. I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
15/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
15/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Very clear ma'am
15/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Sure clear
15/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
15/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
15/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Yes i am
15/12/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
15/12/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
15/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 870 6208: This one am clear
15/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 870 6208: So am i going to pay another registration fee despite the one i already payed 200
15/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Because was told it was for  me to reserve my seat am now lest wih 150$
15/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Aint clear on dat one
15/12/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Allow me to clear your doubts here. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, out of which $200 you have already paid, and the $500- $1000 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
15/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 795 2977: OK understood now
15/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Thank you
15/12/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
15/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Yes maam
15/12/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
15/12/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
15/12/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
15/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
15/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 795 2977: Yes
15/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Okay
15/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 870 6208: I've understood
15/12/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

15/12/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
15/12/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
15/12/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

15/12/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, I understand that the network can be a challenge, may I know if you were able to go through all the videos?
15/12/23, 6:07 pm - +263 71 870 6208: Yes
15/12/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
15/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 71 870 6208: The first video they were explaining how students got credit from Edoofa.they said there are plenty of pictures of students who won which is a sign of one of the testimonials
15/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 870 6208: The forth was explaining about statement of purpose they elaborated how useful it is.they said one have to bring a clear picture of why he /she chooses that particular school and what is the programme one wants to do .they said one must think out of the box so as to convince the ones you wrote for
15/12/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
15/12/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
15/12/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
15/12/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
