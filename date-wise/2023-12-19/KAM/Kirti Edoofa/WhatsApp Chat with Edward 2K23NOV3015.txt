This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.

11/12/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend your family, take great pride in your achievements, and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

11/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
11/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

Visit Your School: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

Provide Necessary Information: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

Printing and Signing: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

Include Authority Details: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
11/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
11/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok lemme finish up
11/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Today

11/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, now coming back to your concern above, if you can share your forms by today before our closing hours it will be a very proactive step and if not please note that It's important that all three forms and your academic documents with the Letter of recommendation should be completed and submitted by tomorrow. 

This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time. I hope we are together with this?
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok

11/12/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Considering this, for our future sessions, you have to decide on an hour’s time that suits your availability within this timeframe and share the same with us so that we can tailor our subsequent sessions to accommodate your schedule effectively.
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the next couple of days, we will have discussions on a daily basis and once we cover the first three steps of the admission cycle, we will have discussions scheduled on a need basis. Hence, can you let me know at what time you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 P.m. to 09:30 PM)?
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 01:00 pm
11/12/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, in such a case, we will schedule tomorrow’s discussion at this time. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm CAT for our next discussion.

Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
11/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes am available
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
11/12/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 303 5080: You can explain
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes they are
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
11/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 303 5080: What is the SOP
11/12/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *The Statement of Purpose (SOP)* is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok noted let’s continue
11/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/12/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 303 5080: They are very clear
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
11/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 303 5080: This fee is supposed to be paid in what time frame !?
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713035080 Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, and this query of yours will also be answered in the coming steps. I would encourage you to be patient, please.
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok so we may proceed
11/12/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yess
11/12/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
11/12/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
11/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yess
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
11/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
11/12/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding.

12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the understanding of the 4 videos.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Student must be open minded and must be reachable that’s the most essential part. Secondly  Edoofa is there  to  increase the student capacity for success finally  founders   Encourage students to follow instructions
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the remaining videos.
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 303 5080: And students should Be prompt and delligent in signing the SOP papers more so and students must be more responsible
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.
12/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Noted mam
12/12/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes. Madam we are on the same page
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:00 PM.
12/12/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

12/12/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok so this answer are need by tomorrow
12/12/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct, also could you share updates regarding the letter of recommendation?
12/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 303 5080: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes l will be able Mam
13/12/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Edward.

I trust you're in good health. Referring to our recent conversation in the personal window, I'd like to ensure the accuracy of the information discussed. If it's helpful, I'm more than willing to repost those messages here for clarity. Please let me know if that would be beneficial for you.
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
13/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the messages again here for clarity. I had an in-depth discussion with the academic board regarding the concerns you raised yesterday about frequent changes in courses. Based on this discussion, they have highlighted some concerns about your clarity on your academic and career preferences.
13/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is important for a student to choose a course that aligns with their interests and career goals. However, from the messages you shared, it appears that you might be uncertain about your academic direction. Before we proceed further with your admission journey, it's important for us to clarify this.
13/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As per our previous conversation and your discussion with your counselor, you expressed an interest in pursuing a degree in Law because of your passion for enforcing the law. Is this information accurate based on your current preferences?
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok noted  but l want change in course
13/12/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your update, Edward. I'm keen to understand the reason behind your recent decision to change your course preference. Initially, you seemed interested in pursuing Law, but now you've mentioned a desire to shift towards social work. Given that Law offers significant career opportunities in the field of social work, I'm curious about what prompted this change in your academic interests. Could you kindly provide some insight into your thought process
13/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Social work has more life opportunities and basing with my family background it’s a job tha had demand and it can make  me have better opportunities in other nations
13/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713035080 could you please elaborate more on your statement here because regarding career opportunities, Law is generally considered a more sought-after and esteemed field than Social Work. This is because individuals with a Law degree can also qualify for a license in Social Work. However, the reverse isn't true; a Social Work degree doesn't qualify someone for a Law license.
13/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 303 5080: A social work license gives me  work any where in the globe l wont have to go another year for school if l tend to work in one nation that’s unlike law if l change a country am forced to  go to school for another year and after social work it’s straight to work
13/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 303 5080: More so My researche on Zimbabwean situation today social workers are on demand and on the market it's easy to get employment than ..,. Some points
13/12/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Edward, while I can understand your perspective, I'm afraid that is not the case. The requirements for pursuing a career in your chosen field, whether it is Social Work or Law, remain the same. Edoofa, with over 15 years of experience in the education sector, is not just connected with universities, we also have associations with education ministries and industrialists in various sectors.
13/12/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We have valuable insights into what recruiters look for and how students can achieve success and that is the reason the students enroll in the Edoofa Progam. If you aim to pursue a career in Social Work, we are here to guide you on how to keep your career options open. 

However, Edward, I must say, if you feel our recommendations are not based on experience or are not in your best interest, I am a bit concerned about your perception. We are not any agents helping you with your university admissions for the course you desire, but rather we are an organization dedicated to making you employable by providing affordable and accessible quality education through the right career path.
13/12/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Should you be willing to consider our viewpoint and suggestions, I would be very pleased to engage in a discussion with you to offer further assistance. Additionally, while I hope this doesn't come across incorrectly, as your admissions officer, and in the education Industry for a long time, you as students tend to not miss out on the bigger picture, and it is my responsibility to make you aware of the same.
13/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 303 5080: I get it mam but  the degree of choice l note to see as fit is social work Mam
13/12/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Edward, I completely respect your aspiration to build a career in Social Work, and as I've assured before, I am here to support you in this endeavor. However, it's important for you to recognize that, as educators in the field of education, we have a comprehensive understanding of what might be most beneficial for your career development. This is why we're here – to assist and guide you towards the best possible path. If Social Work is truly where your interests lie, we are fully prepared to help you pursue this path. My only concern is that the approach you're currently considering might not be the most effective one for achieving your career goals in Social Work.
13/12/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If your interest lies in Social Work, you actually have a couple of options for your studies - Sociology or Law. From the perspective of the admissions team, we recommend considering a Law degree. This is because a Law qualification tends to be more highly regarded than Sociology. After completing a Law degree, you could still pursue Sociology and enter the field of Social Work, thereby keeping your career options broad and diverse.
13/12/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You might also be aware that Law is typically a 5-year course, while Sociology is usually 3 years. Have you thought about why there's this difference in duration? It suggests different depths and scopes of study in each field. While you seem clear about your career direction, the exact pathway to achieve it might still need some exploration. It's important to understand which course aligns best with your long-term career goals and offers the most opportunities.
13/12/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your admissions officer and an educator, with Edoofa having over 15 years of experience in the education sector, we aim to guide you correctly based on our expertise and understanding of the industry. I recommend taking some time, perhaps a day, to research both Law and Social Work thoroughly. This will help you make an informed decision about which course will be more beneficial for you in the long run. Remember, the final decision is yours, but we are here to provide you with the best possible guidance.
13/12/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 303 5080: I have researched well Ms kirti l don’t wants degrees in-law or sociology l want a degree in social work thank you and that’s my final say
13/12/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to see that you've taken the time to research your desired career path. However, I must inform you that the information you've gathered may not be entirely accurate. Drawing from my experience in the education sector, I've seen how students sometimes focus on immediate career goals without fully considering the long-term implications. If your interest lies in Social Work, I've already outlined a potential path for you. Additionally, it's important to note that many universities internationally have phased out Social Work as a specific degree program, opting instead to offer Sociology. This shift has been made with the understanding that a Sociology degree can directly prepare students for a career in Social Work. May I know if you were aware of the same?
13/12/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can respond to the message above by tomorrow, since it is past our available hours in that case, we will not be able to continue with our discussion which will lead to a broken discussion so let us reconnect tomorrow and start with our discussion. I hope you will be available. Have a great night ahead.
14/12/23, 3:16 am - +263 71 303 5080: Am not aware
14/12/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Edward.

14/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms jasmine  and he/she has scheduled my session for 19-12-2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Jasmine. I appreciate you sharing the session date and time with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!

14/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now coming back to our discussion from yesterday let me help you understand why many universities internationally have phased out Social Work as a specific degree program.

1. Changing Academic Focus and Resources: Universities re-evaluate their program offerings to align with their academic strengths, resources, and strategic goals and demands of the course. Social Work as a degree is phased out since the market demand for the same is low. A university finds that its strengths and resources better support a Sociology program rather than Social Work, through Sociology the student would have border career aspirations with social work included.

2. Market Demand and Employment Trends: Institutions might shift their program offerings in response to changing job market demands. If there's a perception or data indicating a higher demand for sociology professionals over social workers, a university might adjust its programs accordingly and sociology in the present time is in a high demand. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. Overlap in Disciplines: Sociology is the branch to develop a career in social work. Universities might choose to offer a more broad-based Sociology degree, which can still provide foundational knowledge relevant to social work, while also covering a wider range of topics.

4. Curriculum Focus and Flexibility: Sociology programs typically offer a broader exploration of social issues, theories, and research methods compared to Social Work. Universities shift to Sociology to offer students a wider scope of study.
14/12/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's important to note that the introduction of Sociology and discontinuation of Social Work doesn't reflect the value of one field over the other. Instead, it often represents a strategic decision by the university based on a multitude of factors, including educational goals, resource allocation, market trends, and student interests and what is right for the students to consider.

14/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome Edward, while I completely understand your interest in Physiotherapy and occupational therapy, it's important to note that your A-level subject combination focus on arts subjects may not align with the eligibility criteria for a Physiotherapy program, which typically requires a background in science subjects. This limitation is something to consider as you explore your academic options.

15/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 2.Rights and duties are two important concepts that often go hand in hand. Let's start by understanding each of them individually:

1. Rights: Rights are inherent entitlements or privileges that individuals possess by virtue of their existence as human beings, citizens, or members of a particular society. They represent the freedoms and protections that individuals possess, primarily to ensure their well-being, dignity, and autonomy. These rights are often enshrined in laws, constitutions, or international treaties. Examples of rights include the right to life, liberty, and security, freedom of speech, religion, and association, right to a fair trial, and the right to education, among others.

2. Duties: Duties, on the other hand, refer to the responsibilities and obligations individuals have towards society, the government, or their fellow citizens. These duties are often derived from rights and are necessary to maintain social order, harmony, and the functioning of a civil society. Duties can be legally binding or morally expected. They are typically outlined in laws, regulations, or social norms and may include obligations to pay taxes, serve on a jury, adhere to laws, respect the rights of others, and fulfill contractual agreements, among others.

Now, let's discuss the difference between human rights and civil rights:

1. Human Rights: Human rights are fundamental rights that are inherent to all individuals by virtue of their humanity, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, gender, or any other characteristic. Human rights are universal, indivisible, and inalie
15/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 3.A prosecutor and an attorney are both legal professionals, but they have different roles within the legal system.

1. Prosecutor: A prosecutor, also known as a prosecuting attorney, is a legal professional who represents the government in criminal cases. Their primary role is to initiate and pursue criminal prosecutions on behalf of the state or federal government. They work closely with law enforcement agencies, gather evidence, interview witnesses, and present the case before the court. Prosecutors aim to establish the guilt of the accused and secure a conviction, often by presenting evidence and arguments that support the charges brought against the defendant. They have the responsibility to uphold justice and protect the interests of the public.

2. Attorney: The term "attorney" generally refers to a legal professional who provides legal advice, counsel, and representation to individuals, organizations, or entities. Attorneys may specialize in various areas of law, such as criminal law, civil law, family law, corporate law, and more. Attorneys advocate for their clients' interests, represent them in legal proceedings, negotiate settlements, prepare legal documents, and provide guidance on legal matters. While some attorneys may serve as prosecutors, many work as defense attorneys, representing individuals accused of crimes and working to protect their rights and secure fair treatment throughout the legal process.

In summary, a prosecutor works on behalf of the government to bring criminal charges against individuals, whereas an attorney can represent individuals or ent
15/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 4The "best" branch of law, whether civil, corporate, or criminal, depends on individual preferences, skills, and career goals. Each branch has its own unique characteristics and offers different opportunities.

Civil law deals with legal disputes between individuals or organizations. It includes various areas such as contract law, property law, tort law, and family law. Civil lawyers focus on providing legal advice, negotiating settlements, and representing clients in civil litigation. Civil law can be fulfilling for those who enjoy problem-solving, advocating for clients, and dealing with a wide range of legal issues.

Corporate law, also known as business law, pertains to legal matters related to corporations and business entities. Corporate lawyers handle issues like corporate governance, mergers and acquisitions, contracts, intellectual property, and securities regulations. This field offers opportunities to work with clients ranging from small startups to multinational corporations. Corporate law can be appealing to those who are interested in business operations, negotiating complex deals, and providing strategic legal advice to companies.

Criminal law focuses on crimes committed against society. Criminal lawyers prosecute or defend individuals accused of criminal offenses. They handle cases involving theft, assault, murder, drug offenses, and other criminal acts. Criminal law offers opportunities to work in the courtroom, investigate cases, negotiate plea bargains, and protect the rights of clients. This field can be rewarding for those who are passionate about justi

I trust you are all doing well and had a productive weekend. Following up on our previous conversation, I'm reaching out to see if you are currently available to engage with us. This would allow us to proceed with our discussion as planned.
18/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes Mam
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, may I know if you have an update to share with us regarding the letter of recommendation?
18/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes l tried talking to home but he blue ticked my message
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 303 5080: How did it go your sir when talking to him !?
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, we are also trying to reach out to him, so I will keep you posted. In the meantime let us continue with our discussion where we left off on Saturday. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes mam
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes mam
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
18/12/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
18/12/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes mam
18/12/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
18/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes we are
18/12/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
18/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes yes
18/12/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
18/12/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
18/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ooki oki
18/12/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
18/12/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
18/12/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
18/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok noted
18/12/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/12/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 303 5080: No questions
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/12/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

18/12/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/12/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/12/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/12/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Ok let’s discuss
18/12/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/12/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
18/12/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Edward, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Oki noted
18/12/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yesss
18/12/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
18/12/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/12/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes. Mam
18/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 303 5080: No
18/12/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Provide more information
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/12/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/12/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/12/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/12/23, 6:25 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
18/12/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/12/23, 6:27 pm - +263 71 303 5080: No
18/12/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yess
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Noted
18/12/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/12/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Noted
18/12/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Noted
18/12/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 303 5080: No
18/12/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/12/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
18/12/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well. We will only be able to share your application with the universities when you will be able to share your letter of recommendation.
18/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 303 5080: So for now you can’t process the applications to universities!?
18/12/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since we do not have the required documents hence we can not move ahead and share your application with the universities.
18/12/23, 7:25 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Oki Mam
18/12/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can update me about the letter tomorrow and let us reconnect tomorrow have a great night ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.
18/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 303 5080: Oki fine
