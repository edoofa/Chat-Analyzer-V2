As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Paidaishe's higher education?

I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 02.30 p.m I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!

16/10/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Paidaishe.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few weeks, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges? <This message was edited>
16/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Evening Mrs Kirti 

Very sorry ma'am l thought l told Mrs Jasmine all the difficulties l have been facing
The past few weeks was very horrible , firstly l was ill for some days ,then secondly sometimes we having some power cuts of electricity in our area due to load shedding which could lead my phone battery to be low and unable to conduct a session on time

Also some other times when I'm suppose to do a session l will be in middle of a process of doing one of my EWYL projects which may compromise everything

But l promise that l will keep on trying to be right on time for the Sessions
16/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing, and I completely understand that sometimes various factors like illness, power cuts, and work commitments can affect your ability to connect and have sessions on time. Your willingness to keep trying is appreciated, and I'm here to support you in the best way possible.
16/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is important to note our operational hours, which are from *12:00 PM CAT to 04:00 PM CAT and 07.30 PM CAT to 10.30 PM CAT, Monday to Friday as per Central African Time*.

16/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 791 2387: And also l would like to change the time for the sessions ,which l think starting at 12:00pm will be okay with me

17/10/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 791 2387: Good morning ma'am
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Paidaishe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 791 2387: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Yes ma'am
17/10/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Economics) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Yes well noted
17/10/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 5:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Yes well understood
17/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Yes ,is it possible for the registration to be delayed a little bit
17/10/23, 5:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263787912387 May I know why is that you would want to delay the registration?
17/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 791 2387: I should consult my parents first
17/10/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, Indeed you should, however, I am sure they were also aware of the registration fee when we discussed it earlier in the month of May right?
17/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Yes of course
17/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: And to answer your query, yes there can be some extension given under consideration by the Academic Board if you openly discuss the concerns with us and if they consider your problem genuine.
17/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Alright ma'am thank you for understanding
17/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 791 2387: I think that's all ,if l have another question l will ask
17/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Yes😊
17/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned
17/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 78 791 2387: Okay ,have a good day
16/12/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Paidaishe,

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/12/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents on Monday at 06:00 PM CAT.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
