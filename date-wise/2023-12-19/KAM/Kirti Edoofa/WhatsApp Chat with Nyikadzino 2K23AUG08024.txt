This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
16/08/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Nyikadzino EWYL23E0551)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
17/08/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Let's us start
17/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Im done
17/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
17/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 897 6676: The two steps are clear
17/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
17/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
17/08/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I am following
17/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
17/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yes they are clear
17/08/23, 9:30 pm - +27 65 735 7586: Very clear
17/08/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
17/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yes please
17/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
17/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
17/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
17/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

17/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
17/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
17/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
17/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 897 6676: My network ismt working smoothly but I'll be done watching later on this evening
17/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 01.00 pm?
17/08/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yess ma'am
17/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night, and convey my regards to your family as well.
17/08/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Thank you
17/08/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
17/08/23, 9:47 pm - +27 65 735 7586: Goodnite
18/08/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Yes l have been able to go through the videos
18/08/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. 

That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
18/08/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Good evening I had a chance to watch the videos. In the first video I learnt that it is important for  to follow instructions, As a student I have to be open minded and teachable 
The Edoofa program  does not only strive to get students affordable education and making students employable but it also strives to increase a students capacity for success . Edoofa has invested a lot of time partnering with  good schools for Edoofians. The Statement of purposes is an important document which states personalized details of the student making it easier for universities in decision making therefore students are urged to be prompt and diligent in filling out the form
18/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
18/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
18/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
18/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263778976676  may I know if we are still connected with each other?
18/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 897 6676: We are still connected
18/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
18/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Alright
18/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Monday at 01.00 pm.
18/08/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

21/08/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know if you will be able to fill out the SOP form by today 09.00 pm?
21/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yes ma'am
21/08/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
21/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Noted
21/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Good evening
21/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I'm ready to connect
21/08/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form by now?
21/08/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 897 6676: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 897 6676: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
21/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
21/08/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Thank you
21/08/23, 10:17 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Alright
21/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Diploma in Medical Lab Technology for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
21/08/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yes ma'am that's correct
21/08/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
21/08/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I am ready
21/08/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
21/08/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
21/08/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
21/08/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I agree
21/08/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
21/08/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
21/08/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
21/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yess we had discussed the registration fee with my counselor
21/08/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
21/08/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I understand
21/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
21/08/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 897 6676: It's clear
21/08/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
21/08/23, 10:29 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I am following ma'am
21/08/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
21/08/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I don't have any questions I've gone through what you have been telling me and i understand
21/08/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright, now Nyikadzino, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
21/08/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Alright thank you Ma'am
I will inform my family immediately
21/08/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, indeed, have a great night and convey my regards to your family as well.

After the registration fee is paid i will receive a Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA
14/10/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
14/10/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 897 6676: I do not have any queries thus far
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/10/23, 10:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14/10/23, 10:01 am - +27 65 735 7586: Thank you
14/10/23, 10:01 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/10/23, 10:03 am - +27 65 735 7586: Please proceed
14/10/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/10/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/10/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Nyikadzino, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 897 6676: I understand
14/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/10/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 897 6676: The explanation is clear
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Nyikadzino,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
16/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Sorry we tired up with a funeral here
16/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Good afternoon
16/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 258 1185: So what l wanted we have already paid 350$  so does it mean that her balance is now 200$
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand. Let me help you explain. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, and the $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
16/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Can u explain this
16/10/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you understand the cost break down again. I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 258 1185: I’m not clear this amount we paid was for which registrations
16/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Was it Edoofa affliation administration fees ??
16/10/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772581185 the amount you paid was the remaining Edoofa program fee which is $350. The registration fee of $500- $750  is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Clear now
16/10/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you are ready to move ahead with the 4th Endowment benefit?
17/10/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Nyikadzino,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you yesterday, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
17/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Sorry
17/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 258 1185: We are ready to move ahead
17/10/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
17/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Yes
17/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Clear
17/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Yes
17/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Understood
17/10/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 897 6676: We don't have any queries thus far
17/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I am ready to secure my seat
17/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Thank you so much

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
16/12/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents on Monday at 06:00 PM CAT.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
16/12/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐

16/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Good day 6pm is okay
17/12/23, 9:53 am - +27 65 735 7586: Good day. My question is do we have 30 days to pay the $700 from the day of officially receiving the offer letter or we only up until 31 Dec ?
17/12/23, 9:54 am - +27 65 735 7586: Because in th e letter it goes onto say whichever comes earlier. A 30 day window would be fair for us

I hope you are doing well. I am happy to hear that you have acknowledged the message, I am looking forward to connecting with you today at 06:00 pm CAT and rest assured all your doubts regarding the letter will be addressed as we start with our discussion.

18/12/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/12/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/12/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Good evening
18/12/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Yes we managed to go through the letter
18/12/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Our question
18/12/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Good day. My question is do we have 30 days to pay the $700 from the day of officially receiving the offer letter or we only up until 31 Dec ?
18/12/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Because in th e letter it goes onto say whichever comes earlier. A 30 day window would be fair for us
18/12/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/12/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Noted
18/12/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
18/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 897 6676: 1.975 USD
2. 3 years
3. 200 USD
4. 700 USD
18/12/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yes it is clear
18/12/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
18/12/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/12/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
18/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Understood
18/12/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I understand
18/12/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
18/12/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
18/12/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
18/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Its very clear
18/12/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/12/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I understand
18/12/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 897 6676: We are together
18/12/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Yes please explain
18/12/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/12/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Noted
18/12/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/12/23, 7:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Yes Harare
18/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Noted
18/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/12/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Noted
18/12/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/12/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 258 1185: Noted
18/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
18/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/12/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 897 6676: Its clear
18/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 897 6676: I don't have any queries we may continue
18/12/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
18/12/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
18/12/23, 7:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
18/12/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

18/12/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
18/12/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
18/12/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Wednesday that is 20th December. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
18/12/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 897 6676: It sounds good thank you so much
18/12/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
