27/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 145 2450: On this first video the Edoofa founder was just encouraging us as future edoofians, saying for one to be a qualified edoofian you should be someome who is open minded, someone who goes an extra mile inorder to become a better somebody. He was also encouraging that as a person, in life you should not be someone who always blame or complain for his or failures yet others within the same environment they are able to make it, to bring food on their tables, in short he was encouraging us as future edoofians to be open minded.
27/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, I was occupied in a meeting, however, I am glad to know that your query is resolved now, I shall wait for your response to the remaining videos.

To add on, the Edoofa founder was just urging us as future edoofians, that when ever you want to make it as an Edoofian you should always follow instructions, all the procedures that you will be asked to follow with your counselors you should do as so and also he was explaining how the Edoofa program has made quality education cheap and affordable through scholarship credits and also the EWYL  program that equips a student to be someone ready to be employable and full of skills.
27/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 145 2450: This 3rd video the Edoofa founders were just showing their concern on us as students, saying they are not after our monies like other agents, but they are after quality education and this is the main reason that out of more than 3000 universities and colleges, the Edoofa team has chosen to work with only 250 and the reason behind these Colleges and Universities were found suitable and they are fully registered and approved, and they have all certificates required for them to be called a good university like the UGC approval which will enable a student's certificate or degree to be well recognized international hence this shows how much they care about us as students. Moreso every university the Edoofa team works with they also equip student with EWYL programs hence enabling student to be skillful, ability to develop their communities and stuff which is something that is great.
27/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 145 2450: For this last video, the Edoofa founders are just explaining what is required on the statement of purpose, saying that is when you should display your strength, your achievements and also your vision that may make you worthy to be offered a scholarship, I think that's all I can say, thank you.

27/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening to you too. Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. I was going through your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
27/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
27/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
27/10/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

Thermodynamics deals with the transfer of energy from one form to another and they are *4* laws of thermodynamics which are *First law of thermodynamics, second law of thermodynamics, Third law of thermodynamics and lastly Zeroth law of thermodynamics*

First law of thermodynamics states that, Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another for *example* plants convert the radiant energy of sunlight to chemical energy through photosynthesis. We eat plants and convert the chemical energy into kinetic energy while we swim, breathe, and walk.

Moreso, Second law of thermodynamics states that, the entropy of any isolated system always increases for *example* if a room is not tided or cleaned, it invariably becomes more messy and disorderly with time. When the room is cleaned, its entropy decreases, but the effort to clean has resulted in increased entropy outside the room exceeding entropy lost. *NB* *Entropy* is the measure of the number of possible arrangements the atoms in a system can have. 

Moreover, we have the Third law of thermodynamics which states that, the entropy of a system approaches constant value as the temperature approach absolute zero for *example*  with steam, the molecules within it moves freely and have high entropy and if one decreases the temperatures below 100°C, the steam get converted to water, where the molecule movement is restricted, decreasing the water entropy, and when water if further cooled below 0°C, it then convert to solid ice. In this state, the movement of molecules is further restricted and the entropy of the system reduces more, and as the temperature of ice further reduces, the movement of the molecules in them is restricted further  and the substances entropy continues decreasing. When the ice is cooled to absolute zero, ideally, the entropy should be zero. But  on reality it impossible to cool any substance to zero.

Lastly, The Zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two thermodynamics systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system separately, then they are in the thermal equilibrium with each other for *example* if we have two cups A and B, with boiling water. When a thermometer is placed in a cup , it gets warmed up by the water untill it reads 100°C. When it reads 100°C, we say that the thermometer is in equilibrium with cup A, and when we move the thermometer to cup B to read the temperature, it continues to read 100°C. The thermometer is also in equilibrium with cup B. By keeping in mind Zeroth law of thermodynamics, we can conclude that cup A and cup B are in equilibrium with order. 

The Zeroth law of thermodynamics enables us to use thermometer to compare the temperatures to compare the temperatures of any two objects that we like.
30/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 145 2450: *Question 3*
A *Valve* is a device for controlling the flow of fluids (liquids, gases etc) in a pipe or other enclosure. Control is by means of movable elements that opens, shuts, or partially obstructs an opening in a passageway. Among all types of valve we have a *Butterfly Valve* which is circular disk pivoted along one diameter, and these butterfly valves are family of quarter-tern rotational motion valves that are used in pipeline to shot-off flow. Moreso, they are used in wide variety of process media and industries especially in *water supply, collection, and distribution*, as well as *pumping stations* , and have broad range  of use cases especially in *flow isolation*.
To add on, they have a couple of their key advantages over other valves, which is their simple construction and compactness, resulting in the end  products being of lighter and lower cost and with small installation footprints and faster actualisation speeds.
30/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 145 2450: *Question 4*
*Heat treatment* is the process to control the mechanical properties of engineering materials by heating, cooling, and alloying the metal as per requirement. it deals with change in properties by alloying different elements of the metal at various temperatures.They are four types of heat treatment which consist of *Annealing, Hardening, Quenching, and Stress Relieving*

Annealing is a heat treatment process used to improve its ductility while reducing internal stress and overall hardness. This allows the material to be more easily shaped without cracking. This process is particularly used for steels, which can be too hard or brittle for forming processes. Moreso , the annealing process involves heating metal to a temperature at which the crystalline structure becomes fluid, but the metal remains in a solid form. The metal is held at this temperature, which allows for any defects in the material to repair themselves. The metal is allow to cool back to room temperature at a slow pace to produce a more ductile crystalline structure.

To add on, we have *Hardening*, this treatment is used to enhance the hardness of the metal's surface through heating and rapid cooling. The material is heated in hardening furnace to a temperature that transforms its internal structure without melting it. The metal is then held at this temperature for one hour per every inch of thickness, followed by rapid cooling. The quick cooling process establishes a harder, more stable crystalline structure.

Moreso, *Quenching* is another heat treatment. It refers to heat treatments that rely on rapid cooling of the metal to achieve the desired physical or mechanical properties. Heated materials are often cooled in oil, but can also be quenched using air,  water, and brine, depending on the material and desired qualities. Moreso, as with other heat treatment processes, the metal is heated to a point below melting  point where crystalline structure is fluid. It is held for a specific period of time, depending on the desired properties, and then quenched in one of the abovementioned media to reduce the temperatures of the material and establish the required internal structure.

Moreover, we have *Stress Relieving* as another heat treatment. This process involve heating the material above the point where the internal structure transforms and then air cooling it at a particular rate. This process allows the structure to be more stable, reducing internal stress and enhancing strength and hardness of the metal, it is particularly useful for metals that have been subject to stress-including forming processes , such as machining, straightening, and rolling.

Lastly, these heat processes are done to improve the mechanical properties of a material that include hardness, tensile strength, shock resistance, ductility, and resistance to corrosion. Moreso, they improve machinability and reduces brittleness for the relief of the internal stresses of metal introduced during hot or cold workings.
30/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 145 2450: *Question  5*

 A *Compressors* is a mechanical devise that increases the pressure of the gas by reducing it's volume and they many type of compressors such as *reciprocating compressor* and this is normally used in oil and gas industries for process that require high pressure delivery of essential gasses. Moreso we have *Ionic liquid piston compressors* which is used for pressure evaluation of hydrogen gas and in refuelling station. We also have *Rotary screw compressor* that is normally is in Manufacturing of food packaging plants and they compress air or gas and they use positive displacement through rotary movement. To add on, we have *Rolling Piston*  any another type and it is normally used in refrigeration system, contain a vane-vane slot friction pair that significantly affects its mechanical efficiency and reliability. Not forgetting *Diaphragm compressor* and they are used for compressing toxic gasses and rare such as hydrogen, and nitrogen just to mention a few.

However, we have some of the compressors that are used in *Gas Turbines* such as *Axial compressor* and works by accelerating the fluid and diffusing it so that the pressure increases. The industrial gas turbine has low pressure ratio and firing temperatures and their use is to compress the working fluid and diffusing it so that the pressure increases. We also have *Centrifugal compressor* that transfer energy from impeller blades. Many factors affect compressor and turbine engine performance, including blade dynamics, fluid dynamics, and the physical properties of gas and lastly the *Mixed flow* which is preferred for higher flow and pressure rise coefficient with moderate operating range.The main uses of these compressors in gas Turbines is to increase the pressure of the incoming air before it enters the combustor.

30/10/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form and the academic interview questions, however, question 1 is yet to be answered. That is alright, please I understand that network can be a challenge, I shall wait for your response once you have a stable network.
30/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime, I have some news to share with you. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/C4cDnwd5ULx3lGYN0nCmbd
"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Kudzi Zimunya, and my EWYL group name is Kudzi EWYL23E0850. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 03/11/2023 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
30/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
30/10/23, 11:28 pm - +263 78 145 2450: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 11:41 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Okay thank you, as  I said last week that i'm facing some electrical load shading, it has been announced that it shall last for  30 days, so I'm really asking for your patience on me because some times i might fail to respond in time due to low battery percentage, thank you.
30/10/23, 11:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. However, I would love to continue with our discussion our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 01:00 pm. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
30/10/23, 11:51 pm - +263 78 145 2450: I'm comfortable with it, have a blessed night
31/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Very interesting
31/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
31/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Crystal clear
31/10/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
31/10/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Following
31/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
31/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 145 2450: No, everything is clear, good morning
01/11/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Kudzi.

01/11/23, 11:48 am - +263 78 145 2450: I've no query
01/11/23, 11:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
01/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 145 2450: Yes, indeed I'm very excited
01/11/23, 11:54 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

15/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 618 4236: I am following
15/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 618 4236: I would like to know when will be the last day of payment. I noticed that the offer letter was dated 9 November 2023
15/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Should I start to count the days of payment from the 9th , counting 15 days
15/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263776184236 I would appreciate you being patient please, as we will be helping you understand the letter and deadlines in detail, please.
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Noted
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 618 4236: 1 My fees per semester tuition fees is USD $900. That is after the scholarship.
2. The standard duration of the course is 3years that is 6 semesters.
3. The admission and procedure fee is 
USD $300.
4. The registration fee is USD $750 <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Noted
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 618 4236: I am following
15/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 618 4236: It's loud and clear
15/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Noted
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 618 4236: It's clear
15/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 618 4236: I am getting you.
15/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Thank you for waiving the $300
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Yes. Kindly explain how it works
15/11/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Yes the option is so clear
15/11/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Thank you so much. I have understood everything. I no longer have any questions
15/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, however, since our available hours for today are over we will be reconnecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm I hope you will be available to connect with us without any delays.
16/11/23, 4:54 am - +263 77 618 4236: Yes I will be readily available
16/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kudzi.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?

16/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Yes, so far I have understood everything
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 618 4236: I reside in Harare and I  always travel to Mutare where my family are.
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 618 4236: On payment, I will be using my visa card
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Thank you for the contact
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 618 4236: In the event that I face some challenges in paying. I will contact him and pay the money to him
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible on that note, if you wish to make the payment using your Card, then, in that case, you can use either of the two methods. Transfer charges through both the modes ar 10%.

1. Using PayPal
2. By Direct Payment through Edoofa's Website (Available at www.edoofa.com)
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
16/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Thank you for the information.  I shall contact you when I will be doing the payment. Last time when I was paying to Edoofa they raised an invoice and I paid it using my visa card through PayPal
16/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please that is alright, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Thank you for the recap
16/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Yes I have understand it. It's a noble Idea
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Yes. It's so clear
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 618 4236: At the moment I do not have any questions
16/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
