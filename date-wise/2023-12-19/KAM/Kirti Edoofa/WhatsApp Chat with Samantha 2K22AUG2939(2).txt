19/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
20/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Samantha,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to Samantha's university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if you are facing any challenges, due to which you are not able to connect with us?
20/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Good afternoon  officer

20/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I'm  sorry I'm not available  now
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand you must be busy, let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am.
21/10/23, 9:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Samantha,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time? <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 440 5506: Let's connect at 12:15 afternoon
21/10/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response.
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Good afternoon  I'm now available
21/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 636 1744: I remember that it was said that I will receive a letter from the founders of edoofa every Wednesday in form of a newsletter.  I don't remember well about the statement of purpose but I do remember that it  was said that after that I will receive a counseling sessions from a mentor on university admissions, I will receive an offer letter from different universities or colleges after that I required to pay for registration in something like five universities and wait for the acceptance letter from the university . And I will use the acceptance letter to apply for a VISA
21/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 636 1744: May you please explain again on the statement of purpose
21/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
21/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 636 1744: Thank you  very much 
Understood
21/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however since it is a Saturday today and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Thank you
01/11/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Samantha,

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I was looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems you haven't had a chance to respond, even though I noticed that you've seen my previous message. Could I please inquire if our connection is still connected?

27/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the O- level results, it is noted with us, I am sorry to hear about that, may I know what happened?
27/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I had a very serious chest pain not flue not coughing but my chest was heavy  and blocking  and feeling  very weak even  the doctors couldn't  diagnose  the problem because  it was just complicated but at last they notice that I had  heart problem one of my vessels  is too weak it doesn't  pump  properly
27/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about the serious chest pain you've been experiencing and the complexity of the diagnosis. It must be challenging to deal with such health concerns. It's important to prioritize your health and follow the recommended treatments and advice from your doctor, may I know how do you feel now?
27/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I'm feeling  better
27/11/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, you are feeling better now. I would now love to continue and move ahead with our discussion however, it is past our available hours, so let us reconnect tomorrow to move ahead with our discussion.
27/11/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Thank you I will be waiting
27/11/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Have a great night.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Good afternoon officer yes I am  available
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now with this, we proceed to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes  the information is accurate
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes thank you I understand
28/11/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/11/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/11/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes he did thank you
28/11/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Well understood thank you
28/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok so in other words $750  is a once off pay ment
28/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 440 5506: So this $2800 per annum is it possible  that I break it into 3
28/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better please. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 440 5506: If you say the second installment  is to be payed in january  next year you mean 2025
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct. May I know if you are clear?
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok thank you its very clear now
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
28/11/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
28/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 440 5506: I understand  thank you
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Sorry may know what I was doing earlier  was just a training  without  credits
28/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263774405506 no please, you can enquire about your credits with your mentor and once you register yourself with the university your EWYL account gets linked with the university account, and all the credits that you have earned so far can be used then.
28/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok thank you I understand
28/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now since we will not be available since our available working hours are now over so we will continue with our discussion let us reconnect tomorrow during the daytime which is at 12:30 pm. Have a great evening ahead.
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Samantha.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 636 1744: Good day

29/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 440 5506: At the moment I don't  have a question
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

01/12/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
01/12/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
01/12/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Samantha, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 636 1744: O am following
01/12/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/12/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/12/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/12/23, 8:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Samantha

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
02/12/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 440 5506: Sorry Kirti may  we connect in the evening  im tired  up to15: 00 hrs so may we connect  at15: 30
02/12/23, 8:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand that however, since today is Saturday I will only be available till 12:30 pm.
02/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 440 5506: Ok thank you let's meet on Monday
02/12/23, 9:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let us reconnect on Monday. Have a great weekend ahead!
04/12/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and Samantha. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

With regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available now to proceed with the session so that we can continue with our discussion which we not able to discuss?
04/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Sorry officer Samantha is not able to connect  so I can't  connect  because  I think we are supposed  to be together  let's  wait for her to be available
04/12/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that, however, since we have been not able to connect for the past few days, I would encourage you to move ahead with the discussion and once Samantha is back she can go through our conversation when she is available.
04/12/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok please  lets go ahead hope  most discussion will need me  not to answer on behalf of Samantha
04/12/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear here?
04/12/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes you are clear I get you
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/12/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Oooh ok i get you
04/12/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
04/12/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
04/12/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
04/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 440 5506: No you are very clear thank you
04/12/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
04/12/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Please do provide   me with information thank you
04/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
04/12/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
04/12/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
04/12/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
04/12/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Please can you clarify  this one
04/12/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 440 5506: You said the scholarship  will be reduced but  you never  said to what percent from 50 percent  please clarify  the whole passage
04/12/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me clarify this for you: Typically, a student requires 2'E' grades to be eligible for a 50% scholarship. If someone waits until their results are out, the scholarship amount might change, right? But, if a student secures their scholarship slot with the university through the Endowment Program, their scholarship rate will stay fixed at the initial 50%, regardless of any changes in the results. This means that the student's scholarship opportunity is preserved even if they have lower academic performance in school. Additionally, if a student ends up with better results, the university will review their application again. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without assistance from Edoofa?
04/12/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok understood  thank you
04/12/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
04/12/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Ok its clear
04/12/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
04/12/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Please may you explain  option 3
04/12/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
04/12/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
04/12/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes you are  clear but I have a question  supposed  she reappear in June  2024 still will start  her university in 2025
04/12/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
04/12/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
04/12/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Understood  thank you
04/12/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
04/12/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Understood  thank you
04/12/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 440 5506: No question  thank you
04/12/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Samantha's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that samantha is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
04/12/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 440 5506: Yes sure
04/12/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. 
With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

16/12/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Samantha,
