I would like to inform you again that the admissions for the 2024 intake are now open through Edoofa, so I hope you understand the importance of the documents, as we would require them in order to share your applications with the universities, and for the national ID as I mentioned by the time it is being processed you can share the birth certificate.

17/10/23, 4:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Fidelis,

18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Fidelis.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, however, you did not respond, since we were not able to connect yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/10/23, 11:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 11:48 am - +265 998 31 73 56: Hey
19/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Fidelis.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
19/10/23, 3:41 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Good Afternoon Kirti
19/10/23, 3:43 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Please take note that we have  asked for a copy of MSCE Result slip from the School and we have not yet recieved it.
19/10/23, 3:45 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: We have applied for National ID and the ID number will be given to us by end of next week. Please take note that Fidelis does not have a Birth Certificate so this does not work for us. We surely hope that as next week ends we shall have all the required documents ready
19/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me, in that case, may I know by when are you expecting to get an from the school regarding the Msce and Jce results?
19/10/23, 3:46 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: You want both JCE and MSCE?
19/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the national Id, I completely understand and as I mentioned you can share your id for the time being, please.
19/10/23, 3:47 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Mine?
19/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please as mentioned in the inquired list of documents. I would require both MSCE AND JCE results.
19/10/23, 3:48 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Sorry; The JCE skipped my mind
19/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please if a student's ID is under process parents can share their own ID for the time being.
19/10/23, 3:48 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: WE will provide both then
19/10/23, 3:48 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: This is well noted with thanks
19/10/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, however, please note that the 2024 admissions are now open through Edoofa, so I would want you to be a little proactive so that we can share the applications with universities, and get Fidelis the best colleges.
19/10/23, 3:52 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: We will try our best
19/10/23, 3:52 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: we surely need the best school for our son
19/10/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us?
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: lets talk
19/10/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 4:08 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Thanks for reminding me
19/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.  Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 4:10 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Should it be me - Mother answering or should be Fidelis now
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The discussion is for both parents and student, if the student is not available, parents can do that on behalf of the student.
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: alright
19/10/23, 4:17 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: My understanding of the process then is as follows: First we will get the message from the Edoofa Founder then we will send our statement of purpose. When this is done we will go through some counselling on admission into the university. It is only after this that we will get offer letters from different universities. WE will then be asked to write an acceptance letter after which the Visa Application process will start
19/10/23, 4:21 pm - +265 992 71 08 82: That's our understanding indeed.

With your guidance we need to know the *timelines* for fulfilling the steps as outlined
19/10/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing you understanding, I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
19/10/23, 4:25 pm - +265 992 71 08 82: Glad we are moving forward Kirti
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 5:05 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes
19/10/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 5:10 pm - +265 992 71 08 82: Very useful information Kirti. Thanks for this.
19/10/23, 5:11 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes he did
19/10/23, 5:14 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yap she did
19/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 5:24 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes we are on the same page
19/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 5:45 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: OKY
19/10/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 6:25 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Ooh okay
19/10/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 7:08 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Ooh okay
19/10/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 7:10 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes the registration fee do you specifically need the ewyl points
19/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/10/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Fidelis,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to Fidelis's university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if you are facing any challenges, due to which you are not able to connect with us?
20/10/23, 5:51 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Very much so
20/10/23, 7:14 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 7:14 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 7:16 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Please take note we went to the school where Fidelis wrote his JCE and we were told the examination body stopped printing certificates. All they did was to give us this write up
20/10/23, 7:17 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: For MSCE results, the notification slips are also not at the school yet. But the school has their own School Management System where they uploaded th3 results
20/10/23, 7:19 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 7:20 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: I hope these suffice
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents, it is duly noted with us. However, since our working hours are going to be over soon, I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow 08:30 am.
21/10/23, 8:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Fidelis,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 10:00 am - +265 996 12 72 66: I am available
21/10/23, 10:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents, however, the JCE result will not work since it is not an official result. In that case, I would suggest you get a letter of recommendation written by the school that Fidelis has passed jce with excellent grades and the name of the subjects he had.
21/10/23, 10:11 am - +265 996 12 72 66: That means we have to go back to the school. 

But the assumption is the school made was that th stamp will suffice
21/10/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand I will have to discuss with the team if this result, would be accepted or not, if not then I have already advised you to get a letter of recommendation written by school, you can share that by Monday please.
21/10/23, 10:14 am - +265 996 12 72 66: I have my fingers crossed
21/10/23, 10:15 am - +265 996 12 72 66: If it doesn't then yes; we will have to go back to the school on Monday
21/10/23, 10:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: In the meantime let us continue with our discussion. May I know if you are available to connect?
21/10/23, 10:17 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes
21/10/23, 10:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 10:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 10:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 10:25 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Done
21/10/23, 10:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 10:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCEresults, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 10:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Fidelis, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 10:34 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Well understood with thanks
21/10/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 10:38 am - +265 996 12 72 66: I have understood it and it is remarkable
21/10/23, 10:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 10:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 10:40 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes
21/10/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/10/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/10/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/10/23, 10:45 am - +265 996 12 72 66: I have understood.

But I have a question. Is it by default that you are on this plan because you are an Edoofian?
21/10/23, 10:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand your question well, could you please elaborate so I can understand better?
21/10/23, 10:49 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Is Fidelis on this plan?
21/10/23, 10:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please this plan is specifically for 2024 students who are taking smart decisions to secure their university seat early.
21/10/23, 10:50 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Alright. Anything he needs to do?
21/10/23, 10:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: No, please. As Fidelis's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/10/23, 10:53 am - +265 996 12 72 66: For sure
21/10/23, 10:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter, however, we will share the application once we receive the letter of recommendation, the current JCE result will not be considered as an Offical document.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/10/23, 11:00 am - +265 996 12 72 66: So we wait for 3 to five days; right?
21/10/23, 11:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: After you share the letter of recommendation on Monday, you will wait for a week, 3-5 days is application evaluation time.
21/10/23, 11:06 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Alright
21/10/23, 11:06 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Thank you
21/10/23, 11:06 am - +265 996 12 72 66: Have a blessed day
21/10/23, 1:28 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: May I please have an address where the recommendation letter should be addressed to
21/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can address the letter to academic board and share the picture the of the letter here.
21/10/23, 2:03 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: What is there address?
21/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: academicboard@edoofa.com
21/10/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: I need a proper address
21/10/23, 2:14 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: The one that will be on the letter itself
21/10/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I am not able to understand you well here, the letter of recommendation is always addressed to the academic board.
21/10/23, 2:21 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes I understand. But I want the postal address
21/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you can refer to the acceptance letter, the postal address is clearly mentioned in the acceptance letter please.

30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know by when can I expect an update form you regarding the letter?

14/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Fidelis.

I hope you are doing well. I completely understand you here. This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
14/11/23, 12:29 pm - +265 992 71 08 82: We take note and remain positive.

However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
30/11/23, 10:06 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes but I was just wondering since most of my edoofian freinds know were there going so the pressure was getting into our heads

18/12/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Fidelis,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/12/23, 6:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/12/23, 6:03 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Good evening Mr Kirti. Thank you so much for being there on time
18/12/23, 6:04 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes we have read the contents of the offer letter and we will surely appreciate more details
18/12/23, 6:07 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: is there any order of our discussion?
18/12/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Yes please we do have an order. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/12/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/12/23, 6:09 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: surely yes
18/12/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: 1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
*$975*
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
*3 Years*
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
*$200*
4. What’s the Registration fee?
*$500*
18/12/23, 6:15 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: That's how we understand the letter
18/12/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
18/12/23, 6:18 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes
18/12/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
18/12/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: This is well well understood. We obviously opt for air-conditioning room
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
18/12/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
18/12/23, 6:33 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: not really clear ........may i know if the on campus accomodation you have has an air conditioner included
18/12/23, 6:34 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: ooh okay clear on this one
18/12/23, 6:51 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Are you there?
18/12/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I am here only, yes please, the rooms with air conditioner and without air conditioner are available and the price vary accordingly.
18/12/23, 6:55 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Ok so the $1675 is annual fees  without air - conditioner; right?
18/12/23, 6:56 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: this looks expensive; we can go with the cheaper one; the off cumpas ones but still with aircon
18/12/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I understand that it is expensive and that is why our students prefer off-campus, it is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off-campus since it is cheaper compared to the on- campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off- campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.
18/12/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
18/12/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
18/12/23, 7:01 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: yes and now it is very clear
18/12/23, 7:01 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: we can move on
18/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
18/12/23, 7:03 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes this is clear
18/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 ( $500 registration fee + $200 admission processing fee) within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far.
18/12/23, 7:06 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: But we have not yet receieved the official offer letter
18/12/23, 7:07 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: No email has been recieved yet from LPU yet
18/12/23, 7:23 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: are we still on?
18/12/23, 7:39 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Are you there Mr Kirti?
18/12/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, I was occupied with a work-related call. I completely understand what you are trying to say here. However, let me help you understand better. The university is our partnered university and sometimes the university gets occupied hence they share the offer letter with us to share with you, meaning the letter you have received is the official offer letter. So you do not have to worry about it.
18/12/23, 7:43 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: was just wondering if the bank can accept the letter with such a water mark
18/12/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I appreciate your need for clarity on certain aspects, and as a parent myself, I completely understand the desire for thorough understanding. I'm grateful that you took the time to carefully review the offer letter and compile your questions. It's reassuring to know that you are actively engaged in this process.

Our meeting today is primarily aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the offer letter and addressing any concerns you may have. Please be assured that all the queries you have raised will be thoroughly discussed as we proceed.
18/12/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we begin our conversation, I will guide you through the letter, ensuring all aspects are clear. Should there be any remaining questions by the end of our discussion, we will certainly address them as well. Could you please let me know if you are ready to start our discussion now?
18/12/23, 7:49 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: I understand; lets move on
18/12/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/12/23, 7:53 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes please
18/12/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/12/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/12/23, 7:56 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes
18/12/23, 7:57 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: and this is great
18/12/23, 7:59 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: One question please : are you then changing the letter we are taking to the bank the one that indicates $700
18/12/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265996127266 whenever you intend to pay you will have to inform us first and we will provide you with an invoice so that you can pay without any hurdles and show the same to the bank.
18/12/23, 8:02 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: great; Thanks
18/12/23, 8:03 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: so since we have forex problem in Malawi we would rather start the process immediately
18/12/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please I completely understand you there. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
18/12/23, 8:08 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: We do not have a foreign currency account; we also do not have a Paypal account; very unfortunate. Can't we use swift transfer as we did with the first payment?
18/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, surely you can. We were just giving you more options, please do not worry about it.
18/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
18/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/12/23, 8:11 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Yes
18/12/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/12/23, 8:13 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: We intend to start the process; please send the invoice.
18/12/23, 8:15 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: And as we indicated already; Forex is a big problem in Malawi and it is our hope that should the bank fail to process within the stipulated time period; the delay will be accomodated
18/12/23, 8:17 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: and there is a statement in the acceptance letter that starts like "I am applying without submitting my results as it is not declared yet ...." May you please clarify; do you mean the original certificate?
18/12/23, 8:19 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Lastly the offer letter indicates that Fidelis was born in 2006 but this is a mistake - he was born in 2007
18/12/23, 8:26 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: The invoice should be of the full payment of $550 please
18/12/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing all the queries and updates. I just requested the accounts team for the invoice and do not worry I will be sharing the invoice with you tomorrow, for I would require the following details:

18/12/23, 8:36 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Well understood
18/12/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Let me help you understand better, you do not have to worry about it. Fidelis's results have been shared however, what you are reading here in the offer letter is the standard statement for every student. So you do not have to worry about it please.
18/12/23, 8:42 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: This is well noted with thanks
18/12/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
18/12/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
18/12/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
