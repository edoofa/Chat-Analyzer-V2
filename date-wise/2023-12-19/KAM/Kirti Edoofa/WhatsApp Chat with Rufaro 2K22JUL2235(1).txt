05/10/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Thank you for informing me
05/10/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes the information is accurate
05/10/23, 4:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

05/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780991610 may I know by when will your mother be able to share the documents?
05/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 099 1610: At around 8pm when she is back from work
05/10/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm and continue with our discussion.
06/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Good after
06/10/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rufaro.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for submitting the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Sorry sir I was having network problems
06/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 099 1610: But I am now available
06/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I remember that I am at step 3 which is the counselling session on university admission
06/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
06/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I am not sure
06/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, I am more than happy to help you and understand the process of the admission process. May I know if you are ready?
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes I am ready
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
06/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I understand
06/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
06/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
06/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
06/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 099 1610: Yes I agree it is impossible for one to study at multiple universities
07/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/10/23, 11:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/10/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 099 1610: Thank you for sharing this information with me
07/10/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 099 1610: You are correct
07/10/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 099 1610: Yes we are on the same page
07/10/23, 12:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
07/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes I have taken note
07/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
07/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
07/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I understand
07/10/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
07/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I have a question ?
07/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 099 1610: The offer letters from universities will come after my ZIMSEC A level results come out?
09/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Good  day
09/10/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rufaro.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded, it was past our available working hours so we did not get back to you which was followed by the weekend, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rufaro,

I trust you're in good health. I was anticipating a response from you yesterday but haven't received one yet. Is there something that's been hindering you from replying, @263780991610 @263733303783 ?
13/10/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Rufaro,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you for the past few days, however, it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response @263780991610 @263733303783 ?
16/10/23, 6:32 am - +263 78 099 1610: Good morning sir!
16/10/23, 6:32 am - +263 78 099 1610: I am busy preparing for my Final examinations starting on Tuesday, tomorrow.
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 78 099 1610: We can continue sir
16/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
16/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Rufaro, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
16/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I understand
16/10/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
16/10/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/10/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes it does!
16/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
16/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes it does resonate with me
16/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
16/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I am following
16/10/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
16/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes you can inlighten me
16/10/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
16/10/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
16/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Thank you for the heads up sir
16/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
16/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes you right
16/10/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 099 1610: It's OK I understand
16/10/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
16/10/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes I am clear
16/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
16/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
16/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes I am clear
16/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
16/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780991610 may I know if we are still connected with each other?

14/11/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions.

14/11/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 099 1610: Good afternoon sir..
15/11/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Rufaro,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Thank you.. I am really happy to have received the offer letter.
15/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 099 1610: So I only got one offer letter?
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780991610 as I have mentioned before every university has its own evaluation time, for now your application is accepted by the Galgotia's university as soon as we receive update from any other university we shall update you please.
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes it works for me
15/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 099 1610: 1.900usd
2. 5years 10 semesters
3.300usd
4.750usd
15/11/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes it does
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I think I will opt for this one
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes it does
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 099 1610: I am clear with the examination fee
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes I am following
Is it OK if the payment is paid half of the payment by  November 28th
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let me help you understand better. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Yes I would like that
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 099 1610: It is clear thank you
15/11/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Can I ask a question sir
15/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please?
15/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 099 1610: When I received my acceptance letter for the Edoofa program I paid 200usd instead of 350usd does that mean I still have an outing payment which has to be paid to the Edoofa team?
15/11/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, I would have loved to continue, however, since our available hours for today are over we will be reconnecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm I hope you will be available to connect with us without any delays.
15/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 099 1610: Tomorrow I will be writing my last examination so I can't connect with you at 12.30pm but at 14.00pm
15/11/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please in that case, we can connect at 02:00 pm. All the best for your exam Rufaro.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
23/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 099 1610: We wanted to know about the flight from Zimbabwe to India and the visa process.
23/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780991610 with regard to our conversation over the personal window, may I know if you have any more queries about the same since you mentioned that I cleared everything?
23/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 099 1610: No I don't but my parent wants to be cleared
23/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you again. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and for visa is $83 and will have to be paid by the student which is a one-time investment. And we would be here to guide you throughout the visa process, regarding the documents required so that you do not face any challenges and your visa process is carried out smoothly.
