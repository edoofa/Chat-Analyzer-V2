08/09/23, 2:55 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
08/09/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am good thank you, I am available to connect. How is your day?
08/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Afternoon to you all hope to find you well yes we may resume.
08/09/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, My day is going great. I am glad to know that you are doing well. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
08/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am following, I have not yet been aware of it
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Panashe, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
08/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Surely it will lessen the burden
08/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
08/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I wish to know
08/09/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
08/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I have heard about it
08/09/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
08/09/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*

08/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Still following
08/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
08/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
08/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted , it is clear
08/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
08/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
08/09/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Listening
08/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 187 7854: That is great
08/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, now moving on to the next point.

3. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600. <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/09/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I understand
08/09/23, 4:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now moving on to the next point.

4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
08/09/23, 4:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
08/09/23, 4:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
08/09/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Have noted this, so it’s how many days maximum that one should clear the amount ?
09/09/23, 10:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/09/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 187 7854: I am very well thank you ,how are you doing? it’s okay I am now available we can connect now.
11/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Panashe.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we could not get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am good thank you,hope you had a wonderful weekend, I am available we can connect.
11/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, Indeed I had a great weekend, so may I know if you are clear here?
11/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Yes I am clear
11/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 187 7854: That’s great
11/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now coming to your query, please do not worry while we discuss everything will shared with you in detail, with that being said shall we move forward?
11/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted, we can move forward
11/09/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am not aware of it and it would be great that you provide me with the information
11/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
11/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
11/09/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
11/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted we may proceed then
11/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 187 7854: That’s right
11/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
11/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I do agree with it
11/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe Panashe will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once his results come in 2024, he will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue his bachelor's degree then.
11/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his exams, and his scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
11/09/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am following
11/09/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for his exams and starting with his Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
11/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am clear with it
11/09/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
11/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
11/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
11/09/23, 10:38 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Can you enlighten me, if I happen to have six points or less on my final A level results this means my scholarship percentage is going to be 50 %?? And the o level results and SOP would they have a say by making an increase or it’s that I start with 50% and if I attain 6 points there is  no increase in my scholarship percentage unless I aim higher above 6?
11/09/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand that for you to get a 50% scholarship, a minimum of two E- grades which is 2 points will be required, however, if you get 6 points or above it will definitely help you get a higher quantum of scholarship Panashe, it is certainly possible as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers 50% 100% scholarships. However, in order to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

Now I hope we are clear here?
11/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I have understood now we can proceed then
11/09/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. We shall reconnect tomorrow same time, Please make sure that your parents are available to connect as well.

13/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 187 7854: It seems as he is currently busy at work if possible we might go through what is needed am sure he will read and go through the chats once he is free and he will definitely have a say if there is the need for his answers
13/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 838 1077: aftrnoon to you all sorry a bit busy but now am free we can go ahead
13/09/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, Now before we move forward and have a conversation I would like to know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
13/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I don’t have queries asf now we may proceed
13/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
13/09/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
13/09/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
13/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Yes we are
13/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
13/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
13/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
13/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
13/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
13/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Let’s start the discussion
13/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 13th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 28th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
13/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
13/09/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
13/09/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
13/09/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 13th of September, the deadline becomes the 28th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 13th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 28th of September 2023, making the second deadline the 28th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
13/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted as well
13/09/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
13/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 187 7854: They are clear we may proceed
13/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
13/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 187 7854: If I happen to choose the standard approach one has 15 days to pay the registration fee and if I happen to choose the early registration I have a month time to pay and a reduced amount of 150$ being paid by Edoofa
13/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
13/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Very clear
13/09/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
13/09/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *28th September* and *28th October*.
13/09/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *28th September* and *28th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Panashe's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
13/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Thank you waiting from you now l have heard what you have said 28 Sept is the deadline or 28 Oct l need clarification there but l appreciate if its the deadline l would go for 28 October would be fine for me thank you
13/09/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263778381077 Let me help you understand, if you wish to go with the Early decision benefits, so let us assume if you get an offer letter for Panashe from the university on the 13th of September 2023, then the $150 will be given by Edoofa, and you have to pay $600 to reserve your seat with the university, and this $600 can we paid in two installments of $300, the first is required to be paid within the first 15 days after receiving the offer letter and the next $300 after a month.
13/09/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 13th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 28th of September 2023, making the second deadline the 28th of October, 2023). I hope you are clear now?

Also, the early decision benefits, for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September only.
13/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 838 1077: clear now waiting for the offer letter sorry am a bit still occupied thus why am late in response
13/09/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *28th September* and *28th October*), you can give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare Panashe's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
13/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 838 1077: oky you can go ahead
13/09/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Panashe's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *28th September* and *28th October*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
13/09/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 838 1077: yes l am
13/09/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Panashe's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Panashe's higher education well.
13/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Thank you so much well appreciated
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
13/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 838 1077: same to you be blessed have a good time, hope for good and nice University for him to further his career thank you for taking us through up to this level extend my gratitude to all those who  have made this to happen.
13/09/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. Have a great night.
13/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Thank you same to you
20/09/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
20/09/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
20/09/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Thank you Milan Singh let me go through the document l will respond soon, l hope to find you all in good health.
20/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Understood but l have a question on the 750 last time l heard from our counsellor they said we pay 600 out of 750 and 150 is covered with the scholarship and also the 600 is paid in two phrases 300 in the first month, and 300 in the next confirm that is.
20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please! Once you are done going through the Offer Letter please let me know.
20/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Good news indeed, I am thrilled with this great news and thank you so much to everyone who made it possible and yes let’s us discuss what is to be done and about the budget needed yearly that my Parents could act accordingly, and once again thank you everyone who made it possible up to now am so grateful.
20/09/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that dear. Now, stay assured that I will be helping you in getting clarity on all the queries that you have here. For now, may I know if you are done going through the offer letter?
20/09/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I have gone through it
20/09/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
20/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 187 7854: 1  900$ 
2 4years plus 6 months 
3 $300
4 $750
20/09/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a four-years-six-months-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 9 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
20/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted also
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 187 7854: We are.
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
20/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
20/09/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
20/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
20/09/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.


But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.* <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Noted with many thanks
20/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 838 1077: as a parent its good and affordable to me thank you so much
20/09/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/09/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 838 1077: yes we reside in Harare
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/09/23, 1:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 838 1077: noted with many thanks
20/09/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 838 1077: no thanks we do have it l think its fine we have alternative both of the accounts we will choose  the best l think the one for Mr Rajan is better in terms of charges l prefer to go for him
20/09/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. However, I believe it is possible that you have the old FBC Bank Details of Mr. Charles, but since he has updated his Bank details recently, let me share the same with you here again for your reference.

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Awesome l didnt know he has changed, noted with many thanks
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 838 1077: How is this payment done is it a once off payment or instalments
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to the payment of the balance fee, then once the registration fee is paid, the the balance that remains after that would be required to be paid in two parts at a gap of 6 months please. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 838 1077: understood will comply stay blessed
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Am aware of it heard my son saying so of which is a great opportunity and lessen the burden of paying fees l really appreciate this.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Noted to that am Panashe's father following the proceedings and am delighted to hear this important programmer
20/09/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 838 1077: no any questions for now as a parent l have heard all l dnt know to him seems he is still having network problem, am at work and he is also at school hope he will respond as soon he is online if hee has any, thank you
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine please. You can take your time to discuss the offer letter later with the family as well. Let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/09/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 838 1077: l have one question lets say my son scored high pointe in A level results say 14 or 15 points the scholarship will remain at 50% or it will increase thank you, sorry to take you back again.
20/09/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. As Ms. Kirti had discussed with you earlier as well, once the A-Level Results of the students are out, their scholarship percentage is then reconsidered and evaluated again and on the basis of that, they can receive a higher quantum of scholarship as well. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Thank you
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please!

Recently we had a bad phase of our lives as a family as we received bad news that is going to disturb my admission program as well as the family, what happened is that my father recently got a suspension letter from his side job which we were hoping to fund my tertiary education for the whole course and we are waiting for a hearing by the end of this month as to how the company responds to allegations being faced by not my father alone but other workers of the company face such situation, I don’t know if there is any solution to the admission process since we would be waiting for the hearing by end of this month bear with us that we can’t afford to pay the admission fee and at the end  fail to pay the remaining fee for I know his main job salary won’t be able to support my education as well as the family. I had send a message to Mr Milan Singh’s inbox that I would have a say today. Yesterday yes they went for a hearing and they are to be called by the end of the month as to know the outcome. So I don’t know if there’s anything possible that can help me in this situation that can help my dream come true. I write this text with a heart broken as to how I can resolve my future it is of my sincere apologies if i and my family have happen to waste your precious time but believe me I wanted such an amazing opportunity and them as my parents also wanted me to have such an opportunity but lucky is not on my side, I would be glad if there is an alternative way to resolve the dates and any advice as to what I can do.

16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I am sure that you must be looking for alternate options for work and to raise the finances for the family's needs, right?
16/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 838 1077: Good morning to you thank you so much but l was with another option dat if you help me with financial help maybe it will work, because right now am financially broke and l need my son to pursue his career.
16/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 838 1077: If it works in my favour that l will pay a lower amount and get the highest percent l think it will work.
16/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 838 1077: lam not in the position and very sustainable to continue because down the line as long l can't secure employment it will be very difficult then to raise the fees to mention a few.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I would like to mention that since you are facing financial challenges, in that case, what we can do here is that we can share Panashe's application with one of out other partner universiites where Panashe's cost of higher education would reduce significantly and the per annum expenses would be around $1600-1800 please. 

Now, what do you think about the same, would you be comfortable with such an arrangement in the long run?
17/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 838 1077: good afternoon to you all am most comfatable with that and even himself now l think he will feel happy if we are to progress with that so now tell me whats the way forward to that
17/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 838 1077: If l can repeat it so that l can l assure you that l have understood you, you said now am surpose to pay $1600 to 1800 per annum and still he will be at the same University which he was surpose to be is that so.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here, you are partially correct, what I have said here is that we do have other partner universities as well where the costs of education are towards the affordable end, and therefore, the costs that you would have to bear for Panashe's higher education there would be arond $1600-1800 per annum. Now, would you be comfortable with that?
17/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 838 1077: oky l understand
17/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Now l understood will hear frm him Panashes choice thank you sorry for late response l was bzzzzz
17/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 838 1077: If the same University offers the same program 8,898 088

18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: For that, I would like to mention that the program that Panashe will pursue will remain the same please. I Hope this is clear?
20/10/23, 12:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe!

20/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
20/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Very clear
20/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
21/10/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 187 7854: Yah I am clear with it
21/10/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/10/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Once you've made the payment, please share the receipt with me here. This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I’m here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
21/10/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
22/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted
22/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Greetings, hope I find you well? Will ask for assistance if needed and thank you
24/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 838 1077: congratulations for your celebration hope it will bring joy for.sure, well its fine then you have found us asleep now.thanks for letting us know. foe now its good night until we meet again  tomorrow.
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Panashe we will discuss that shortly here. For that, may I know if we can continue with our discussion here?
26/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine as well dear, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, can you please let me know if you are clear till here please?
26/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
27/10/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Yes am clear
27/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am well thank you, I hope you are okay as well
27/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 1:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 31st October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 30th November 2023.*
27/10/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 by *31st October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 187 7854: I am clear with that
27/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Noted of the 1000$, $150 is deducted and paid by Edoofa and I am supposed to pay $850 in two parts of 425$ by 30 November
27/10/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right, however, the $850 is to be paid in two equal parts of $425 by 31st October and 30th November please. I hope this is clear? <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Can’t it be 15 November and 30 November??
27/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask why is that you wish for that to be 15-30th November please?
27/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 187 7854: 15th is when civil servants get paid around here so by that time the first payment would be paid then and the other part since it would be the deadline day it would have been looked for and it would be paid then.
27/10/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your suggestion, Panashe, but it's important to note that the deadlines for payment are set by the university officials, and they have specific reasons for those dates. The university has its own administrative and financial processes that we must adhere to.
27/10/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, if you find it challenging to raise the full amount for the first part by the given deadline, we can explore options for a more flexible payment plan. This could involve breaking down the payments into smaller installments, but the important thing to remember is that the deadlines for each installment will remain as they are. I hope this is clear?
27/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Yes please do explain the flexible payment then
27/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please first help me in understanding the amount that you can manage to pay by 31st October please?
27/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 187 7854: Let me confirm that
27/10/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I am waiting for the same here.
01/11/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/11/23, 3:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand the challenging situation you're facing. Financial constraints can unexpectedly disrupt plans, and I empathize with the difficulties you're experiencing. It's crucial to note that this situation is unforeseen, and I will do my best to find a solution that might help.
01/11/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, how best do you think you would be able to move ahead with Panashe's higher education so that we can plan things accodingly?
01/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 838 1077: good afternoon to you its my humble apology and l think if yu can extend to end of November maybe things might have been bettet then and l can see what best l can do.
01/11/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: I truly understand your predicament and the challenges you're facing in arranging the funds. Unfortunately, the university's deadlines for payment are set, and it's quite difficult to extend them beyond their fixed schedule.
01/11/23, 9:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, if you can help me in understanding more about how is it that you are planning to complete the admission process and by when would you be able to do that, then we can discuss the next steps accordingly.
01/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 838 1077: Good evening to you. I was with the hope that by the end of this month l think l will be able to settle the registration fee

02/11/23, 1:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263778381077 I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discsussion here. May I know by when should we reconnect with each other here for continuing with the same?
02/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 838 1077: good afternoon sorry for late response its humble apology l think if you can give me the last day of November, l hope by then l would have done the payment.
02/11/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if you are planning to complete the registration process by 30th November, in that situation, can you please help me in understanding how would you be raising the money by then please?

02/11/23, 8:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand, however, it's crucial to have a backup plan in case the expected bonus does not come through. Are there any alternate sources or strategies you're considering to secure the necessary funds for the registration fee in case the bonus isn't awarded?
02/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 838 1077: sorry was having a challenge with zesa and was out of netwek yes am hoping that l have somewhere to have the money and very sure it will work out well lets hope everything will sail smoothly, l hope l find you well there.
03/11/23, 9:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/11/23, 9:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good to hear back from you. I completely understand the challenges that come with uncertainties and hope the situation improves soon. Moving ahead, I wanted to touch on backup plans if, for any reason, the expected funds don't materialize.

Along with that, earlier you had mentioned that you are hoping to settle the registration fee by this month end, however, without any plan in place, can you please help me in understanding more about how are you looking forward to that?
03/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 838 1077: good morning people yes  l will do as per arrangements l dnt think it will go other way but bear with me l will do it and hopefully in his name it will work as scheduled.
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Panashe!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.

I trust that you and your family are doing well today.  I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to connect with you today to share some positive updates with you.

Firstly, I am delighted to inform you that the payment you have made for the university registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team, and we have also updated the university officials accordingly in order to ensure a seamless transition in your application process. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 9:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
13/12/23, 9:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 9:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
13/12/23, 9:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
