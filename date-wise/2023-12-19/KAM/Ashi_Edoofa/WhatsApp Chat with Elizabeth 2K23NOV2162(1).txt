09/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

09/12/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263714307973, In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect on Monday at 2:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to go through the videos. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed weekend and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
09/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Thank you ma'am.
09/12/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263714307973
11/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Good morning!
Thank you for the videos, I learnt a lot from the founders of the Edoofa Program. A lot of information gave me goosebumps and excitement. From the  videos  I learnt that as an Edoofian I have to follow instructions and be open minded. The two gentlemen explained that the Edoofa Program has worked  hard for10 years in selecting good schools for the Edoofians. It is amazing that Edoofa team plays the role of parents and make sure every students has the best education and is under a school that promotes employability. I learnt  about some of the festival and cultures in India that other Edoofians experienced over the years teaching them that education and friendships strive together . Above all, I was told about the importance of the Statement of Purpose and  the Edoofa triangle ( attitude, knowledge and skills).
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elizabeth, I hope you had a good weekend. 

I am pleased to see that you have gone through the videos and have shared amazing insights with us. I would also like to add some insights regarding the videos, May I know if you are ready for the session?
11/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Am sorry am late , the network is low today due to bad weather.
11/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted.
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, I can understand that you are having challenges with network today. With this, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
11/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Yeah ma'am I understood.
11/12/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
11/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

11/12/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263714307973
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elizabeth, Wishing you a wonderful day!
12/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to your admission journey, I would like to know if you have complete the SOP form and the academic interview questions that we shared with you yesterday, Could you please share an update with us ?
12/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Good afternoon! Unfortunately am still working on it ma'am.
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263714307973, Could you please let me know by when you will be able to complete them?
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 430 7973: I think I will be done by 16:00 pm
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please make sure to complete them by 4:00pm today and we will reconnect again.
12/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Thank you
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263714307973
12/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 430 7973: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 430 7973: 2. Rights are freedoms we have that are protected by our laws, while responsibilities are duties or things that we should do. In order to be good citizens, or members of a community, we must understand our rights and responsibilities.
Civil rights are legal rights that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, sex, and other characteristics. Human rights are rights you are born with-you have them simply by being human, whether or not they have been put into the form of a law in the country where you reside.

3.A Prosecutors is responsible for prosecuting the crime that the accused are being tried for. In contrast,a attorney will do the opposite. They will work to provide enough evidence to defend their client who has been accused of criminal charges.

4. I want to be a Corporate Attorney as it handles complex legal matters, provides legal advice, and ensures the legality of commercial transactions for a company. They research and guard against legal risks, develop company policies, and represent the company in legal proceedings.Further more Corporate Law experts are in great demand due to their specialization in contract law, securities law, bankruptcy, tax law, accounting, intellectual property rights, licensing, zoning laws, etc.

5.Communication, knowledge of law practices, protocols and regulations, interpersonal skills and  ability to think critically and solve problems are just several skills I will need as an attorney.A good Corporate Attorney possesses excellent negotiation and communication skills, administrative and managerial abilities, analytical thinking, attention to detail, and a strong background in corporate law. I should also have a current license to practice law and a degree in Law. To the court, a lawyer owes honesty, respect, diligence, can- dor and punctuality. A lawyer has a duty to act in a manner consistent with the proper functioning of a fair, efficient, and humane system of justice. A lawyer must also avoid frivolous litigation and non-essential pleading in litigation.
12/12/23, 3:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. Hence, Could you please let me know if you are ready for today's session?
12/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 430 7973: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
12/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Please continue.
12/12/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263714307973, Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (15-Dec-2023).
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/FgBh65Aq1INJMCAHzZnxRZ
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Elizabeth S Mpofu, and my EWYL group name is Elizabeth EWYL23E1000. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (15-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
12/12/23, 4:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
12/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted
12/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
12/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 430 7973: It's correct.
12/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/12/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Yes ma'am am aware of that.
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263714307973. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/12/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Correct
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted
12/12/23, 5:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
12/12/23, 5:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/12/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
12/12/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
12/12/23, 6:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/12/23, 6:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/12/23, 6:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
12/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
12/12/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 907 0149: Greetings!
Everything is well noted.
12/12/23, 6:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
12/12/23, 6:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
12/12/23, 6:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
12/12/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 430 7973: This is indeed well noted!!
12/12/23, 6:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
12/12/23, 6:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
12/12/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Marvelous!! Thank you.
12/12/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
12/12/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/12/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/12/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
12/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Please continue
12/12/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
12/12/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
12/12/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
12/12/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
12/12/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/12/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/12/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/12/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted please continue
12/12/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
12/12/23, 7:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/12/23, 8:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263714307973 Have you gone through my above message?
12/12/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings dear, As I have looking forward for your response however as you have not shared your response with us. I would love to connect with you tomorrow at 2:00pm and move ahead with the discussion, as now it is past our available hours. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
13/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted thank you!
13/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Elizabeth, Wishing you a good day!

I would like to know if you are ready for the session?
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 430 7973: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 15 December 3023.
13/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 430 7973: I am fine thank you.

Yeah I am ready ma'am please continue.
13/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
13/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome, dear Let's continue with the Endowment Benefits <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I am delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts. <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Thank you
13/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted
13/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
13/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 430 7973: I would appreciate if you send more information. On that note there is a question I've been wanting to ask, you said that I need 2 A level passes right, which symbols are a pass?
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, I'll assist you regarding your query dear. Before that let me share that when a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
13/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
13/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Marvelous, this is indeed well noted ma'am.
13/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Yeah right !
13/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Well noted
13/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
13/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
13/12/23, 3:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Clear
13/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
13/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
13/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
13/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Noted
13/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 430 7973: I have non
13/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
13/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 430 7973: Definitely 💯
13/12/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.
