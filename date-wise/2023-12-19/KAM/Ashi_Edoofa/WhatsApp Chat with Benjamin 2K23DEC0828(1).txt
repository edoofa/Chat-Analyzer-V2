18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

18/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Ok I am done
18/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
18/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Yes they are

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/12/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/12/23, 3:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Yes sir
18/12/23, 3:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/12/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Ofcourse
18/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Yes

18/12/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Ok so the founders of Edoofa were giving a proper explaination about the journey at Edoofa .They have shared the issue of the EWYL program . The EWYL program is not all about reducing the University fees but also it helps a student to be more experienced and be a good employee .After a journey at Edoofa , no-one  will be left unemployed but everyone will have a job of his or her career .They have also shared about getting a job in other countries out of India .All it requires is the smartness of a student and his or her capacity to do certain activities .They've also shared about the interactions with universities before visit.I have seen that Edoofa is an Excellent Organisation as it is straight forward It helps student and their parents to gain trust and faith .At Edoofa everyone who have got a scholarship will stand a chance to experience his or her journey as long as they have not changed their minds because the Edoofians will be aiming to help the students achieve their goals .They have also shared about the statement of purpose .They have clearly stated that the statement of purpose is the key to study abroad .No-one will have a chance to study abroad if there is no statement of purpose .I am impressed that the Edoofians will help students in the preparations  of  the statement of purpose .
18/12/23, 5:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263715622820, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
18/12/23, 5:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
18/12/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
18/12/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
18/12/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
18/12/23, 5:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
18/12/23, 6:04 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Yes sir
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?
18/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 562 2820: Amm 13.00pm up to 17.00pm
