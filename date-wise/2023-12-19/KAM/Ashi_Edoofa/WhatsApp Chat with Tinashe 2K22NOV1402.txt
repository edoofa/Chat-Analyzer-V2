06/09/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Greetings Mr. Milan. It's been long since we last communicated. We have been trying to pay the $1000 today direct into the account but we have faced challenges with the Swift Code. Someone is trying to pay from Ghana and several times the Swift Code has been a challenge. Can you possibly send us the Swift Code again because tomorrow she wants to try and send the money again. Thank you
06/09/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 253 4210: The money is supposed to be sent from Ghana straight to you there because if it's sent to us in Zimbabwe and then send to you it becomes very expensive. I believe you understand what I am saying.
07/09/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 253 4210: Morning morning sir. We are doing well
07/09/23, 8:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that dear. Now, when it comes to making the payment, can you please help me in understanding more about the challenges that you are facing while making the payment?
07/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 253 4210: Ok sir let me explain. There is a lady here who understood our plight and she is working in Ghana right now. We reached an agreement with her that we are going to work in her farm until the money she is paying for our son is paid off.  She is the one who was trying all day yesterday to pay the full amount from her bank but the problem was with the Swift Code which was being said was not correct. The transaction kept being rejected because of the Swift Code. Now I don't know if you can can help us because that is the cheapest way instead of sending money to Zimbabwe and then to you it becomes very expensive.
07/09/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 253 4210: I don't know if you can help us with the correct Swift Code.
07/09/23, 9:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that, however, while making an international Bank Transfer, you can make the payment on the following Bank Details mentioned on the offer letter please.
07/09/23, 9:01 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 9:01 am - Milan Edoofa: *For these details the SWIFT Code is: AXISINBB207*
07/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 253 4210: Thank you so much Sir. Let me forward it to her now.
07/09/23, 9:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, do that and once the payment is done, please let me know of that by sharing the receipt of the same with me here.
07/09/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 253 4210: I will do that sir.
07/09/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 253 4210: Mr. Milan sorry for troubling you. The lady has just sent a message to me saying that the Swift Code is not corresponding with the town. Her account is monitored every time she makes transactions, they are very strict because of issues of money laundering. She said don't you have another alternative or she can sent direct to the University.
07/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, I understand that in that case, can you please check with her if she would be able to make the payment through Mama Money?
07/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 253 4210: Thank you sir let me tell her.
07/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 253 4210: She cannot sent. She said is it ok to send direct to the University so that her bank will not suspect money laundering.
07/09/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case Tinashe, the payment has to be made directly to these bank details mentioned here dear.
07/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 253 4210: Okay sir let me see if she will not agree to send it to us here and we give it to Mr. Rajan
07/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 253 4210: Sorry sir I am troubling because I don't want to miss this opportunity. She has just realized a mistake she was making.  She had put the University name instead of Anhad. She said could you provide her with your email address because it will be included on the full details to provide to her bank.
07/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 253 4210: The reason she is saying she needs these details it's because when she send them to the bank because they need them. Let me send you an audio message she send us
07/09/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 253 4210: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 11:46 am - Milan Edoofa: In that case, shall I get an invoice generated for you in order for her to make the payment please?
07/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 253 4210: Yes sir it will be fine
07/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Or you can send your email address so that she include it when she send the details to the bank.
07/09/23, 12:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, let me arrange the invoice please.

For now, can you please let me know if you have gone through the offer letter from LPU by now so that we can move ahead to discuss that and complete the next steps in your admission process.
19/09/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 253 4210: Good morning sir. Indeed we are doing well
19/09/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 253 4210: Yes I did. So basically you are applying to a different university
19/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 253 4210: The payment which was made will be available today as per the Bank proof of payment. Can you kindly check again with the Accounts Team. I will be communicating with the lady who made the deposit.

19/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Thank you sir
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Tinashe, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter from LPU by now?
19/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Yes sir
19/09/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 253 4210: 1. Semester tution fee after the scholarship is $1225
2.  The standard duration is 5 years.
3.  Admission Processing Fee is $200
4.  Registration fee is $700
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1225*2 = $2450
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $4325.
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1225*2 = $2450
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $3650.
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Compared to the on-campus accommodation, if you prefer more affordable housing and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
19/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 253 4210: I would prefer to start by staying at the campus since I will be new in India
19/09/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure that you be completely fine dear, you will be free to choose as per your preference. Moving ahead, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/09/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

19/09/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 253 4210: I am having network challenges to download the pics you send us
19/09/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, take your time to download them.
19/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Thank you
20/09/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 253 4210: Good morning Mr. Milan. We managed to watch the videos you send. It's very encouraging to note especially the testimony of the Edoofian who has challenges like ours
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tinashe!
20/09/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. Now, were you able to have a conversation about the offer letter from LPU with your family?
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Good afternoon sir.
20/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Yes we had a conversation about the offer letter
20/09/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that. What were their reaction to the letter and what were their thoughts on LPU?
20/09/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 253 4210: We are happy as a family but our concern is on the percentage of the scholarship. Previously you said you had considered us to get 90% but we were surprised to see you offering us 50%. Maybe you can explain to us so that we can understand better.
20/09/23, 4:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Since your application was shared with our multiple partner universities, LPU chose to offer you a 50% scholarship and MVN offered you a 90% scholarship. I hope this is clear?
20/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 253 4210: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 253 4210: This message was deleted
20/09/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Yes it's clear but I still have a question
20/09/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Great! Now, That's wonderful to hear that you're eager to have a discussion. Before we proceed with that, I would like to know if you are aware that the founders of Edoofa recently attended a global summit in Zimbabwe to commemorate our 14th Anniversary.
20/09/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Thank you. Yes we managed to attend the summit. It was worthwhile, the founders managed to give us All information regarding Edoofa.
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: That is alright please, let me tell you about the event. The summit was an overwhelming success, attracting over 2000 enthusiastic attendees, including students, parents, teachers, headmasters, and aspiring Edoofians. The atmosphere buzzed with excitement, and the feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing the triumph of the occasion.
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: During the event, the founders engaged in discussions about a range of higher education prospects. Notably, the attending students were granted an exclusive opportunity to secure a 100% scholarship covering both tuition fees and accommodation expenses along with offering Grants to the students who completed their admission process as well as performed exceptionally well in their EWYL Program. I will share the snippets of the event as well with you once we are done with our discussion here, I hope that is fine with you?
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Yes it's fine
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Now, as you are aware that with the Edoofa Scholarship, we bring this cost down from $6000-8000 to $2000-3000 per annum. But, even then, for the parents who face financial challenges, this cost becomes an issue for them.
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: In order to help the parents with this situation, we are offering a higher quantum (90-100%) scholarship for meritorious and deserving students on tuition as well as on the accommodation fee to our students, which results in a drastic reduction in the overall cost of education.
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: With this arrangement, the financial burden is greatly alleviated for students and their parents. Instead of shouldering the entire tuition and accommodation fees, which can be quite expensive, the parents will only need to cover basic university expenses such as ERP fees, exam fees, library fees, sports & IT fees, and similar expenses. I hope you are following.
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Now, since this opportunity is an exclusive and highly sought-after scholarship opportunity, the seats for the same are limited to only 500 students. And after reviewing your application carefully, we strongly believe that you are an ideal candidate for this prestigious opportunity. Do you want us to recommend your name for the same so that you can get the benefits?
20/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 253 4210: From the above conversation we had last time before you offered Tinashe the MNU scholarship, this is what you promised. Now from this conversation as a family we were just wondering if the team was not misled by the payment of $1000,  which we made. It's not that we have a lot of money but us as parents, we are going to be working on the farm of the lady until the money is paid back in full. Now here farm wages are very low it will take time to pay back the money. We are still negotiating with her to pay for the ticket and as  parents will have to work for her for the next 2½ to 3 years paying back the money. Yes it will be good that Tinashe will be at school but it will be a big burden to us as parents. We kindly ask you Mr. Milan to persuade them to increase the percentage. We really appreciate your help. Thank you
21/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 253 4210: Good morning Mr. Milan. How are you today? We are very well this, it's very hot though.
21/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinashe!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: I am doing fine as well please, thank you for asking. Moving ahead, I was able to go through the message that I had shared here, and I understand where you are coming from.

However, on that note, I would like to mention that when Tinashe had enrolled to the Edoofa Program, I believe you would recall that it was informed about us sharing your application with multiple universities and arranging multiple offer letters for you right?
21/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 253 4210: We are very well
21/09/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 253 4210: Yes you mentioned that.
21/09/23, 11:12 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, the offer letter that you have received from LPU to make sure that you have a choice to make. Now, out of that, it is your decision whether you wish for Tinashe to go to MVN or LPU please. I hope this is clear, right?
21/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 253 4210: Yes it is clear.

04/10/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 253 4210: You are welcome sir

09/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Good morning Mr. Milan. Our son travelled and he is going to pass by the Passport Office tomorrow. We are just praying that he will get it. It has taken long I don't know why
09/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 253 4210: I will update you tomorrow mid-day
09/10/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing an update with us @263772534210. Please allow me to correct you, I am Ms. Ashi, Admission Officer at Edoofa who will be assisting you during your Visa Journey. 

I can understand that the passport is taking a bit long but it's totally understandable. Although, I am glad to know that Tinashe is visiting the passport office tomorrow to take an update regarding his passport. Kindly make sure to share an update with us tomorrow.
09/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Thank you very much Ms. Ashi. We will definitely update you as soon as we get feedback regarding his passport.

He called and said he is going to board another bus tomorrow. The challenge is that there is only one bus and if you miss it you have to wait for the following day.
10/10/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinashe, Wishing you a Wonderful day!

Thank you for sharing an update with us, We highly appreciate your efforts. I can understand that there's no one bus to board in order to reach the passport office, no worries I hope Tinashe will catch the bus tomorrow and will reach the destination.
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 253 4210: Yes I have explained to him the urgency of the matter. The challenge of most of our rural roads are not tarred and bus operators are reluctant to put their buses on these dust roads because they are very bad. I pray tomorrow he will not miss the bus.
10/10/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you understand the urgency of the document. I am sure that he will catch the bus tomorrow. Let's hope for the best.
