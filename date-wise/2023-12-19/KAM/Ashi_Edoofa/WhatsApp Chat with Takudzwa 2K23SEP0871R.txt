All of our sessions will be held in the same time span, and hence, we kindly request that you plan your availability to align with these time slots.

We have thoughtfully scheduled our discussion sessions within these time frames to ensure engaging and productive conversations. May I assume that you have taken note of our designated discussion hours?
26/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes I have
26/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Since this is your admissions group, I believe you must have added your parents to the group. This will help them become familiar with the admission process and enable them to participate when required. Could you please confirm if they have already been added to the group, if yes then could you please share your parents' good names, the numbers they would be using and how should I address them?
26/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Sorry I need to clarify that this is Takudzwa's mother. Takudzwa is still at school and unfortunately they are not allowed to use phones. She will be home on the 18th of October when she would have competed her examinations.
26/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Sorry 18 November
26/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. It's a pleasure to connect with you today and it is good to know that she's currently focused on her studies. We appreciate the update regarding her return home, which is on the 18th of November after completing her examinations. 

However, Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself, and your name, also share details about Takudzwa, your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping Takudzwa's educational plans?
26/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Well, I'm Mrs Junior Zimunya, mother to Takudzwa Zimunya. She is my first born out of 4 children. Myself and her father are teachers. 
Takudzwa did her Ordinary level at Hartzell high school (where Mr Shorwi Kawadza was the school head) that was in 2021. At Hartzell high school she was also a school prefect. After passing her Ordinary level she then went to Makumbe high where she is right now doing her A level. Again at Makumbe she is a senior prefect.
Takudzwa is a very obedient child and I guess that is why she has always been chosen to be a prefect. 
Her best sporting is netball and she is an excellent player. 

Myself and her father are going to play the role of shaping Takudzwa's educational plans. 
I hope I have managed to properly answer the question
26/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing more about your family and your daughter, Takudzwa. It's wonderful to learn about her academic achievements and her involvement as a school prefect both at Hartzell High School and now at Makumbe High School. Her dedication and obedience have certainly contributed to her being chosen for such important roles.

It's clear that both you and her father are actively involved in guiding her educational journey, and that's commendable. With her interest in netball and your support, Takudzwa is well on her way to a bright future.

However, I couldn't help but notice that Takudzwa's father is not added to the group, so could you please let me know if you want to add him to the group?
26/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 512 7660: You could add him yes. Its just that he is usually very tied up and may fail to concentrate with the discussions. However, I feel that if you add him he may be able to chip in between our discussions here and there
26/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 512 7660: 0773576471 is his number
26/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, I have granted you the admin, please go ahead and add Takudzwa's father to the group.
26/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Thank you
26/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
26/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Very well noted
26/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
26/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Tuesday (3rd October) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
26/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
26/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes we can move forward.
26/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
26/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *Takudzwa 2K23SEP0871R*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
26/09/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Takudzwa EWYL23E0688*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
26/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Very clear. Thank you
26/09/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in her achievements and be dedicated to ensuring her access to the finest opportunities to launch her career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
26/09/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 512 7660: First I wish to complement him for the sessions I had with him which were very educative. I was first of all happy to know about the many students across the continent who  are enrolled at your universities. I got a chance to actually speak with one of Takudzwa's former school mates from Hartzell who is already enrolled at one of your institutions. 
I particularly liked the EWYL program which to me was something new because I have never heard of such opportunities here in Zimbabwe and l really liked it. 
Besides that, I also liked what he explained that your universities are recognised internationally and so I liked the idea of my daughter being enrolled at such universities. 
In addition, the fact that he explained that there is quite a good number of Zimbabweans enrolled now in India gave me peace of mind knowing that my daughter will not be lonely after all.
Last but not least, I was very much impressed with the time he took witn me, explaining all the nitty-gritties which to mean was and still is a sign that your institutions really do value children's life and welfare
26/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience! I have known Mr. Shubham for a long time and she always ensures that each and every student of hers gets personalized attention so that she can ensure their academic career is on track and I am glad to know that the EWYL program was able to grab your attention I must say you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
26/09/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

27/09/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/09/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Sure, we may begin
27/09/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Ha gone through the image. You may proceed
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Very clear
27/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/09/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes, following
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 512 7660: When am I expected to pay this fee??
27/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 512 7660: I'm a bit worried because at the moment I haven't yet finished paying the $350 enrolment fee
27/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775127660 I understand your concern here as a parent however, please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
28/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
28/09/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Good afternoon. I'm sorry I was not able to go through the videos. Mynetwork is very weak.
28/09/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that the network can be a challenge, and I appreciate you letting me know honestly. In that case, do you want me to share the audio versions of the videos?
28/09/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes its ok
28/09/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the Audio now.

28/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Once you are done going though all the audio please do share your understanding of the 4 videos.
28/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Ok
29/09/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 512 7660: Good morning. I have finished listening to the audios.
29/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 512 7660: From the videos, I have understood quite a number of issues mentioned.
That Edoofa does not just look at admission of students but they consider quality of education by making sure that the schools where Edoofians are enrolled are good enough. They consider things such as the language used (in this case English), availability of good infrastructure, how qualified is the teaching staff, accommodation. Edoofa even goes as far as checking if the students are happy. As such they act as parents who make sure that their children are enrolled in good school. Therefore, we shouldn't worry about the school chosen for our children because Edoofa takes care of that. 
Edoofa also sees to it that students have the right knowledge, attitude and skills as this will impact on the learner's career. 
Edoofa makes education affordable thereby giving equal opportunities to people regardless of them being rich or poor. 
However, for students to be able to make if into the program, follow instructions, follow  protocol and be actively involved in the counselling sessions. THIS IS MANDATORY. 
For stage 5 Edoofa will then schedule interactive sessions with the schools. One of the most important requirements is the statement of purpose. Here the student needs to convince the school that he/she is the right candidate and that you have the ability, display their skills, express why they have chosen the course they would have chosen and most importantly, be sincere.
29/09/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
29/09/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/09/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Taken. Thank you.
29/09/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
29/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes we are
29/09/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
29/09/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 1:30 PM.
29/09/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

29/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
29/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

*2. O-Level Results*

29/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Noted. Thank you
29/09/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Can I anticipate that you will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by Monday 01:30 pm?
29/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Definitely. Yes
29/09/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright have a great day and weekend ahead.
29/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Same to you. Thank you
29/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Good afternoon once again. Can I please ask a question? 

Since I explained that Takudzwa isn't here at the moment ( she is at school) is it ok I answer the questions on her behalf ?
29/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I understand it completely, and for this step, we would require Takudzwa's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
29/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Noted. Thank you
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

03/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was *Gandhi Jayanti*. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on *October 2nd* to commemorate the birthday of *Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi*, commonly known as *Mahatma Gandhi*. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes. <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form, the academic documents, and question 1 of the academic interview questions, it is duly noted with us, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of Entry for A- level and the remaining academic interview questions since the document shared contains only one questions which is not marked as to which questions number is being answered?
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Good afternoon and apology accepted. I'm sorry I think I didn't really understand the requirements. I thought the instructions were that questions 2-5 were to be answered in 150-200 words. Could you kindly kindly elaborate on this so that I do the correct thing
03/10/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you understand questions 2-5 have to answered individually with the word limit of each answer being 150-200 words.
03/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Oh. I see. Forgive me. Could you kindly give me time to re-do the questions.?
03/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Let me connect with Takudzwa and ask her to send her statement of entry. I'm sure I should have it by tomorrow
03/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775127660 that is alright please, in that case, can I anticipate that Takudzwa will be able to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 pm?
03/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 512 7660: I'm sure she should be able to do that
03/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Tomorrow then. Good day
04/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 512 7660: Good morning. My sincere apologies. Takudzwa has a very tight schedule at school since she is now left with just a few days to write her final exams. So she was unable to complete her task and is asking if its ok for her to finish later on today?  Sorry for the inconvenience.
05/10/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 512 7660: This message was deleted
05/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 512 7660: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Takudzwa.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 357 6471: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 357 6471: Yes. I'm available
05/10/23, 11:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
05/10/23, 11:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/10/23, 11:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe she wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Science in Agriculture for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 357 6471: Yes that is correct
05/10/23, 12:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
05/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 357 6471: Yes. I'm ready
05/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes. Sure. I agree
05/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes they did explain that
05/10/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes we are
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes I have
05/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Am I correct to conclude that this is just an example?
05/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, as mentioned above in the message let us consider an Example.

I hope we are clear now?
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Noted
05/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
05/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Noted. I hope the university will also consider the fact I still have enrolment fee of $150 to be paid by the 30th of October?
05/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775127660 I understand, however, the enrollment fee and the registration fee are two different fees. The $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter and as we move ahead you will understand even better. 

I hope you are clear now?
05/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Clear
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Clear and understood
05/10/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 512 7660: No queries
05/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
05/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Looking foward to it
05/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, even I am looking forward to meeting Takudzwa and With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

05/10/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes I have. I'm sorry for the late response. I had to attend an emergency. My child got injured at school and had to rush her to hospital. My sincere apologies.
05/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm really sorry to hear about your child's injury, and I completely understand why you had to attend to that emergency. Your child's well-being is, of course, your top priority, and it's entirely understandable that you need to take immediate action.

Please don't worry about the late response; family emergencies always come first. I hope your child is receiving the necessary care and will recover soon. Do let me know whenever you are comfortable to proceed with the discussion, please.
05/10/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 512 7660: If you don't mind we can proceed. She has been given medication.
05/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you do not mind me asking. May I know what happened to her?
05/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 77 512 7660: She fell down and hit her knee against a rock
05/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm really sorry to hear that your child fell and injured her knee by hitting it against a rock. That can be quite painful and concerning. I would suggest you keep her comfortable and make sure she doesn't put any unnecessary strain on the injured knee.
05/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Sure. Thank you for the concern.
05/10/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Yes please I do not mind moving ahead, if you are available to move ahead with the discussion?
05/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes I'm available. You may go ahead
05/10/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @263775127660 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Waaaaaal I'm pleased to learn this.
05/10/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 512 7660: It does, a lot. I'm more than happy to hear this.
05/10/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes yes. It surely does.
05/10/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 512 7660: I'm following and no I don't have any questions
05/10/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Please do provide me with more information pertaining to that
05/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Very clear. Thank you
05/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes
05/10/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775127660 I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 512 7660: With Edoofa yes yes that is correct
05/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Very clear
05/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes. Its clear
05/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 512 7660: I see
05/10/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 512 7660: I'm quite contented with your explanations and have no further questions
05/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Takudzwa's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Takudzwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 512 7660: I cannot begin to explain how excited we all are as Takudzwa's family and Takudzwa is equally excited as well.
05/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Noted. Good day to you too
05/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
11/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 512 7660: Good morning.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive.

14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwa!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias Univeristy by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Good afternoon. Sorry for the late response and yes I am available
14/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes I have been able to go through the offer letter
14/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Unfortunately I seem to be having network challenges
14/10/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. Now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
14/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 512 7660: 1) $900
2) 4 years 
3) $300 us but is waived off under early registration 
4) $750 us
14/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 512 7660: 1) $900
2) 4 years
3) $300 us but is waived off under early registration 
4) $750 us
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across four years. This academic journey is divided into 8 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Its ok. Hope you are feeling better now
15/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Very clear
15/10/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 9:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 512 7660: That sounds great
15/10/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes. So far so good
15/10/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Its very clear and yes you can move forward
15/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
15/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes yes were good
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes we are on the same page
15/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 512 7660: I'm sorry we do not have power and my phone battery is running low. Could you kindly allow me to disengage and we continue tomorrow. Hopefully I would have charged my phone
15/10/23, 10:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, we will then reconnect with each other tomorrow to continue with the conversation. Good Night! 🌜
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now?
16/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 512 7660: Good morning
16/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 512 7660: Yes you can go ahead
16/10/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 512 7660: No. In Mutare
16/10/23, 2:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
16/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes please. I think I would prefer that
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Noted. Thank you
16/10/23, 4:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
16/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Quite affordable !! I'm so excited
17/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Takudzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that as well please. Moving ahead, Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/10/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Very clear and pleasing news
17/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
17/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Yes. I see
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities please. 

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
18/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. May I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
18/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 512 7660: Waiting for this message
18/10/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
18/10/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

23/10/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. How did the conversation go and what were your family's thoughts on the offer letter?

One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity.
