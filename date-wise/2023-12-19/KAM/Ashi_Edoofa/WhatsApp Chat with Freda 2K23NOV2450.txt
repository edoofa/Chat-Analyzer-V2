07/12/23, 12:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: We are fine thank you.
How are you?
07/12/23, 12:38 pm - +265 999 95 13 02: We're okay, that side?
07/12/23, 12:41 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Pretty good
07/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Noted Freda, Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well. My name is Freda Mbozi. I was born on the third of April 2002. I am 21 years of age. I was born in a family of 3. However we have lived as an extended family of 8 for almost all my life. My father being the first born of his family, he is also is responsible for looking after his other 3 brothers hence totaling to 8 when I include my mother, older brother and little sister. As I was clocking towards 2014. I was lucky enough to be selected to a government school known as Chichiri Secondary School where I did my secondary school (high school) education and was able to complete in 2018. 2019 through the help of my family and other well wishers I started my Bachelor’s Degree program in Business Administration- Management at Malawi Adventist University though the fees gathered was only able to carter for two years. In my Second year I was able to find a part time job where I worked at Lagra Centre Branch as an Administrative assistant from Fridays to Sundays giving me a chance to attend classes during weekdays. Knowing the financial situation we had I would exceed the normal credit hours or courses I was required to take with three 4 extra courses of the upcoming semester on conditions that I do not fail even one course by our academic advisor and head of department which I fulfilled finishing in my 7th semester and not my 8th. I finished in august 2022 but my graduation occurred in July 2023.

The sponsor or rather guardians has been my father but my brother comes in here and there.
07/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey with me. It's evident that you've faced various challenges throughout your academic path, yet your determination and hard work shine through. Congratulations on completing your Bachelor's Degree program in Business Administration-Management at Malawi Adventist University. 

It's heartening to hear about the support from your family, especially your father and brother, as well as other well-wishers. Extended families often provide a strong foundation, and your story reflects the strength that comes from such bonds.

I can imagine the pride your family must feel, and you should be proud of yourself as well. Graduating in July 2023 is a significant accomplishment, and I'm sure it marks the beginning of a new chapter for you. As you move forward, may your education and experiences continue to shape a bright and fulfilling future.
07/12/23, 2:31 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much we really do truly appreciate it.
It’s really been nothing but testimonies
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265996406762, Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention.

Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand.

07/12/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
07/12/23, 3:24 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok.
07/12/23, 3:25 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: The messages are loud and clear
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
With my counselor we managed to cover four stages. 
Where the first stage look at a brief detail on both ends. Which was mine and Edoofa’s as well. It gave an insight and deep understanding on its goals and what it’s all about. 

Secondly, we have an eligible check where they’re were interviews and other necessary documents and questions 

After Edoofa’s serious consideration, I was luckily enough to be accepted into Edoofa’s scholarship program. Which is the third step.

Lastly, we we’re guided to the right enrollment processes. Which have been fulfilled.

Then the counselor said we leave the rest to here so believe  that’s why this group was made
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and feedback about your counseling session. We're thrilled to see that you have shared such amazing insights with us. The guidance provided by your counselor is absolutely right, from now on we will be here for you to guide you further for your journey.

09/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/12/23, 3:51 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very clear. Very interesting
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/12/23, 3:58 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I’m on track
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If possible can you expand more on this
09/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If possible
09/12/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, we will have a detail discussion about this soon in our upcoming session.
09/12/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
09/12/23, 4:06 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright great
09/12/23, 4:06 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: You can proceed
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
09/12/23, 4:15 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Lovely. Please do
09/12/23, 4:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, let me share all the videos with you and I am sure you must be excited for the videos.
09/12/23, 4:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996406762 , I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
09/12/23, 4:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
09/12/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know by when you will be able to go through the videos?
09/12/23, 4:28 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I am about to start
09/12/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, please let me know once you are done with the videos.
09/12/23, 5:02 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I’m done watching
09/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
09/12/23, 5:17 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Okay.
The videos in summary are explaining about the enrollment process and Edoofa’s vision for us scholars. It’s really comforting to know that Edoofa  has 20 years experience and takes its time to ensure and guide student towards their paths and education rather the right university selection. To top that off it’s other focus is on providing employable education which is very helpful.
The systematicness of the Edoofa’s process is very nice putting into consideration the example of the student from Ghana who tried to get their higher education in China.

However the statement of purpose is the most touching of them all because not only is giving a reflection to as why the student is the right fit but also giving a sense of self awareness
09/12/23, 5:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265996406762 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
09/12/23, 5:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes i am able to understand. Thank you for enlightening us
09/12/23, 5:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
09/12/23, 5:29 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes we are moving together
09/12/23, 5:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday at 2:00 PM.
09/12/23, 5:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

09/12/23, 5:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright trying my best from this end.

11/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Freda, I hope you had an amazing weekend. 

Thank you for sharing the confirmation regarding SOP form. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready for today's session? <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:23 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes. Scheduled for 4pm right?
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, Our session is scheduled for 2:00pm as we discussed on Saturday please. However, If you want to reschedule our session, we can definitely do that dear
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
11/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: No we can proceed
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (15-Dec-2023).
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/ChhIgNyB5c73ASpMSd1Zbk
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Freda Mbozi, and my EWYL group name is Freda EWYL23E0996. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (15-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok. That will done shortly
11/12/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that @265996406762. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Masters in Business Administration* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very accurate
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes that much is true
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @265996406762 . Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Great
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/12/23, 2:52 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well noted
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: My JCE results have finally been sorted
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Could please expand more on this
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your JCE document with us @265996406762, I'll update the same in our records. Let's move ahead with the session -
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/12/23, 3:17 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes we’re on the same page
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/12/23, 3:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I’m following
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
11/12/23, 3:33 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If I may ask wasn’t it $2000-3000 per annum?
11/12/23, 3:33 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, You are absolutely right dear that your cost of education range is between $2000 - $3000 and with the example shared above we have shared the cost of education is $2800 which falls under the same range. However, I would like to highlight that this is the example not your actual cost of education, I hope you understand?
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok i understand. Very clear
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/12/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/12/23, 3:49 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m on track
11/12/23, 3:50 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes this we are aware
11/12/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/12/23, 4:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: No queries at all
11/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
11/12/23, 4:31 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: *Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms. Saloni and he/she has scheduled my session for 01:30 to 02:30*
11/12/23, 4:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 4:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Saloni. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
11/12/23, 4:35 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow great news
11/12/23, 4:35 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Lovely
11/12/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed Freda. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
11/12/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/12/23, 4:43 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Amazing
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/12/23, 4:57 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I have read them all
11/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/12/23, 4:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright great
11/12/23, 5:02 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Wow. This is nice
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/12/23, 5:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes this is quite considerate
11/12/23, 5:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/12/23, 5:30 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Understood
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/12/23, 5:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/12/23, 5:35 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I’m following
11/12/23, 5:36 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If any question arises I will not hesitate to ask
11/12/23, 5:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @265996406762, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
11/12/23, 5:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very excited
11/12/23, 5:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
11/12/23, 5:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

12/12/23, 12:38 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Have a good day as well
14/12/23, 9:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Freda,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright thank you very much. Yes we are happy upon receiving such news
15/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much
15/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: We really did have several inquiries
15/12/23, 4:05 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: The first one being. It is mentioning Zimbabwe while I am from Malawi
15/12/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @265996406762, I am glad to know that you are happy and excited. Thank you for letting me know about the error, I have share the same with the team.
15/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 4:14 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you
15/12/23, 4:15 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Okay sure. 
But the other major issue has to do with the 15 day time limit
15/12/23, 4:15 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: You can proceed
15/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that @265996406762, we will discuss about the same in our session.
15/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 4:33 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: 1.The tuition fee after the scholarship is 1000 USD

2.The duration of the course is for 2 years

3. That’s the caution fee which is 25USD

4. The registration fee which will also assist  Visa payments is 750USD
15/12/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response, I want to share that your Admission and Procedure Fee is $300. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a two-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 4 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 4:53 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes it is
15/12/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 5:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 5:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 5:09 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes yes that much is true. We are still under discussion on that to see which one suits best with the costs
15/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 5:16 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes it does
15/12/23, 5:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/12/23, 5:31 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: That’s clear
15/12/23, 5:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/12/23, 5:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/12/23, 5:45 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: While we appreciate your guidance through the registration process, we here in Malawi are going through financial crisis and shortage of forex. Am yet to pay 150 dollars to Edoofa whose dateline is 1 January due to the same foreign currency issues. Is this 15 day period rigid/ cast in stone that it cannot be extended
15/12/23, 5:46 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Also considering that School starts in September 24
15/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know about your concern @265999951305, I hope you understand that these deadline lines are share by the university hence it's important to complete the registration process within a given timeframe. However, we can discuss about the same more in detail. For now, Let me discuss the details about the offer letter. I hope you understand?
15/12/23, 5:57 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Yes go ahead
15/12/23, 5:57 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you but this doesn’t fully answer the concern
15/12/23, 5:58 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Sorry can you share more light
15/12/23, 5:58 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Before proceeding
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would love to help you here @265996406762, however we will address this concern at the end of session. I want to share all the details with you and help you understand your offer letter better so that you have all the information and details. Please don't worry I'll definitely be shed more light on this. I hope you understand?
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Okay thank you very much
15/12/23, 6:06 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I understand
15/12/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @265996406762 In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 6:22 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes please do
15/12/23, 6:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 6:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *December 28th, 2023.* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 6:33 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Understood
15/12/23, 6:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 6:43 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Though this is kind of flexible a bit. It will also depends on forex availability here. The banks are very restrictive here. You may wish to find out hence our request for extension and liniency
15/12/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 6:45 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: It's Malawi not Zimbabwe. Lilongwe
15/12/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for that @265999951305. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
15/12/23, 6:52 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: I don't have a foreign exchange bank account. Those other methods are not easy here though I have a Visa card but you have to go through the banks and apply which is not as easy as in other countries
15/12/23, 6:52 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: It’s Malawi Lilongwe
15/12/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern @265999951305, however  you can revert to the payment method you previously used which is PayGlocal for your enrollment fee.
15/12/23, 8:16 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I guess while we wait for the response if there’s further clarifications you can make them
15/12/23, 8:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/12/23, 8:28 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Noted
15/12/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/12/23, 8:34 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Great👏
15/12/23, 8:34 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes very clear
15/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 8:42 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes it does. A lot. So EWYL is only applicable annually not per semester?
15/12/23, 8:42 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: I can see how much financial relief it would bring
15/12/23, 8:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996406762 You can pay your tuition fees with the help of EWYL credits, and you are correct as with EWYL program you can help your parents financially. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 8:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/12/23, 9:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I will dedicated myself fully
15/12/23, 9:26 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: The only issues that are they are the ones that were addressed by Mr Ben Mbozi
15/12/23, 9:27 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: About the issues we are facing here in Malawi
15/12/23, 9:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996406762 Yes I remember them. For better understanding could you please share all your concern with us ? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 9:28 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: He explained something to do with how our country is facing forex problems and the about the datelines of payments
15/12/23, 9:29 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Being next year august. We assumed that it would have at least given the parents a bit more time to source the money
15/12/23, 9:29 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: As the dates are really tight <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 9:31 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Since he is also working on the Edoofa registration and there’s also University registration
15/12/23, 9:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @265996406762  While I understand your point about the concern with forex, I am sure you are aware that the academic intake for each year begins in the month of August, and accordingly, your academic intake is scheduled for August 2024. Admissions for this intake commenced in September 2023, and we initiated your admission process in due time. Over 300+ students have already secured their scholarship seats. 

As I understand your concern about forex, and I am more than willing to help you here, hence in order to assist you better, May I know by when you will able to find the forex?
15/12/23, 9:37 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: This can only be answered after consultation with banks because there are limitations as to how much you can access and the times as well
15/12/23, 9:37 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: You'll get the feedback as soon as possible
15/12/23, 9:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @265999951305, May I know if you will be able to share an update with us on Monday?
15/12/23, 9:54 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Will try. Thanks
