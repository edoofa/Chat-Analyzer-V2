29/08/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good  Evening Anotidaishe,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
29/08/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 357 6468: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I've observed that you've completed and submitted the Feedback form, and the EWYL form and I'm appreciative of that. Additionally, I would like to inquire whether you've also had the opportunity to fill out and submit the online Student Application form?

29/08/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/08/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes we can
29/08/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yeah I'm done
29/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
29/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes they are very clear
29/08/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/08/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes I'm following
29/08/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/08/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Very clear
29/08/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
29/08/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 799 9362: I have fully understood the whole process and I'm really excited to be part of this. So far so good no queries
29/08/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/08/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes we can
29/08/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, Anotidaishe. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/08/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

I am sharing you with the videos now, dear.
29/08/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

29/08/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
29/08/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

31/08/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Anotidaishe,

31/08/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me. May I know by when you might be able to watch the videos @263717999362 ?
31/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Today I should be done with them
31/08/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, I shall wait for the same.
01/09/23, 12:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Anotidaishe!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you. May I know if you were able to watch the videos?
01/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes I did watch the videos 😊
01/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 799 9362: How are you
01/09/23, 1:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that @263717999362 . So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
01/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 799 9362: The last video has given a view on the SOP and it's preparations where by you will be given a form and asked to fill it whereby you will be answering questions..and also they said everything I talked about with my counselor will also be submitted and all that will help me in making it into college
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.
01/09/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
01/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yeah I'm seeing that clearly now ..Thank you
01/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yeah I also got a clear picture of how they don't just pic colleges but first they look at certain important things before they choose the college
01/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yeah it wants to help a student to be extra ordinary and be able able to different and skilled than the rest of the crowd
01/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
01/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes we are on the same page 😊
01/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
01/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by this evening at 9:00 PM.

01/09/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Business Administration and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
01/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes it is very accurate
01/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
01/09/23, 10:25 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yeah I think I am ready
01/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful . As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
01/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
01/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
01/09/23, 10:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
01/09/23, 10:38 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Yes it is not possible
02/09/23, 10:03 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Anotidaishe. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session as we have relaxed our hours because of the weekend.
02/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 799 9362: Right now I'm at lessons 
What time can we reconnect
I will be done around twelve because I've only just arrived
02/09/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 799 9362: How are you
02/09/23, 10:48 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if you might be comfortable with the timing of 12:30 PM?
02/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 799 9362: Now we are done with the lessons
03/09/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 357 6468: Good  morning  Anotidaishe will be leaving for school today  I don't know if there questions that needs his attention  before  he leaves  as it might be difficult to communicate with him at school  because  the school  does not allow phones
04/09/23, 4:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Anotidaishe.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further on the previous day, as an unexpected meeting came up with the team and my presence was required. 

Thank you for sharing that with me. We shall have a detailed discussion about the same. For the missed session that was planned, I would like to schedule our session this evening at 8:30 PM CAT. Please let me know if this timing works for you?
04/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good afternoon Ano left for school yesterday.  He doesn't have his phone as phones are not allowed at  school. If its ok I will  go through the sessions with you
04/09/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know.  I recognize that attending school might pose challenges for Anotidaishe's participation. I would like you to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only with the parents at times.
04/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Will be glad to participate in whatever needs my attention.
04/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We shall connect at the said hours for the continuation of our session.
04/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Noted thank you
04/09/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. May I know if you are ready to continue with your session for the admission process?
04/09/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good evening  yes we can
04/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Sorry for the late response network is a bit of a challenge
04/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I am now continuing with the session as we have left off.
04/09/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes these have  been discussed
04/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we are
04/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/09/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes I have  thank you
04/09/23, 10:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/09/23, 10:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/09/23, 10:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
04/09/23, 11:54 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Network is a bit of a challenge this side
04/09/23, 11:54 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Network challenges
04/09/23, 11:54 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Since the network is so bad maybe you can put through what i need to go through then I can answer when the network is back
05/09/23, 12:21 am - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we are
05/09/23, 2:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Anotidaishe.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. <This message was edited>
05/09/23, 2:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming, and I understand the network challenges you're facing. <This message was edited>
05/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good  afternoon  Sir. I'm really sorry for the inconveniences. Please advise on the times we are meeting
05/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 630 3660: Ndibatewo titaure
05/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we will work on that. So, shall we proceed with the session?
05/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes, let's proceed
05/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 357 6468: When is the  deadline for the admission fees
05/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the concern with me. The exact deadline will be mentioned in the offer letter shared by the universities. However, most of the deadlines from the universities will be a time span of 2 weeks from the date of issue of the offer letter. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
05/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we are and these offer letter  when can I start  expecting them so that I prepare as well
05/09/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we proceed with the session with a pure consistency. We would be receiving the offer letters in a weeks time.
05/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Ok noted
05/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are on the same page so that we can proceed?
05/09/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we are
05/09/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. Now, moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in November 2023. Considering the reasons you've provided and the date of commencement in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program in November as agreed upon.
05/09/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
05/09/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session Tomorrow at 01:00 pm to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
05/09/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 357 6468: I'm Ano,s mother Anotidaishe has gone back to school and phones are not allowed. I shall  be available on his behalf
05/09/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 357 6468: I will be available at 1pm if there are any changes will communicate with you
05/09/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow for our next session. 

Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
05/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good night to you too  and thank you
06/09/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Anotidaishe, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
06/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes  let's begin
06/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good afternoon
06/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
06/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 357 6468: I have learnt of the Earn While You Learn program EWYL. I'm not sure if there is anything else
06/09/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Anotidaishe, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
06/09/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
06/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes it would
06/09/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the late reply our first slot of the day had just ended.
06/09/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
06/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes would like to hear more
06/09/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
06/09/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 357 6468: No I was not aware
06/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
06/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
06/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 357 6468: I have gone through them  thank you
06/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
06/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
06/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Crystal clear
06/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes it does
06/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/09/23, 10:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes it does
06/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 8, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 8, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 8, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 357 6468: It's very clear.  I like the fact that the payments are staggered  thus becoming easier to manage
06/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is indeed. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Please share the information.
06/09/23, 10:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it was a long day for me and our available hours have ended. I would like us to reconnect again tomorrow, please. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well. <This message was edited>
06/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you and good night to you too
07/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Anotidaishe,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
07/09/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Hi can  we catch up  a bit later I'm on the road . Good afternoon
07/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please let me know when you are available to proceed.
07/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Is 1930hrs ok
07/09/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is fine we we shall connect at the said time frame.
07/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good evening
07/09/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Anotidaishe, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
07/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes let's begin
07/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I will be continuing where we last left off.
07/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
07/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Ok thanks for the information
07/09/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
07/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Great news
08/09/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Anotidaishe.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
08/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good afternoon  yes I'm available  let's proceed
08/09/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that with continuation to our previous message. On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
08/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes it's clear
08/09/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
08/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Right
09/09/23, 9:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are having a lovely Morning. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further. How are you doing today?
09/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 357 6468: Morning how are you.  I'm good  yes we can continue
09/09/23, 10:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
09/09/23, 10:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
09/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 357 6468: That's great
09/09/23, 10:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/09/23, 10:17 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/09/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 357 6468: I'm clear
09/09/23, 11:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree


Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
09/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 357 6468: Ok
09/09/23, 11:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/09/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 357 6468: Crystal clear
09/09/23, 11:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/09/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you for that but for me that's  not an option  would want to complete my education
09/09/23, 11:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
09/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 357 6468: Yes they are clear
09/09/23, 11:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Hence, I shall conclude our session for today and let us connect on Monday. Have a great weekend.
09/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you have a blessed one  too
11/09/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Anotidaishe. How are you doing this lovely evening?
11/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good evening how are you
11/09/23, 8:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. I am great, thank you for asking. Anotidaishe, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
11/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes I did
11/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
11/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 357 6468: My parents  liked the idea of  registering  early as it has an added advantage on securing a place  for yourself early
11/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
11/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 357 6468: My mom is away on business so it's just me
11/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear.
11/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
11/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
11/09/23, 10:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
11/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes I do
12/09/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Anotidaishe.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 


Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
12/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 357 6468: I'm good and you.  Can we resume at 1900 if possible  I'm a bit tied up with school
12/09/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is alright we shall connect at the said time.
12/09/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you
14/09/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Anotidaishe, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
14/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good afternoon to you too.  Yes we can
14/09/23, 1:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
14/09/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
14/09/23, 1:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
14/09/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Clear
14/09/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
14/09/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we  can
14/09/23, 1:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 1st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
14/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Can't this be staggered
14/09/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As for the standard admission procedure the the registration fees are required to be paid all at a lumpsum within a time span of 15 days. <This message was edited>
14/09/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Oh ok
14/09/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If we are on the same page shall we proceed with the session?
14/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we are
14/09/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
14/09/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
14/09/23, 1:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, the deadline becomes the 1st of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 17th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 1st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 1st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
14/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we are on the same page
14/09/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
14/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 357 6468: They are very clear
14/09/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
14/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 357 6468: I have  understood that  the registration fee is 750 and assuming you have a grant of 150 your registration fee will be reduced to 600  the 150 having to be paid by Edoofa Academic  Board.
14/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 357 6468: You will  pay the remaining  600 in 2 parts the 1st instalment being 15 days of when you get an offer letter  and the last 300 end October
14/09/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
14/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Clear
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *1st October* and *1st November*.
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *1st October* and *1st November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Anotidaishe’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
14/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Let me consult my parents  will get back to you at 1900hrs today
14/09/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we shall connect in the evening. Have a great day ahead.
14/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you
16/09/23, 10:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Anotidaishe. How are you doing today?
16/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 357 6468: Good morning to you too we are well  thank you
16/09/23, 10:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, regarding our previous conversation, may I know if your parents are connected with us to give the go-ahead for your university scholarship application? <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 357 6468: Yes please do go ahead
16/09/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we can do that, I would request the same permission from your parents as well, please.
16/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 357 6468: This is Ano,s mom we are using the same handset
16/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 357 6468: Please do go ahead
16/09/23, 10:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Name’s university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *1st October* and *1st November*.) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
16/09/23, 1:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are connected?
16/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes we are
16/09/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to give me a reply to my above message, please? <This message was edited>
16/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes I can meet the deadlines
16/09/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Anotidaishe’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board.

16/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Yes will do if I have any  queries.  Thanks again
20/09/23, 8:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anotidaishe!

20/09/23, 8:04 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you so much noted and good morning
20/09/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you are so happy about the offer letter please. Moving ahead, it becomes my responsibility to make sure that you can have proper clarity and understanding of the letter. For me to be able to do that, may I know if you have been through the letter by now?
20/09/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Not yet  as I'm a bit busy at the moment
20/09/23, 1:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. Once you are done going through the letter, please let me know.
20/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Will do thank you
21/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anotidaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/09/23, 10:24 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are done going through the offer letter by now please?
21/09/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 357 6468: Yes I'm done  going  through  it. Good morning to you too
21/09/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. 

In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
21/09/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 357 6468: 1) 900
2) 3years
3)300
21/09/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 357 6468: 4)750
21/09/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
21/09/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 357 6468: Clear
21/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
21/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/09/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/09/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 357 6468: Ok
21/09/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
21/09/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 357 6468: We are together
21/09/23, 10:57 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
21/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 357 6468: Yes it's clear
21/09/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
21/09/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 357 6468: Clear
21/09/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
21/09/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 04th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 04th November 2023.*
21/09/23, 10:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $750 within 15 working days by *04th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
21/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 357 6468: Yes it's clear
21/09/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/09/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 357 6468: Harare
21/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 357 6468: Thanks
21/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
21/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 357 6468: It's OK  will choose  one of the options  please  send
21/09/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you
21/09/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
21/09/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 357 6468: Noted
21/09/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/09/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/09/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 357 6468: Yes iam
21/09/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
21/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 357 6468: Ooh ok
21/09/23, 11:50 am - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Can he switch  to another program.  Will that be possible
21/09/23, 2:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know why is it that you wish for him to switch the program please?
21/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Would want to enquire about  any computer  science programs
21/09/23, 3:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask why is it that you now wish for Anotidaishe to pursue a Computer Science Program?
21/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 357 6468: We were just wondering about  other options. Sorry  if I seem  to be going back
21/09/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, however, I wish to know about the reason that you are planning to consider other options?
21/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 357 6468: We have seen  that as Ano is doing  computer science at Alevel he might also consider venturing into  that
21/09/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, I understand that now. Coming to that, when Anotidaishe's A-Level Results will arrive, then on the basis of that we will discuss about which course would be the best fit for him, I believe this is clear?
21/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you and its clear
21/09/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Do you have any other queries as well that you would like to ask?
21/09/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 357 6468: In terms of earning points when  does this start
22/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anotidaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/09/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
22/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Good afternoon to you  too yes we can proceed
22/09/23, 1:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding this, I would like to mention that once Anotidaishe will return from school his EWYL Program will start at that time and then by working on the projects as well as the other activities, he will earn scholarship credits. I hope this is clear?
22/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 357 6468: It is clear
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
22/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 357 6468: For  now I'm good thanks
22/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
22/09/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

26/09/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anotidaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, please, I understand. Now, It's great to know that you spoke with your family about your career and I'm confident they were happy to see you making progress in the right direction. How did the conversation with your family go? What were their thoughts?
26/09/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 357 6468: The conversation  went well.  They are very happy and  doing everything in their  power to make sure they are able to meet  deadlines on the payments

26/09/23, 4:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them?
26/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 357 6468: It will come in 2 parts
26/09/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand and you can surely do that, and I will inform the university authorities about our conversation today.

I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 11:12 am - Milan Edoofa: As per the discussion that we had earlier, you were planning to make the payment of your registration fee yesterday, hence, can you please share an update with me about the same so that I can relay the same information to the university officials as well.
05/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 357 6468: Morning  sorry  I  was out of town  cab I deposit  the money today
05/10/23, 11:19 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, thank you for letting me know. May I know by when would you be able to complete the payment so that I can relay the same information from the side of the university please?
05/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 357 6468: Today  it will  be done
05/10/23, 11:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please.
05/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 357 6468: Banking details please
05/10/23, 11:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the Banking Details, can you please confirm which mode of payment will you be using so that I can share the same with you here?
05/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 357 6468: Transfer last payment was done through Charles Jerera
05/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Here are Mr. Jerera's account details please:

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
05/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 357 6468: Thank you
05/10/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 357 6468: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.
05/10/23, 11:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, I believe, you have not included the 11% transfer charges with this payment, right?
05/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 357 6468: Let  me do the maths I have only done  a deposit of 300
05/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 357 6468: I'm not sure if it's inclusive of the 11%
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Since the fee that was due was $300, then along with the 11% transfer charges, you had to pay a total of $333. However, since you have only paid $300, the balance charges will be added to the second part of the registration fee, is that clear?
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 357 6468: Crystal clear
05/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 8:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

14/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anotidaishe,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
14/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
14/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
