18/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
18/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
18/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
18/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 987 5652: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Is it needed soon because for the mean time my school is in far away from Harare and as well mostly inZimbabwe recommendation  letter are given after results are out but I can try to reach my O level administration to do this for me since there are already out but truly speaking I cannot mention  the exact dates for the letter I have to go and confirm  since my schools  are all far far away from my residential area and there are in different  provinces... Let me try to be quick....
18/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, You can try contacting our school officials, but please try to keep us posted on the progress of the document.
18/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes let me try so
18/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I am
18/12/23, 5:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 987 5652: We can do it
18/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I'm done
18/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
18/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please
18/12/23, 5:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
18/12/23, 5:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/12/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/12/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/12/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I'm in
18/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok
18/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 987 5652: We can proceed
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
