If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
23/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes we can start
23/11/23, 4:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Am done with the stages <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
23/11/23, 5:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
23/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes they are clear
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/11/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
23/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l am
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
23/11/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes they are, so these stages will happen when the results are out or now
23/11/23, 5:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 Let me share that we will proceed with these stages from today itself, May I know if you are ready for the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office* ?
23/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes  am ready
23/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/11/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
23/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes let's move forward

23/11/23, 5:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect today at 9:30 pm for our next session. I hope by then you will be able to go through all the videos. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
23/11/23, 5:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Enjoy the video @263785471606, you will get amazing insight from them
23/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 547 1606: For students to have a successful journey with Edoofa they must have 2 important qualities that is :
1. The student should be teachable and must be open minded
2. The students must follow Edoofa instructions
23/11/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263785471606, May I please know if you have completed the videos?
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Edoofa' s vision through the steels that's ( student of Edoofa Earning and Learning to success)is to increase the student's capacity for success thus making students more responsible and independent for example if we put a cup and a huge tank in a sea they are going to hold different quantities of water because of the capacity, that is a cup is going to hold a small quantity than the tank
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Edoofa gas invested a lot of time to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians
23/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Statement of purpose is an important document, which students must fill in order to convince the admission board of universities
23/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l have completed
23/11/23, 9:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263785471606 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success.

24/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 547 1606: 3 *. The understanding of GAAP and it's importance* ?
 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principle refers to a common set of accounting rules , standards and procedures issued by the financial Accounting Standards Board { FASB} . GAAP had got four basic principles that is costs , revenue recognition, matching and disclosure.

 *Cost principle* ~ refers to the fact that all listed values are accurate and reflect only actual costs , rather than any market value of thee cost items.

 *Revenue recognition principle* ~ when you are recording information about the business you need to consider the period of time when revenues are recognized through the income statement.

 *Matching principle* ~ expenses should be matched to revenues recognized in the same accounting period.

 *Full disclosure principle* ~ the information on financial statement should be completed so that nothing is misleading.

The importance of GAAP is to ensure a company's financial statements are complete , consistent and comparable. This makes it easier for investors to analyze and extract useful information from the company's financial statements and accurate cross - company comparison
GAAP compliant accountants strictly adhere to established rules and regulations. Consistent standards are applied throughout the financial reporting process and they are also committed to accuracy and impartiality 

In conclusion, GAAP helps govern the world of accounting according to general rules and guidelines. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 5:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please make sure to complete them and then we can start our today's session.
24/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 547 1606: *4. What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory?* 

An accounting standard is a common set of standards, procedures, and principles that define the basis of financial accounting practices and policies. 

 They are used for accounting functions such as bookkeeping, determining estimates, preparing financial statements, and required note disclosures.

Accounting standards apply to all aspects of a business including assets, revenue, liabilities, expenses, and shareholders’ equity.

 Accounting standards are used to improve the transparency of financial reporting. They specify how and when economic events are to be measured, as well as recognized, and disclosed. 

These standards are also used by external entities like banks, investors, and regulatory agencies. They rely on accounting standards to make sure that they are receiving accurate and relevant information. 

Therefore, accounting standards work as a way to ensure transparency and comparability in financial reporting, as well as setting the boundaries for reporting measures.

Accounting standards ensure the financial statements from multiple companies are comparable. Because all entities follow the same rules, accounting standards make the financial statements credible and allow for more economic decisions based on accurate and consistent information.


In conclusion, accounting standards are a vital part of worldwide accounting. They help to bring consistency, as well as make documents easily comparable. They  allow investors to get a clear view on a business’s operations and make an informed decision.
24/11/23, 7:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 May I please know how much time will it take dear to complete the document?
24/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 547 1606: *5. Differentiate between accounting and auditing?* 

 Accounting is the daily process of recording financial transactions, managing data, and maintaining records. Auditing is a periodic process that focuses on ensuring the accuracy and legality of financial statements. There are different types of accountants and different types of auditors.

 *Documentation* : Auditing typically only covers final financial statements. Accounting involves developing statements and current financial transactions.

 *Deliverables* : Accountants may deliver an income statement, balance sheet, or any other financial statements. Auditors only deliver an audit report.
Accounts: Accountants create financial accounts for a business. They work with accounts in progress at every stage of development. Auditors only work with final accounts.

 *Reporting* : Accountants report to their employers or clients. Auditors will submit their audit report to shareholders or legal entities.
Payment: Accountants are usually company employees who are paid with a regular salary. Companies will pay an auditor’s fee after they perform the audit from an external body. 

 *Scope* : The scope of accounting is determined by the clients or employer. The scope of auditing is determined by the law. 

 *Time* : Accounting is a continuous practice. Auditing is done on a periodic or as-needed basis. 
Objectivity and independence

In summation, accounting and auditing deliver related benefits in different ways. Both roles are vital to risk management, increased transparency, and data-driven decision making.
24/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Am only left with SOP my network it's a bit slow  but in 45 minutes l think l will be done
24/11/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, in that case you can complete the form. In the meantime, Let's start our today's session.
24/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Tuesday (28-Nov-2023).
24/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/JxHS1kVkjw85FTNdEkyjaV
24/11/23, 8:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Adonai Munkuli, and my EWYL group name is Adonai EWYL23E0947. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (28-Nov-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
24/11/23, 8:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
24/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
24/11/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BCom* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
24/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes it's very accurate
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Noted
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
24/11/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
24/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 8:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
24/11/23, 8:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
24/11/23, 8:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
24/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes we discussed about it
24/11/23, 8:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
24/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes we are
24/11/23, 8:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
24/11/23, 8:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
24/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 547 1606: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l have
24/11/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
24/11/23, 8:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000= $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
24/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 547 1606: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay noted
24/11/23, 8:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
24/11/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
24/11/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
24/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
24/11/23, 9:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 547 1606: I don't have any queries
24/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/11/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
24/11/23, 9:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
24/11/23, 9:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Thank you
24/11/23, 9:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263785471606, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
24/11/23, 9:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
24/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Noted
24/11/23, 9:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
24/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
24/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
24/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
24/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Let's proceed
24/11/23, 9:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
24/11/23, 9:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
24/11/23, 9:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Ok
24/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
24/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
24/11/23, 9:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 9:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
24/11/23, 9:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 9:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
24/11/23, 9:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
24/11/23, 9:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
24/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Nothing
24/11/23, 9:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 547 1606: You may provide more information
24/11/23, 9:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
24/11/23, 9:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
24/11/23, 9:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
24/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 547 1606: So what about if the student passes with flying colors the scholarship percentage will it increase
24/11/23, 10:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263785471606, In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
24/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
24/11/23, 10:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
24/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes yes
24/11/23, 10:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
24/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay, however if the student does very well you can be able to change for him the course and do a better course which is more marketable
24/11/23, 10:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, May I please know if you are asking this out of curiosity or you want to change your course?
24/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Am asking out of curiosity because on social media l come across new courses  which l never knew that they do exist but currently am satisfied with my course which l chose
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I can understand that however I would like to mention that your course is also one of the best course, preferred by the edoofians.
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
24/11/23, 10:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
24/11/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 10:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 10:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
24/11/23, 10:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
24/11/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Everything is clear
24/11/23, 10:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that @263785471606,  So are you excited to initiate the process?

Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment.

15/12/23, 4:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263785471606, As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes
15/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 547 1606: 1. 0
2.0
3. $1250
4.$125 each
5. $1000
15/12/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 547 1606: It is
15/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 342 6039: Very much so
15/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yah it is
15/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 342 6039: Yes it does
15/12/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Adonai's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill. <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make your education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes l have a request
15/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 547 1606: As a family we set down and discussed that Galgotias university will be better for us since they are many people whom we know including those who referred us to Edoofa scholarship so Galgotias university will be more like of a home to us ( my twin brother and me)
15/12/23, 5:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/12/23, 5:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. As you have mentioned about Galgotias University, we will check the status of your application with them.
15/12/23, 5:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 342 6039: Yes we are. It means in the meantime we will wait to hear from other universities and make an informed decision
15/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 71 342 6039: We also checked the rankings
15/12/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Well noted we are hopeful that they will accept our application
15/12/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, at the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Galgotias University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
15/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 342 6039: Not aware may you shed light <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
15/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 71 342 6039: Is the transfer possible before one commences the studies or also available when one is already in India
15/12/23, 6:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN University by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN University without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/12/23, 6:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $1000 to MVN University to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $1000 .

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $1000 , but because you would have already paid $1000 for MVN University , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $1000 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
15/12/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I please know if we are still connected as I am looking forward for your response please?
15/12/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay it's clear
15/12/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Sorry the phones were flat we have electricity challenges this side
15/12/23, 9:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that you are having electricity challenges, May I know if we can continue with the session now?
15/12/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes we can but my parents are currently offline
15/12/23, 9:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 We can continue with discussion about your offer letter and once your parents are available, they can review our conversation. If they have any questions later on, I will be more than happy to assist them. Does this approach work for you?
15/12/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes it does
15/12/23, 9:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 9:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/12/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay can l ask let's say if l get $1200 scholarship credits which means l am going to pay just $300
15/12/23, 9:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263785471606, Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1500. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1500- $1000 = $500, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes it is
15/12/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 547 1606: So these scholarship credits will start on my first year or second
15/12/23, 9:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 You can start using these credits for the first year dear.
15/12/23, 9:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 9:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $500 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
15/12/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes you are
15/12/23, 10:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263785471606. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/12/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes it is
15/12/23, 10:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 28th, 2023*.
15/12/23, 10:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Yes you can explain
15/12/23, 10:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450 before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 10:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay noted ..... Since we are 2 and my twin brother will you be flexible to give us 3 months to pay it
15/12/23, 10:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 I believe there is no such extension allowed however May I know why are you asking this dear?
15/12/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Because it was a short notice and l thought that the $ 1 000 we are going to start paying it next year
15/12/23, 10:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: While I understand your point, I am sure you are aware that the academic intake for each year begins in the month of August, and accordingly, your academic intake is scheduled for August 2024. Admissions for This intake commenced in September 2023, hence the registration fees is needed so that you can reserve your seat at the university. Over 300+ students have already secured their scholarship seats. 

As I understand your concern, I want to know what is the concern regarding the registration fees?
15/12/23, 10:39 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay noted
15/12/23, 10:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 10:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
15/12/23, 10:44 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Nop l stay in Bulawayo
15/12/23, 10:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/12/23, 10:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/12/23, 10:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/12/23, 10:52 pm - +263 78 547 1606: So they is no any other way l can pay except going to Harare because it's risky to carry such huge sums of money and travel such distance to Harare
15/12/23, 10:52 pm - +263 78 547 1606: So he is going to give me a receipt
15/12/23, 10:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/12/23, 10:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/12/23, 10:56 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Okay
15/12/23, 10:57 pm - +263 78 547 1606: Mr Rajan doesn't he have an account where l can deposit the money into his account
15/12/23, 10:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263785471606 I have share Mr. Rajan contact details with you can contact him for more details. Let me also share Mr. Charles details with you.

Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
