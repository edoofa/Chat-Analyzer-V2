This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

22/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!.

I hope you're having a fine evening today. I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer starting today. I would like to inform you that I will be taking over your session for the admission process, as Mr. Milan has been assigned to a new role as informed to you. I am pleased to let you know that he will be there upon your arrival in India to guide you through the university and you will be meeting him in person.

With that said our team has dedicated considerable time to refine and enhance your upcoming educational journey for 2025. We've honed in on an improved approach and I'm excited to share these insights with you. Let's delve into the details together tomorrow at 6:00 PM. In the meantime, please take a look at the insights provided to you. Have a great night and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
22/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.

23/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, based on our experience of over 14 years and after helping over 5000 students from different countries, what we have realized is financial planning is the most important factor when we think about higher education abroad. And to help the students and parents with that, the Edoofa Management has come up with a financially secure plan that will help you plan for your child’s higher education without stress and last-minute rush.
23/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Over the last 7 years, we have seen that 20-30% of students who take admission are unable to come to India because of lack of financial planning. The money required to book flights, and pay for accommodation and food after arrival is something that takes a toll and they are unable to send the child in that year and decide to defer the admission which creates a gap in education for the child. So, the Edoofa Secure Plan will reduce the financial pressure and smoothen the journey of sending your child to India.
23/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are in the month of November 2023 now and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for the finances. As you have been informed during the counseling session that we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees, the cost of education including the food, accommodation would be between $2000-$3000 and can even be less as well but not more, which means if you are able to save $150 per month for the next 20 months you will be able to save $3000 which is more than enough for the first year university fee which includes tuition fees (if any), food and accommodation.
23/11/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That means by the time your child will be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first year fee. Now, in these 20 months, I am sure the child will also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if the child secures to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years is already secured. Now, for a 3 year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 year, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent is easy and smooth. Do you agree to this?
23/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Wow interesting,yes l agree to what you are saying sir
23/11/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, also, there is another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different. Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, mugging everyday. And in that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank requires a Nostro Account which means you have to pay to the bank to keep your money safe, right?
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Yes its correct sir
23/11/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, the Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save the money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Let me explain how:

Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months. Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Yes can you tell me the reason
23/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The reason is on the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will start to work on the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities so as to secure the scholarship and seat in the university. The earlier the seats are reserved, the higher the chances of securing a maximum quantum of scholarship, the higher the scholarship is the lesser the fee is and not only that, by securing the seat we are also entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university and not the new structure which will be implemented in January 2025. To continue, when we apply to the university, you will be given the letter of intent where the fee, scholarship and registration fee will be mentioned. As explained by the counselor during the enrollment, the registration fee is a part of the first-year university fee which is paid to reserve the seat in the university. It varies from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. Now, from the $1500 which is saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university to reserve the seat. For example, if the registration fee is $700, that means, Edoofa will pay $700 from the $1500 which you paid in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $800 which will again be paid to the university when you come to India. This becomes a great relief to the parent as they don’t have to pay anything immediately after the student comes to India. The $800 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year as it will be mentioned in the admission letter.
23/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: What do you think about it?
24/11/23, 7:46 am - +263 78 725 5242: Its amazing and it will give my parents time to save money
25/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I'd like to reschedule our missed session for Monday at 5:30 PM. If the timing poses any challenges, please feel free to reach out to me. Have a wonderful week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family.
25/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Thank you for your thoughtful message!Please don't worry about missing our session, l understand that unforeseen events sometimes occur.
27/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Good afternoon to you too! We're feeling energized and ready to face the week ahead, thanks for asking. It's nice to start the week by hearing from you!
27/11/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, you must be wondering about the remaining 10 months, right?
27/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Yes I'm eager to know
27/11/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th month, which is 4 months. Once the 4 months is completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process, the bank statement will act as one of the required documents and you will receive the visa. Once the visa is received, you can deposit from the deposits of 4 months in FBC, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you to utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
27/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Wow, that's an interesting and strategic plan. It makes sense to have the money deposited in the FBC Mastercard account and use it to secure the Visa and book our flight ticket. It will be a relief to know that the money can be used for multiple purposes. I appreciate the detailed explanation of how this will work.
27/11/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose.  Have you understood?
27/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 725 5242: Yes l understand thank you for explaining
27/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 5:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 7:33 am - +263 78 725 5242: Thank you sir
29/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students.

During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual.

With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
