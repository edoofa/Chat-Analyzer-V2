15/12/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Tafadzwa 2K23NOV1575)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
15/12/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tafadzwa EWYL23E0987)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
15/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 532 6491: Yes it is very clear
15/12/23, 7:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
16/12/23, 7:55 am - +263 77 246 9142: Good day. My apologies for failing to respond yesterday, I guess we were all offline.... I will start with question, Is it ok to send messages outside the operating hours? If not please let us know. 

The Edoofa scholarship program has impressed us and the following are the areas I think are impressive 👇
16/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 246 9142: The Edoofa program is well designed and organised. 

The counseling sessions are so impressive as the give insights into how the program works.

The counselors are so good, that one can easily follow and understand the program aspects.a

The unique EWYL program, where Tafadzwa will get real time live projects which I believe will give her work experience as well as earn her scholarship credit points . These points can then be used to pay for her university fees making it affordable for us. 

An impressive aspect is that the credits can earn from 50% upto 100% > thus Tafadzwa has an opportunity to work for her fees prior to attending varsity.

The program gives an opportunity to access 250+ universities in India at affordable fees.
16/12/23, 10:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Tafadzwa!
