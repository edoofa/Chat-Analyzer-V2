27/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, it can be challenging sometimes. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes we can start
27/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok sir noted
27/09/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/09/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
27/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok
27/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes noted
27/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes noted
27/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes
27/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Wonderful
27/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Fantastic
27/09/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/09/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir we can start
27/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir
27/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
27/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

27/09/23, 10:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

29/09/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Blessing

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. I am glad that you have watched the videos. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for your admission process?
29/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir we can start
29/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

29/09/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tuesday 5:30 PM.
29/09/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1.

This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Proceed then .He is available
04/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir I'm available
04/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir it's correct
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir we can start
04/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/10/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok noted
04/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Wonderful sir
04/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok noted
04/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yaaa that's true
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/10/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok sir noted
04/10/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Fantastic
04/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Correct
04/10/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir
04/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 390 2274: That's awesome ,!
04/10/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/10/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/10/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir .. l understood clearly.. thank you
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 71 627 6510: It's ok sir .. good night
04/10/23, 11:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Blessing EWYL23E0707*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/DRvFtmZoxx6LO5Q58MclOC"
04/10/23, 11:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Blessing Gwerete and my EWYL group name is Blessing EWYL23E0707.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
04/10/23, 11:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
06/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Hello Admission officers, l have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms Aditi
09/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student.

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you lately. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir I am available
09/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With regards to our previous conversation, may I know if you are clear and currently on the same page to further proceed with the session?
09/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Proceed then
09/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 390 2274: But we facing network problem
09/10/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir we can start
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Noted
09/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok sir noted
09/10/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's great
09/10/23, 7:07 pm - +263 71 627 6510: No problem for now
09/10/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

09/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's fantastic news

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?

09/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's wonderful sir
09/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir l am ready

09/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir we can move
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 71 627 6510: I am a boy sir .
09/10/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 627 6510: I understood
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have taken a note of it, please excuse me for the error.
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's great
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 627 6510: No problem sir
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Noted
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Noted
09/10/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir .. I understood
09/10/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 627 6510: It's fantastic sir . Well explained
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Noted sir
09/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Help me sir .. you are welcome
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok
09/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
09/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's great
09/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
09/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
09/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes I understood
09/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
09/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
09/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir well explained
09/10/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account. <This message was edited>
09/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok sir .. now I understood.. thank you sir
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 627 6510: For now no problem you  explained everything
09/10/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
09/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir I'm looking forward
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok sir noted
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Afternoon
11/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 390 2274: I will be happy if you could give  My son  Blessing  Gwerete the opportunity to learn at Lovely Professional  University
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 390 2274: I like it's strictness
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Blessing.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by MVN University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 01.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 2:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir it's wonderful
17/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Good afternoon
17/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1250 + $250 = $1500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1250. I hope you are clear about that?
17/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 627 6510: We are fine how are you
17/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir I'm clear with that
17/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Can you just explain the amount of money needed to be paid urgently
17/10/23, 3:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please @263716276510 we are coming to discuss that. In order to get proper clarity on the same, you would have to be a bit patient please. Now, I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir I'm clear with that
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok sir
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Understood
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Ok
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1250 and so the balance fee becomes $1250 - $1000 = $250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
17/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes sir that's great
17/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Ok we shall see
17/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That $1000 mentioned.Am I going to pay it in instalments or once
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 28th November 2023.*
17/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 390 2274: We will try if all goes well.
17/10/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 within 15 working days by 28th October 2023. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 390 2274: I'm not financially strong these days
17/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Can't you stretch it up to January since results are not out
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Life is tough here I n Zimbabwe
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 390 2274: People are starving
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 390 2274: I'm trying to make ends meet
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessin!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I understand that the situation might be difficult, however, on that note, there is the payment plan to help you with the same, right?
18/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Can't you give us three chances of universities
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please let me know why is it that you wish for Blessing to go to LPU?
18/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 390 2274: There are many reasons why I want him to learn.
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 390 2274: 1. It's his choice we should not look down upon his choice
18/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 390 2274: 2. That's where his cousin  brother Charles Jerera Learns. 3. Lpu is cheap and it's strict
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

I will discuss your request with the Edoofa Academic Board to see how best we can assist you in making the payments more manageable. However, it's important to note that the first payment needs to be made within this month since the deadline is fast approaching. Hence, if you are ready for that, we can move ahead to plan the same. What are you thoughts?
20/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 390 2274: I kindly ask you to discuss this issue please

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?

20/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Let me ask Mr Jerera
