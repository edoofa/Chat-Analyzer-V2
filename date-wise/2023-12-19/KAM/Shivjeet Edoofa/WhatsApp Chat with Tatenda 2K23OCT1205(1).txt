30/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
30/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Wow thank you for making this clear enough
30/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
30/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes there are clear
30/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you Mr Shivjeet if l face any challenge  l will ask
30/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Wow thank you very much l really understand  now
30/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes we can start

Medical  laboratory Technology have a wide variety of responsibilities in the field of medicine, especially  in the past few decades. It helps in examining and analysing blood, body fluids, tissues and cells, relaying test results to physicians, utilizing microscopes, cell counters and this information is then used by medical team to make decisions regarding a pateince medical care. According  to my reaserch about 85% of all medical decisions are based on the results of laboratory investigations reports, in each system of Medicine diagnosis of the disease it is an important step because no treatment is possible without a proper diagnosis. In todays modern world of technology the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of various diseases depends upon the results of investigation  carried out medical labs.

The principle of Good laboratory Practice is set to assure quality control system covering the organisational process and the conditions under which non-clinical health and environment studies are planned, perfomed, monitored, recorded, repeated and returned. It also helps assure safety especially  when carrying diagnosis of different diseases, such as tb where one can end up being affected. It also assure that labs and other companies ensure integrity, consistency and reproducibility with non-clinical laboratory. Some explames of good lab practice rules  are no food or drink, always wear proper attire, practice of  good hygiene ,participate in safety Exercise, always stay focused and aware of your surroundings.

The different sterilisation methods used in labs are steam under pressure, dry heat(oven) chemical sterilants( glutoraldehydes) or physical agents( radiation), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and etc. Giving example of steam under pressure as 1 of the most common sterilisation methods. This is methodsm which is achieved by exposing  the items to be sterilized  with saturated steam under pressure . Steam enhance the ability of heat to kill microorganisms by reducing the time and temperature required to denature proteins in the microorganism, this is use of thermal energy from high pressure steam to denature DNA and destroy enzyme to kill microbes on the surface of device.
03/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 643 4112: *5. Explain few techniques of placing a sample under microscopy*.

When preparing a slide take a thin slice of your sample and place it on a clean dry slide,then place 1 drope of water  over your sample, place the coverslip at 45 degree angle with one edge touching the water and let go and the slide will be ready to be viewed. After preparing slide insert the slide up for viewing,set light control then focus the microscope and increase magnification until you see a clear image then record the results.

In order to make up for this session, I shall now be scheduling our session for tomorrow morning from 8:30 AM onwards. Please excuse me for the inconvenience. Have a great evening, and please share my warm regards with your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Greetings to you Mr Shivjeet
04/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky sure we may proceed  excuse me my phone was off
04/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Medical Lab Technology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes sir it is correct
04/11/23, 12:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
04/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you . We can proceed
04/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes so l will have to choose on of the best or you help me to choose
04/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Mr Shivjeet  am facing a challenge to submit my statement of purpose l gues its because  of netwrk but l will give you feed back as soon l submitted
04/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you l understand
04/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well.

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Good Afternoon .
I am doing well thank you
06/11/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I have noticed that we are having some challenges with the SOP Form. May I know if you were able to fill that out?
06/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Not yet l am having challenge the everytim l try to submit.
06/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 643 4112: I will try again before 7 today to submit because currently l have low network
06/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand the network issue you're facing. It can be quite frustrating. Thank you for your efforts in trying to submit the SOP Form. If you continue to encounter difficulties, please try to submit when your network is more stable, or if you have access to a more reliable network source. So in the mean time shall we proced with the session?
06/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes we can
06/11/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding this, we will indeed help you with the best choice of your university based on your preferences. May I know if you are clear here as well?
06/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes it is clear now
06/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
06/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
06/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your cou
06/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 643 4112: May l know if there is any part payment that will be offered incase we fail to meet the deadline
06/11/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.

Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee. <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Mr Shivjeet may l know since l have submited the forms how long does it take for me to get an offer letter from any university
06/11/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your documents are with me, and they are yet to be submitted to the university officials for the generation of the offer letter. It will be submitted once we have completed our session with the session of the admission process, and you will be able to receive the letter within a week's time. May I know if we are on the same page here?
06/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky l understand then this means if l get offer letter this month the registration fee will be required before end of Dec l am correct <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are correct. Once you receive the offer letter, the registration fee will be required to be paid by the deadline specified in the offer letter.
06/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 643 4112: So after this what other costs will be required before l come there

06/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. 

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session as my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on tomorrow from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
06/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you
08/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
08/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Greetings to you Mr Shivjeet.
Yes we can proceed
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
08/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes we are on the same page
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
08/11/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Can you explain to me what is Miscellaneous fee <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 643 4112: This message was deleted
08/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l am
08/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The Miscellaneous fees here include the fee that comes as sports fee, library fee, lab fees, etc which you would be using through out your career at the universities. May I know if you are clear here?
08/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 643 4112: So even if l get 100percentage scholarship the fees will be still ranging above $1000 per anum
08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct and the scholarship will be applicable on your tuition fees and the above mentioned are not considered on your tuition fees. May I know if you are getting my point here?
08/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Does EWYL program cover up for my registration fee if it is l get more credits
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing interesting questions the EWYL does not cover your registration fees and it will be only applicable of use on your Tuition fees for the university. The reason being the registration fees are the most important aspect of your university admission process and it it important to not hinder it with the EWYL credits to avoid compromising on it. May I know if you are clear here?
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 643 4112: So even if l come there the EWYL will not cover up for miscellaneous fees also it will be just covering tution fee only?
08/11/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you happen to receive 100% tuition fees your credits can be used to cover your miscellaneous fees as well, dear. This means there is always a use for your Credits.
08/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky its just that l really wanted to understand
08/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 643 4112: And if it is l get less than 100% scholarship for tution if l work hard and get more credits this means the credits can also cover up for tution and both miscellaneous fees
08/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct, dear.
08/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you l understand
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, now if you are clear shall we proceed with the session?
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Sure we can <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
08/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000= $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
08/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 643 4112: But before l was told that if l pay the enroment fee it will reserve my edofa  scholarship seat and now you are saying it is the registration fee that wil securey scholarship seat?
08/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, you have received the Edoofa seat, which means you are an Edoofan now, where you can practice your EWYL (Earn While You Learn) sessions to earn credits to reduce your tuition fees for the university, and receive guidance throughout your career.
09/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 643 4112: Greeting to you Mr Shivjeet
09/11/23, 9:45 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Tatenda!

I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and will be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.

The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

17/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear. I am happy to hear that. How was your exams?
17/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 643 4112: It was fair thank you for asking
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l still recall
17/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000= $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Yes l do understand  but l wanted to ask ..is it always $1000 or this is just an example and it can be less than that
17/11/23, 7:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The above-mentioned numbers are an example and it can be less than that too, dear.
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky sir if it is we  proceed now when are we expected to pay this registration fee and after that is there any other amount that will be required  before l arrive in india
17/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your enthusiasm for that the exact numbers will be mentioned in the offer letter provided in the letter. So with that said shall we proceed with the session?
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky sir
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Can l know the costs that will be covered with edoofa before me
17/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know which cost are you referring to?
17/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 643 4112: For example you are saying the tuition fee the registration fee , miscellaneous fees and accommodation, visa fees and transport will have to cover up for our selves from what l have understands  for now.
17/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 643 4112: So my question  is l wanted to know certain  costs that will be covered with edoofa  or its more like we are just paying everything  by our selves
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The above assumptions are to be paid by the student, and since you have enrolled under Edoofa, we have reduced your overall cost of education from $6000 to $8000 to $1600 to $2300. Please let me know if you are clear on this.
17/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky its clear now we can proceed
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 643 4112: I was expecting the session from 5:30pm then by the time you sent this message my phone was off , we had no electricity
25/11/23, 11:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 643 4112: Its oky we can countinue
25/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
25/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Greetings to ypu
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 643 4112: You
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you am ready to do todays session
27/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Am doing  oky how is you <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Thank you l understand
27/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
27/11/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Oky thank you ..so this means if my registration fee is mote than 750 or less than 750 Edoofa will be jusy paying $100 endowment fee
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct.
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 643 4112: I have followed well thank you
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 643 4112: You can explain to me in more details
27/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 643 4112: Now l see thank.you
27/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parent and my dear student!

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
