21/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 128 5777: To be honest everything about the EDOOFA program is fascinating from the affordability, hospitalityto the earn while you learn program but the employability part set me. The fact that after graduating one can be employable internationally means something to me as employment is a hiccup to most graduates so through programs like EWYL and the higher education l know l will be set to acquire the 21st century jobs that's require skills and intellect
21/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts! It's fantastic to hear that the various facets of the Edoofa program have made a positive impression on you.

23/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 128 5777: lts okay sir we can proceed
23/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright I will be sharing that soon. I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
23/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Well after watching the four videos from the co-founders l had to understand the vision that EDOOFA has for the Edofians and the expectations of the EDOOFA team from their enrolled students. EDOOFIANS are expected to follow instructions at all cost for the smooth functioning of their processes and be open minded at cost.

EDOOFA focuses on enrolling students in the best universities which the founders saw to be idea for the higher education of students, the right environment and infrastructure. With the EWYL program the student get a chance to be independent and employable at the same time thus a student shouldn't worry about getting into the best university because EDOOFA has got that covered
23/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 128 5777: For EDOOFA the legacy it has recommends students that have the right attitude. EDOOFA gets to mould the students with the right skills, knowledge and attitude required in the job market. They achieve that through a series of procedures, from the counseling sessions and all the stages that one takes to be a proud Edoofian and also through the EWYL program. With EDOOFA students do not have to worry about losing their money or paying unnecessary monies because everything is planned out and if the student follows instructions it takes up to 2 months to be transported to lndia without a hassle which sets them apart from other agencies.


The goal of EDOOFA is not to just make profits but to help students achieve their dreams that each day students "wake up with a smile on their faces"not from the higher education only but from the welcoming environment within the selected universities. People in the campuses are welcoming to Africans that they invite them  to their cultural practices" holi"".


There is a lot of good things  to tell about EDOOFA but in a nutshell it is aimed at empowering students and making education affordable, not only that but ensure they equip them with the right skills
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 128 5777: yes
23/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Noted

23/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Well noted

24/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 128 5777: 2.Psychology is the study of the mind, human behavior, feelings and non humans. lt studies the conscious and non conscious phenomena, that includes thoughts and feelings especially those that affect behavior in a given context. It can also be called a science because it uses scientific methods to gather information and analyze it for instance stating the question, offering a theory and constructing rigorous laboratory and field experiments to test the  hypothesis(deductive reasoning) .Psychology also uses positivism (quantitative research ) to get information. Psychology makes use of  objectivity to get data  thus it can be called a science.  Research plays a pivotal role as it serves psychology with explanations , predictions and methods to control human behavior. lt also brings evidence based strategies that solve problems and improve lives, not only that but also the understanding of human behavior and the assessment of diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders for instance bipolar,depression and PTSD.
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 128 5777: 3.ld is the impulsive part of the personality that is driven by pleasure and repulsed by pain.  lt is the instinctual, biological component of a person.lt is  driven by desires, the desire to be rich  because it brings pleasure (luxury life),  repulsed by pain   in form of disappointments, heartbreaks. An  ego is a component of personality that is represented by our conscious decision making process. It is characterized by sense of self esteem,  superiority, feeling and thinking that distinguishes selves from others,  pride and self worth. lt is the mediator, as it is the conscious part of the personality that mediates between the id and  superego. A superego, part of the self that is a self critical conscience, reflecting social standards learned from parents and teachers. One believes the superego is built through primary socialization where there is moral uprightness being instilled into  an individual. The superego is judgemental and is the moral correct part of the personality that drives perfectionistic standards of behavior towards the id to curb unacceptable desires. The good feeling one has after doing something good and also guilt for doing something wrong. lt works with the conscience to  reflect social standards eg (do not steal)
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 128 5777: 4. Stigma is a symbol of disgrace. Talking about the mental health is characterized by stigma because people have prejudiced beliefs about  it. People tend to believe that those suffering from mental diseases (PTSP, OCD) are unfit. This belief  has led to stigmatization   this is so because of the the misleading media representation where people with mental health problems are portrayed as barbaric, villains and deviant. This has perpetuated the stigma about mental health. Mental health is also caused by ignorance and misinformation where members of the society stigmatize those with mental health issues without any knowledge of the impact the stigma does on the victims. There has been misinformation about mental health were mental health is juxtapositioned with madness and moral deficiency. One believes that education and awareness campaigns about the mental health will clear off the prejudiced tendency people have towards mental health. The positive publicity of mental health on social media will also help curb stigmatization. This can be done through TV shows. Creation of focus groups where people get to talk about their mental health openly will devote mental health to acceptance in the society.
24/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 128 5777: 5.Early experiences rule us for life more especially because it is the foundation for future learning. Early experiences have an impact on the development of the brain's architecture. The function of one's brain is determined by their early experience for instance violent people have a history of violence during their early experiences. Through primary socialization human behavior is shaped and people tend to develop their superego from early experiences in life. Early experiences are credited for ruling us for life because that is were the most rapid development of the personality, id, ego etc takes place. Ones character traits are credited to early experiences with family, friends during childhood thus the saying (charity begins at home). The home symbolises the foundation and in this instance is the early experiences. Mental health problems like PTSD, anxiety, depression are as a result of early experiences even though they catch up with us later in life. For instance a child from an abusive home is bound to have post traumatic stress disorder in the nearer future because that was the early experience and it leaves a mark and sometimes shapes who we will be in the future

24/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
24/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 128 5777: yes we can proceed
24/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Psychology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Yes it is accurate
24/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Good evening how are you
25/11/23, 10:18 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and Tadiwanashe!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 128 5777: Yes please, thank you
25/11/23, 11:05 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Psychology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 128 5777: yes it is accurate
25/11/23, 11:20 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
25/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 128 5777: yes
25/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 128 5777: yes it is impossible
25/11/23, 11:35 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 128 5777: ohh that is great
25/11/23, 11:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/11/23, 11:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 128 5777: How much time does one has to take making such a critical decision
25/11/23, 11:39 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 128 5777: yes we are
25/11/23, 12:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
25/11/23, 12:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/11/23, 12:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 128 5777: ohhh okay
25/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 128 5777: the registration fee has a deadline, ouch
25/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 128 5777: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 128 5777: yes l have
25/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Can l please have clarity.
After receiving offer letters from universities how long does one have to decide which university to choose, 

Does the deadline apply after or before deciding which university to choose
25/11/23, 1:06 pm - +27 63 079 6668: I'm now lost on the fees now all along we bn told fees can b 1000 to 2000 per annum inclusive  everything  now I see a breakdown  of food  n fees how is it working  now
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Good evening
27/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tadiwanashe.

How are you doing today?
27/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Well sir and you
27/11/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm doing great, thank you for asking. Now, regarding our concerns, everything will be addressed as we proceed with the session. With that said, shall we now proceed with today's session?
27/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 128 5777: yes
27/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
27/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
27/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 128 5777: The 2800 is for?
27/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 128 5777: noted
27/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
27/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
27/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
27/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 128 5777: okay okay
27/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 128 5777: noted
27/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/11/23, 9:28 pm - +27 63 079 6668: Meaning  as it stands  we need to pay the 150 balance  from last time   n pay the 750  n in JANUARY  we have to pay  the 1050 again  b4  anything  else
27/11/23, 9:29 pm - +27 63 079 6668: Meaning  total 1950 is needed  btwn now n JANUARY
27/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Ahhh noh that's not the case
27/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:00 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students.

18/12/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/12/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/12/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/12/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
18/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Yes l am through
18/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 128 5777: This is pleasing
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 128 5777: What of those that await their A level results.
18/12/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am coming to that as well.
18/12/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/12/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*
18/12/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
18/12/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Ohh thst is interesting
18/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 128 5777: That is great, looks like EDOOFA puts their students first at all times which is interesting
18/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Okay sir
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/12/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Amazing!
18/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 128 5777: yes it does
18/12/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
18/12/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 128 5777: yes, it's quite interesting,
18/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Is it the same amount that is to be paid in parts within a period of 30 - 45days
18/12/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: yes it is
18/12/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 128 5777: ohh interesting much, am delighted that they give us time to get the money ready
18/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 30 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Not really it is quite clear
18/12/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for connecting with me today. As my available hours are coming to and end let us connect tomorrow to further continue with the session. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
18/12/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 128 5777: Thank you sir have a blessed night
