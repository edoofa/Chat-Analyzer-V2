I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.

18/10/23, 1:11 pm - +27 76 328 0758: Afternoon thanks for getting to us .Am facing serious problems here so was suggesting that we stop the process for the boy to come next year maybe delay it with a year.

I hope you've had a great day. I understand that you are facing challenges, and you are considering delaying the process for the boy to come next year. That is a reasonable option if it's in the best interest of your family and the student. I would like you to participate more actively in our session because there are certain benefits that I would be happy to provide you with more insights on, so you don't miss out on these opportunities.
