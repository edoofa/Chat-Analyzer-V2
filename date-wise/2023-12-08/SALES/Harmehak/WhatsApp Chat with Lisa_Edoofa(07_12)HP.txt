You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
07/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 678 7486: Oky I understand it is a very good scholarship program indeed
07/12/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 678 7486: Yes yes that's true sir
07/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak.

07/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Lisa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Dzivarasekwa high 2 charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
