1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?

07/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa program offers  50 to 100 percent scholarships. Edoofa is not like a charity and it is rare to find a 100 percent scholarship. Edoofa may help students to have access to higher education since nowadays tertiary education is more dearer
07/12/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

What else did you learn?
07/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa offers scholarships for all countries in the world especially for African nations. Edoofa will help students to achieve their goals and start new life abroad
07/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa also have access to many institutions such as colleges, universities and schools in India. The expenses for international students were very high but due to the contribution of the Edoofa it is now affordable
07/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 038 1173: Tuition fees can be reduced by doing tasks and projects. A student cannot work and earn. The living expenses after scholarships is 2000-3000 per annum. Edoofa does not offer scholarships to students considering that they are poor or their family backgrounds but they offer scholarships to well behaved students who always participate marvellously
07/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 038 1173: Edoofa also helps students to apply for their visas through the embassy and the Indian ministry of home affairs. A student should have to pay for the visa at the Indian embassy.
07/12/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed the document, Munyaradzi.

So did you happen to discuss everything with your parents?
07/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I have read everything for them
07/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

So I believe you understand the following too?
07/12/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes I have understood
07/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: That's good,

So are they willing to support you financially, Munyaradzi?
07/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 038 1173: Yes they said they are willing
07/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
07/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
07/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 038 1173: I'm confident
07/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
07/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Engineering ?

07/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 038 1173: When I was young I used to construct homemade bridges and electric trains so I have discovered that I should carry on with my task
07/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Well that's great,

However did you happen to research about the requirements for Engineering, Munyaradzi?
07/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 038 1173: I was fully motivated to be an engineer when I had stories of collapsed bridges which destroyed many peoples lives
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 038 1173: Yes there is need for A level physics but unfortunately I didn't have a chance to scoop that combination at A level
07/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Very correct.
07/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: I can see in your student file that you opted for Business Administration,

May I know more regarding the same?
07/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 038 1173: Business Administration is now in my veins since I have been doing Business studies at A level
