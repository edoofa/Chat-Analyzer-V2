07/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
07/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 656 5096: Can I ask what is it makes a student worthy of a presidential scholarship
07/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 656 5096: And do arts students have access to 100 % scholarships
07/12/23, 10:11 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a Presidential Scholarship?
07/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 656 5096: From my own understanding it is a scholarship that covers full cost of  tuition,fees and accomodation
07/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
07/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 656 5096: Okay thank you very much Ms Harmehak
07/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 656 5096: Now I understand
07/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 656 5096: That Edoofa also make education affordable
07/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Yes please
07/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
07/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 656 5096: Ms Harmehak can you please explain further on merits
07/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 656 5096: And what are the extra curricular activities

07/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 656 5096: Yes
07/12/23, 11:15 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Sharmaine, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Mutare Girls high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 656 5096: My name is Sharmaine Olline Mabvuu, I'm seventeen years old, born and bred in Zimbabwe. I am an art student at Mutare girls high paying 100 USD per term.I wish to study law in the justice sector but I'm still at cahoots with myself whether I should study law or real estate agency , trying to figure out which job would be worker friendly and also considering that I'm a young lady who will grow up to be a mother one day . I'm a good debater and for the past years I've managed to walk away with certificates and medals in competitions which include HIDC, SECTA and ORATE so I can proudly say public speaking is my strength although I have weaknesses in the social field, I'm an introvert and more of a closeted lady. I enjoy reading novels and listening to music during my spare time and also writing poetry because I believe that life itself is a work of Art. I have an older brother studying chemical engineering at Midlands state university after he had accomplished 15 points in mathematics, physics and chemistry at Hartzerll high , My father works for ZESA as a civil contractor. I'm a very dedicated and hard working student driven by my aspirations, hopes and dreams and I'm hoping Edoofa can be my road to success.
07/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Sharmaine, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know more about your parents?
07/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 656 5096: My father works for ZESA and he wrote his o level exams at Mt selinda and studied civil engineering at Harare polytechnic college, my mother was a pharmacist
07/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Thank you 🤝
07/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: I am sorry for your loss, Sharmaine.
07/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Thank you very much
07/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: So Sharmaine, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 656 5096: I believe it's a life changing decision indeed
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
07/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 656 5096: I am very it has always been my dream since the start of high school to study abroad. I believe that you have to be willing to get out of your cormfort zone to reach your full potential <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Sharmaine, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
07/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Yes they are I have told them and they said there'd be willing to support me if it's affordable
07/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I understand, Sharmaine
07/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 656 5096: Yes I am and I promise to deliver the best
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 656 5096: This term I managed to get 11 points
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 656 5096: And I believe next year I will improve
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: That's great
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, that's the spirit

07/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 656 5096: <Media omitted>
