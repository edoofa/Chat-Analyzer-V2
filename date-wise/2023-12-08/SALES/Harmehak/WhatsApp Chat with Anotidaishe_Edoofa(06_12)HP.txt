07/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

07/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: It's great to know that you found the information helpful, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Anotidaishe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD SCHOOL charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 365 0358: As you know, my name is Anotidaishe. I’m an 18 year old boy who did his primary education at Highlands primary school, where I played hockey in the first team since grade 3. I played hockey for 7 years then stopped because ofthe pandemic, I look forward to resume playing hockey in January 2024. I was enrolled at Goromonzi high school in Mashonaland East where I played tennis as a second sport. I became interested in Architecture and started doing Building, technology and design as one of my major subjects and I was one of the top students. I passed 10 Ordinary level subjects and later decided to do arts subjects because had developed more interest in them as time unfolded. Upon deciding to do arts subjects I changed my career path and decided that I want to do social work or anything related to humanitarian aid. I did my Advanced level education at Westminster International School where I studied History, Sociology and Literature in English . I was also the top student in my literature class. I also have good records with all three schools’ teaching staff and extracurricular departments.

The school fees at Westminster International was  $1200 USD 

As for my family, my mother recently left her job as a nurse to work full time in business marketing, which she had started as a side project in 2004. She has an undergraduate marketing degree, and is about to write her final exam for her digital marketing degree. My father is a Car Salesman and also serves as the driver of the car courier as a hobbie, he studied sciences up to A level and decided to follow his father’s footsteps who had interest in cars. I have two younger brothers, one aged 14 and the other aged 10

07/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Anotidaishe, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your interests in both sports and academics, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 365 0358: Are there any specific requirements or qualifications need to get a scholarship?
07/12/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: We shall discuss everything in detail as we proceed ahead with the discussion.
07/12/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Well Anotidaishe now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 365 0358: I believe tertiary education fosters growth and studying abroad would be a change for development of exposure in an individual and is a doorway for cultural diversity and cohesion.

And I do believe that it’s a life changing decision.
07/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Anotidaishe.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
07/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 365 0358: Yes, I’m prepared for life abroad.
07/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Anotidaishe, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
07/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 365 0358: My family is fully aware of this decision and they are willing to support me both mentally and financially.
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
