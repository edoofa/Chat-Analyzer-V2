We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

07/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Geology and bachelors in Geography are two related fields of study. Both disciplines focus on the study of the physical features of Earth, such as its landforms, soils, rocks, and other materials, as well as its atmosphere and oceans.

Geologists and Geographers both use maps and other geographical tools to study Earth's physical features. Geologists use maps to identify different types of rocks, soils, and other materials that are found in a particular area. Geographers use maps to identify landforms, population distributions, and other features of a particular region.

Both Geology and Geography involve the study of Earth's physical features in the context of the environment. Geologists focus on the physical processes that shape Earth's features, while Geographers focus on the interplay between physical features and human activities.

Both disciplines make use of a variety of research methods. Geologists collect and analyze samples of rocks, soils, and other materials to gain insight into the physical processes that shape Earth's features. Geographers collect and analyze data related to population distributions, land use patterns, and other features of a particular region.

In conclusion, Geology and Geography are closely related fields of study. They both involve the study of Earth's physical features in the context of the environment. They both make use of a variety of research methods to gain insight into the processes that shape Earth's features.
