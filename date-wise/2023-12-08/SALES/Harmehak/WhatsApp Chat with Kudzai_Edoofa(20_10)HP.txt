22/10/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: Duly received and noted please, Mrs Sunga!
22/10/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

However we always encourage our students to give their best efforts and aim for great results.
22/10/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 346 1535: I appreciate
22/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 346 1535: What is the minimum grade per subject accepted for eligibility?
22/10/23, 10:08 am - Harmehak: 2 Advanced level passes has been the minimum requirements considering the education during after Covid please.
22/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 346 1535: Noted
22/10/23, 10:34 am - Harmehak: Mrs Sunga, may I know what exactly does Kunszai wishes to pursue for his higher education in India please?
22/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 346 1535: Computer Engineering or anything related to computers
22/10/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 346 1535: Plus he highlighted to me that he wants to do aviation as an option
22/10/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Mrs Sunga.

So did you or Kunszai ever happen to research about the requirements for engineering?
22/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 346 1535: Yes both of us did. We realised that math is required and we encouraged him to take it as a fourth subject. He is doing math during his extra time
22/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 346 1535: I am not sure if our research came out right. Please advise on this one
22/10/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: I understand please!
22/10/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/10/23, 11:53 am - Harmehak: Physics and Mathematics are a mandatory requirement even in Zimbabwe for engineering please.
22/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 346 1535: Noted. So with Kudzai's subjects now, what programs does he qualify for? What would you advise him to pursue?
22/10/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Considering his interests in Computer engineering and computers, he can opt for either of the following:

*Bachelors in Computer Application*
*Bachelor of science in Computer Science*

May I know which course shall I brief you about?
22/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Please brief me on bachelor of science in computer science
22/10/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Sure Mrs Sunga <This message was edited>

22/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 346 1535: This is quite interesting, eye opening. I really didn't know this. I appreciate this information
22/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 346 1535: So if say Kudzai does computer science there, are there job opportunities in India for him or he has to return home and look for a job?
22/10/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Sunga
22/10/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
22/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Great indeed
22/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Do these universities enrol students who have just completed AS level Cambridge or they want A level
22/10/23, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: Both are considered please!
22/10/23, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: There graduation matters more after completing University.
22/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 346 1535: I understand now
22/10/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Sunga!
22/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Yesterday you highlighted that this session is important in scholarship determination, would you mind to shed more light on the scholarships that you have
22/10/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Since we would be discussing Kunszai entire process as we proceed ahead I would brief you please.
22/10/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 346 1535: No, here we are not familiar with the costs
22/10/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
22/10/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/10/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/10/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/10/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Now I understand the costs. You are doing well in assisting both students and their parents. It is much appreciated
22/10/23, 3:59 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, Mrs Sunga, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
22/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 346 1535: This is quite good
22/10/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
22/10/23, 4:07 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Sunga, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
22/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 346 1535: This is very true about our situation here
22/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 346 1535: I do have a daughter in university here and surely these figures are true
22/10/23, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Mrs Sunga!

So I believe now you must be in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India along with providing an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program, isn't it?
22/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Now I can relate how you are making it affordable. I now appreaciate
22/10/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please!

Following would be the details regarding the Earn While You Learn Program.
22/10/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/10/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/10/23, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/10/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 346 1535: When do students work? During semester breaks or during free times in between semesters?
22/10/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: During their free time please.

They are alloted a dedicated mentor who accordingly prepare their schedule.

Students start with their Earn While You Learn Program from Zimbabwe itself.
22/10/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 346 1535: I get it
22/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/10/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 346 1535: This is encouraging and aspiring
22/10/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

Mrs Sunga, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. We would conclude in 20 minutes.
22/10/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Sunga, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/10/23, 5:03 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 346 1535: 5 applications would cost from $1500. It is a lot
22/10/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/10/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/10/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Sunga, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 346 1535: I would like you to clarify this. What do these rounds mean?
22/10/23, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
22/10/23, 5:21 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/10/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: The enrollment Fee that is $350 is paid in installments after Kunszai is found eligible for the program and has received an acceptance letter please.
22/10/23, 5:22 pm - Harmehak: I hope now you have a better clarity please?
22/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Yes. I now understand
22/10/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: I am glad.
22/10/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/10/23, 5:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/10/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 77 346 1535: How long does it take to complete the cycle?
22/10/23, 5:33 pm - Harmehak: For a student or parent who are active the entire cycle doesn't take more than 4-6 weeks please.
22/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Noted
22/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 346 1535: It is now a clear process from the image you have just shared.
22/10/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to hear that, Mrs Sunga
22/10/23, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/10/23, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/10/23, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
22/10/23, 5:44 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
22/10/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
22/10/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Lovely
22/10/23, 6:06 pm - Harmehak: Feel free to connect with Mrs Ruth, Mrs Sunga!
22/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 346 1535: I will get in touch with Ms Magwaza, thank you for the connection
22/10/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: You can also discuss with Mr Maganga at St Ignatius College, Mrs Sunga.
22/10/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
23/10/23, 11:22 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone @263772522933 @263773461535 @263777670531 

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
23/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 346 1535: I am glad to know you and be connected with you. Yes we can proceed now
23/10/23, 12:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
23/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 346 1535: It went very well. All my questions were answered, am satisfied
23/10/23, 1:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
23/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 346 1535: We are still to talk to her. Hopefully we will get in touch with her by end of day today
23/10/23, 2:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
23/10/23, 2:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?
23/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 346 1535: I have no questions yet
23/10/23, 4:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: , I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!!
23/10/23, 4:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 1:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days
25/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Noted
25/10/23, 2:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So as family are you ready for the same ?
25/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 346 1535: We are ready
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 3:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 30th or 31th October 2023 for $200 and the  30th or 31th of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the  30th or 31th of October 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
25/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Option 1 works out well for us given the time frames
25/10/23, 3:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer this using voice notes ?
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 346 1535: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 4:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263773461535 since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Kunszai's application. 

Shall I get you the slots for tomorrow?
25/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Yes please, tomorrow is fine by me

30/10/23, 11:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: That is great @263773461535, so as of now would you like to ask anything from the Letter of Acceptance please?
30/10/23, 12:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are we connected @263773461535?
30/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Yes we are
30/10/23, 12:13 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Would you like to ask anything from the Letter of Acceptance please?
30/10/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 346 1535: First name of student is not spelt right. It is supposed to be KUDZAI.
30/10/23, 12:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The moment I received the results @263773461535, I did share about this clerical error with the Academic Board, they mentioned that by 12am CAT you would received the revised Letter of Acceptance today please!
30/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 346 1535: The acceptance letter is clear. I have understood its contents
30/10/23, 12:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright @263773461535 so as of now apart from the clerical error in Kudzai's name is there anything else you would like to ask please?
30/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 346 1535: I have no questions at the moment
30/10/23, 12:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright please, so @263773461535 as you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

Which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
30/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 346 1535: Option to deposit associate's account
30/10/23, 12:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me brief you about this mode in depth please!
30/10/23, 12:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263773461535 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
30/10/23, 12:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

31/10/23, 9:44 am - Sahil Edoofa: While I do understand that the deadline is of 6th November, the key benefit your child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of October 2023. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.
31/10/23, 10:00 am - Sahil Edoofa: It would be much more beneficial for Kudzai incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st October which would be today.
31/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 346 1535: I would like the process to start early too. And as such I am hoping that by the end of today I will have deposited 200 usd towards the enrollment. I will show the proof of payment once done.

31/10/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 346 1535: What are the charges on the 200 usd? I do understand if I am paying 350 usd the charges are 44usd
31/10/23, 10:05 am - Sahil Edoofa: @263773461535 charges on $200 would be 12.5% which would be $25.
31/10/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 346 1535: Alright. So today I am making a payment of 225 usd
