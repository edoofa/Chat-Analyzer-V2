07/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 738 6311: thank you
07/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 738 6311: Yes , it is.
07/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Fergie, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Tafara 1 high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 738 6311: I am the firstborn child in a family of six children. I was raised in Tafara. For my primary education, I attended Mwanandishe Primary then Tafara 1 High School. Being the eldest child in my family I had an early sense of commitment that was to look after my siblings. My mother works as a teacher at Mwanandishe Primary School. Life has never been easy for my family in terms of finances especially when the school feels hiked to $180 from $90. After my father died in 2019 I was forced to learn in debt. Mashambanzou Care Trust chartered for my fees until I finished my ordinary level which I passed with flying colors.

Driven by an impoverished way of life, I had to carefully make financial calculations hence I discovered my passion for arithmetics. At the advanced level, I took science subjects that is mathematics, chemistry, and biology. Given the opportunity to attain academic studies, I want to be a veterinary scientist. I believe this scholarship will be a stepping stone for me to achieve my dream and bring honor to my family and community as well as transform their standard of living.
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: I am very sorry for your loss, Fergie.
07/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Thank you Ms. Harrmehak.
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Fergie, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
07/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Thank you.
07/12/23, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Well Fergie now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 738 6311: I think studying abroad will not offer me education and professional skills only, but life skills also. This will help me when it comes to social interactions with others social groups and it'll also be easier to access job opportunities .
07/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Okay, thank you Ms. Harmehak
