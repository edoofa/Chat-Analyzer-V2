I have learnt that Edoofa is a program of paramount importance that helps students to achieve their goals and improves their ways of living through affordable education programs even if they don't have enough resources.
Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?                    
I should be accepted into the Edoofa program because I want to fill my dreams which may be affected due to financial constrains.

07/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs.Patricia Chirongera, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Jesca, is that correct?
07/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 395 8654: Correct
07/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Jesca, also do tell me whether you learnt about Jesca’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
07/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 395 8654: I have learnt that Edoofa program is a Scholarship that aims to empower students from developing countries by providing them with access to quality education.  After I have interacted with Jesca who is a beneficiary of the Edoofa program I have learnt that it helps her with comprehensive support system which provides financial assistance, mentorship, career guidance and personal development support.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, I see you are well informed.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: But let me aslo brief you about the program.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 395 8654: Thank you so much for the briefing am greatful
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 395 8654: I as a parent it will be my pleasure if my child benefit from this program.
07/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 395 8654: Am sorry my child is in class doing his lessons until 1430hrs he will be available my apology
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Thank you for adding me in this group am Delight Ganyiwa. Am the one who is seeking for the enrollment of the Edoofa program. Its my pleasure to meet you here Mr Gurvinder, Mr Shubham and Mr Jyotishman.
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Pleasure to meet you too, Delight.
07/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Delight, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes I think i have what it takes.
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 880 5139: I'm sorry I was in a lesson when you created the group
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now Delight, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-
