30/11/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Chleolyn, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
30/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I'm currently studying my lower 6 at Chinhoyi High School which is located in Mashonaland Province of Zimbabwe.  I'm from a middle class family and both my parents are  civil servants.My mother is a police officer and my Father is an educational facilitator. Due to the deteriorating economy of my country, my parents' income is not enough to provide for us all . I have my elder sister who's  studying  her Bachelor's degree with Midlands State University and she's in her Second year. I also have a little brother who will be enrolled for form one in 2024.Due to my parents' income, sending us all to school has been a challenge and as a result , it has been my major reason for looking out for a schoolarship. If given the opportunity, l would like to study Medicine. Adapting to change has been my strength lately as well as   striving so hard in my academics to produce good results. Fear of failure has been my major weakness in my life.
Thank you 🙏
30/11/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer, Chleolyn.
30/11/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: So Chleolyn, could you kindly tell me how much *Chinhoyi High	Mash West* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
30/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Yes it will reduce the financial burden
30/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 73 259 8781: It has been my parents ever since .. as l said earlier, their income is not enough  so they engage in small scale farming every year and they get some additional finance from there . My mother as for the moment she took her leave days at work so that she can help my Father at the farm since we are already in the farming season.
30/11/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: And what is the fees Chleolyn?
30/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 73 259 8781: $200 per term .. inclusively with transport money it ranges around $280
30/11/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
30/11/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
30/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I am very much interested in science subjects and literally I'm so good at them . This got me thinking . .. Why can't l do something and make the world a better place? I would like to save lives as many people are dying everyday. This has been my motivation and my love for science subjects can be my greatest strength in learning medicine
30/11/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Honestly no one .and that's why I wish to be the first one
30/11/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

God Bless You!
30/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Thanks to you... Have a good time as well
01/12/23, 8:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 838 7489: Good morning to you all. My apologies for my daughter's absent online, she is currently at school collecting her report book and are closing today. She will join us soon . Thank you.
01/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Noted, can I know, when she will be available?
01/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 838 7489: At around 1300hrs
01/12/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Noted, I am scheduling Chleolyn at 1:00 PM CAT.
01/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 838 7489: Thank you sir
01/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 73 259 8781: Hello sir my apologies.  1:00 PM will be okay .I am now back from school
01/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Education can be truly a weapon to change the world .This is true since education can create opportunities for individuals to explore their dreams and aspirations resulting in the development of societies and the economy at large. Taking for instance, if the world lacks skilled  doctors and nurses, a lot of people were going to die each and everyday which means that  society development is undermined .Also it is through  education that people gain skills , knowledge and values which helps them to make effective decisions, thus development of societies and communities. However , to give only value to education as as a weapon to changing the world will be unjust since there are other factors which can contribute to the development of the world .  Agriculture can be essential in contributing  positively to changing the world .  How can one learn on a hungry stomach ?? This is completely impossible and that's why agriculture is also  crucial to changing the world positively .We get various goods from agriculture be it Milk , grain ,meat ... However from my understanding access to resources such as food is also essential for improving people's lives and creating a better world .
01/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: It is apreciatable Chleolyn that you took the time and share your understanding of the quote, you truly have understood the motive why I start the day with these quotes.
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let us continue the session.
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 73 259 8781: It's alright sir
01/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to bring to your notice that the Indian Education system is known to produce world-class doctors and engineers for the world, and as to set that standard high, studying Physics for Medicine is mandatory in India but I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
01/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I will have to research more on the courses  so that I make a decision on which course I can take
01/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I will hear from my parents as well so that we come to an undstanding together
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: So should I schedule for tomorrow?
01/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes that will be fine.
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
01/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Is it advisable that she undertakes physics   since she has good passes at O level
01/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Marambakuyana, even if she takes up physics as a subject, she would have to come to India to give NEET exam which is a national entrance exam for medicine aspirants, and if she is able to clear that exam which is very difficult, then only she would be able to get admission in Medicine in India, that is why I have suggested you the courses that follow the passion of your child, are less expensive, and also have a smaller duration than medicine.
02/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 73 259 8781: Good morning . How about Pharmacy ..do your that too at your institution?
02/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 73 259 8781: * Do you offer that program as well
02/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 73 259 8781: Typing error
02/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: Yes Chleolyn, we will offer you *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* but completing A-level Physics is a requirement for this to happen, so do you think you can do that?
02/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 73 259 8781: Maybe I will have to do Physics separately because I wasn't doing physics at school
02/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 73 259 8781: Will it be okay ??
02/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: Yes that will be fine.
02/12/23, 11:08 am - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*.

04/12/23, 8:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
04/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 71 838 7489: Morning to you too
04/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
04/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
04/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 73 259 8781: It is crucial to set goals that inspire and motivate you .A wise man once said ," A man with an aim is like a ship without a rudder "meaning that without a goal, it is easy to feel directionless and lost  .With a clear goal in mind , one can work towards something meaningful and rewarding.When l was doing O level ,l encounterd a lot of challenges that at some point,l thought of quitting  but because of my goals and dream of being a doctor , l kept on going  and l also knew that at the end of a dark tunnel there was light and also to reach the peak of a mountain l had to risk a fall.My specific and measurable  goals helped me to stay focused,stay on track and l also made some   progress. I stayed committed to my goals and l will continue doing so. l started doing study groups with my classmates and this helped me a lot . It is an important to set high goals that you can break into small manageable steps .This way it is easy to accomplish them .Goals are the ones that keep us going even though things  are not easy . Setting goals too low do not provide enough motivation to actually do them .Without goals, life would be meaningless and it would be  easy to become complacent.
04/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 73 259 8781: Yes l did
04/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Well said, Chleolyn.
04/12/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 73 259 8781: After five years of completing the course , l see myself working in a hospital continuing to develop my skills and expertise contributing to the growth , development and success of the organisation. I see myself working in a place where l can make a  difference, helping and saving patients lives and also l see myself as a graduate who has gained valuable experience and knowledge through internships and opportunities.l will be part of  medical professionals who are devoted to provide quality health care  to patients. The Edoofa Program can help me with mentorship and networking opportunities that can open doors and lead to new opportunities.The program can also support me financially thereby reducing the tuition cost , making it affordable to pursue higher education.lt can also help me build a strong starting point for success by providing the skills and knowledge to prosper in the medical field .The program will provide me with access to  quality education , support ,career guidance and the resources , l need to succeed and achieve my dreams.
04/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Chleolyn, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes
04/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Studying abroad , provides  an opportunity to experience a  different culture and learn a new language .lt also  creates an  opportunity to gain new academic and professional opportunities.It also provides the ability to gain new skills and also to learn solving problems in a different environment.Better education is also offered.l can gain new perspectives .The cost of education in my home country is too high and educational opportunities are limited as a result of lack of educational funding and also lack of access to educational resources.If l study abroad , l can interact with different communities around the world which can lead to an improved critical thinking, increased self- reflection and work opportunities.Lastly , l have a desire to explore the world
04/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Given the opportunity to study abroad through a schoolarship is a huge privilege and l would be grateful for the chance to learn and grow as a person .Inorder to improve the education system of my home country, l plan on sharing my experiences and learnings through presentations ,   creating events for educators , sharing resources with schools and also  creating a mentorship program to help connect students from my home country with mentors from my host country .Skills such as communication ,critical thinking,self independence , confidence ,adaptability that l might have developed ,can be shared through workshops.l can also share intercultural skills and knowledge such as understanding different educational systems and perspectives , that l would have gained,  through workshops also. Intercultural communication helps to promote tolerance and understanding between different cultures.To effectively communicate and promote my learnings from abroad , l would consider different communication chanels such as community events and social media.l would create social media campaigns , this way the education system of my home country is developed.Knowledge on different educational systems and practices, will   improve the quality of education in my home country .
04/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Chleolyn, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
04/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you agree?
04/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I  totally agree
04/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes it is
04/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
04/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

04/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Olk
04/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now Chleolyn, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 73 259 8781: No
04/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
04/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 73 259 8781: No , we are not .
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *B.Pharma* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
04/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 73 259 8781: olk
04/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Olk , noted
04/12/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes
04/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Chleolyn, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/12/23, 7:12 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

*“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/12/23, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Chleolyn, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
06/12/23, 7:49 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

06/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 838 7489: Yes
06/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 73 259 8781: Greetings everyone, l would like to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the network issue , am now online.
06/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

06/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
06/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 73 259 8781: Yes , l think so
06/12/23, 9:30 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Chleolyn, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 73 259 8781: olk , l understand
06/12/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/12/23, 9:42 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 838 7489: This is wonderful
06/12/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Marambakuyana, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Chleolyn for her higher education. <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 73 259 8781: It is
06/12/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 838 7489: Yes
06/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 838 7489: Yes I have discussed with them
06/12/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 838 7489: Yes sir
06/12/23, 10:56 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Marambakuyana as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 838 7489: Ok noted but is it guaranteed that after paying that amount you will be admitted at the University?
06/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 838 7489: Applying for more than one university will be very expensive
06/12/23, 12:00 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Marambakuyana, Can you please tell how much that will cost?
06/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 838 7489: $1500- $2250
06/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Marambakuyana, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Noted
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 838 7489: I do think so
06/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
06/12/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: However Mrs Marambakuyana, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Ok
06/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
06/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 838 7489: No
06/12/23, 12:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Marambakuyana, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in COUNTRY itself.
06/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes
06/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Yes
06/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
06/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
06/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
06/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Will you be told the program that you will be doing  before paying the registration fee or...??
06/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Chleolyn, have not we decided on *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*?
06/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I had a misunderstanding , but l understand now
06/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Noted thanx
06/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
06/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
06/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Olk, noted
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Ok noted. Thank you
07/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Hello @263732598781 @263718387489 .

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
07/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Are your parents active?
07/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Yes
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Please I hope you have been following the session so far
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?
07/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Good afternoon to you all
07/12/23, 12:28 pm - Gurvinder: Good afternoon.
07/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Please address the question, Mrs.Marambakuyana.
07/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 838 7489: O
07/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 838 7489: No
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline
07/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 838 7489: August/September 2024
07/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please read the question carefully and answer.
07/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Yes
07/12/23, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: And do you know that doing Physics is mandatory for the course that I have offered you, so are you ready to get Chleolyn Physics in A-level separately?
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 838 7489: If she goes for Physics in A level and have good passes I think she will opt for medicine
07/12/23, 1:18 pm - Gurvinder: But Mrs.Marambakuyana, She chose *B.Pharma* as the course she wanted to go ahead with.
07/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I asked about  Pharmacy since you said inorder to do medicine l had to do Physics . Pharmacy was my second option , and l  thought l could do it without physics.
07/12/23, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Well @263732598781 as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue

But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parents proud and also align with your passion. So If you do Physics seperately in A-level, you can go ahead with the courses like


1. Bachelors in  Pharmacy
2. Bachelors in Physiotherapy
3. Bachelors in Optometry
4. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology
5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics
6. Bachelor of Science in BioChemistry
7. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology
07/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Thank you for your time 🙏 but l want to fulfill my dream and aspiration of being a doctor
07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: If a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.
07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Gurvinder: Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.
07/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.
07/12/23, 1:39 pm - Gurvinder: Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
07/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Olk , let's say after l have obtained a degree in cardiology.How many years do have to study to get a degree in medicine??
07/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 73 259 8781: How much does it cost to study medicine in India??
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 73 259 8781: So technically speaking, l can study medicine that's if l have the required subjects, which are chem ,maths  and physics .
07/12/23, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Please you cannot pursue medicine, but you caan do a master's degree later on to work in a industry closely related to medicine
07/12/23, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: $15000 to $30000 USD after the scholarship since India is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices.
