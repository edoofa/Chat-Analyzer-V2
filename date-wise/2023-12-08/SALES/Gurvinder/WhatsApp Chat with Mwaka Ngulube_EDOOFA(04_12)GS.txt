04/12/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Mwaka, and Mrs.Harriet Hamikondo!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 8806769: Good afternoon Mr Singh
04/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs.Harriet Hamikond,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/12/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou noted Mr Gurvinder
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 5285124: Good Afternoon Mr. Gurvinder Singh
04/12/23, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mwaka, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Edwin, is that correct?
04/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes
04/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Edwin, also do tell me whether you learnt about Edwin’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - +260 97 5285124: I didnt really learn much about it from edwin. I also havent learnt of his journey and expirience yet
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright sir
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes, i would like that
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwaka, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/12/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes i do
04/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mwaka, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
04/12/23, 3:00 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou for the feedback this given about Edoofa
04/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: My pleasure.
04/12/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright...when do i have to submit it to you?
04/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Right now.
04/12/23, 3:06 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright
04/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
04/12/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 8806769: Yes we are. Mwaka is currently summarizing the questions asked. Thanks
04/12/23, 3:50 pm - +260 97 5285124: My name is Mwaka Ngulube. Im sixteen years old. I've lived in Zambia my whole life. Ive stayed with my mother most of my life. My father passed away when i was nine years old in the year 2016.
     I completed my primary education at a school called Libala Adventist School. I completed junior secondary education at a school called Terranova Boarding and Day school. I finally completed my senior secondary education from a school known as Kings Palace Academy.
    My highest education level is twelvth grade, am currently awaiting my results that are likely to be out by february.
    I would like to study computer engineering, because ive always dreamed of being a computer engineer since i was in eighth grade. Also, the world is evolving into an age of computers and eventually most jobs will be replaced by computers. Therefore, i would like to study computer engineering in order to make the world a better place and to satisfy the needs of people.
   My mother is an accounts assistant, my father passed away in the year 2016. My mothers highest education level is a diploma in Foundation In Accounting (FIA). She has been supporting me for my education since primary school. She will still continue to support me in my higher education abroad.
   The school i completed my secondary education from was Kings Palace Academy. It is located in central province. School fees there were k9700 per term for senior secondary.
04/12/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes we are. Sorry for the delay
04/12/23, 3:52 pm - +260 97 8806769: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 4:06 pm - +260 97 8806769: In a quest to uphold Mwakas curiosity of inventions which began at a tender age, I encouraged him to follow his dream. His passion to invent different things led him to participate in a Jets fair in lower secondary which saw him attain third place for inventing a wind turbine.
His quest to attain a scholarship and the determination he has exerted towards this has reminded me of the time shortly after the father's death when I sat him down before he went to boarding school. My words were" you will make it." You will even do better than your friends who have both parents. Follow your father's legacy and aim to even surpass him. Make him proud.
Am seeing that relentless spirit to achieve. To succeed against all odds.
Thankyou for this privilege. I know that once results are out and my son is accepted by your institution he will make a difference. Not an ordinary one but an extraordinary one.
04/12/23, 7:16 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
04/12/23, 8:14 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou for your time and effort. God Bless You too

05/12/23, 10:56 am - +260 97 5285124: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:57 am - +260 97 8806769: We are awaiting grade12 results likely to be out in late January 2024
05/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 11:44 am - +260 97 8806769: Mr Gurvinder does this entail that we can try the application process of a visa with your organisation, one final results are out.
05/12/23, 11:45 am - +260 97 8806769: Meant once final results are out
05/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
05/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Computer Application*
05/12/23, 12:19 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou for the positive feedback
05/12/23, 12:30 pm - +260 97 8806769: In line with your response am still curious. Does this entail that computer science course might not be available as part of the scholarship programmes. Thanks
05/12/23, 12:32 pm - +260 97 8806769: Pardon me. Meant to say Computer Engineering not Computer Science🙏🏻
05/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: When you mention the word engineering Mwaka, the need to have physics and chemistry as separate subjects from Science arises.
05/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: That is why I have given you an alternate course that aligns with your passion and interest. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 1:04 pm - +260 97 5285124: Ohh i see. So due to that, i cant study computer engineering?
05/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
05/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Should I brief you about *Bachelor of Computer Application*?
05/12/23, 1:29 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes please
05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Computer Application* course graduates have a variety of career options after completion of the course. Apart from pursuing higher study course such as MCA or any related course, students can secure a job in diverse areas such as software development, banks, ITES, government departments, Education, etc.

BCA, while primarily focused on software, can also encompass elements of business and management, preparing students for roles that require both technical and managerial skills.

Ultimately, both BCA and CSE degrees offer incredible opportunities for growth and success in the tech industry.
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou. Out of curiosity what are the other programmes enlisted under your organisation?
05/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo, I have given Mwaka the course that is aligned with his passion and his interest.
05/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou Mr Gurvinder, I appreciate your valuable input
05/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
05/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/12/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 8806769: Mwakas second option was Chemical engineering. In the event that this is offered by your organisation does it still meet the criteria of chemistry and physics not being combined if one is to be eligible for entry criteria
05/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 97 5285124: Well, i also have interests in civil engineering and chemical engineering. Do you offer courses in those?
05/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 97 8806769: The 2 advanced A levels passes are these equivalent to SAT
05/12/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes i am
05/12/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is the case, then I would have to offer a diploma in Chemical Engineering or Civil Engineering based on the O-level results which is not advisable.
05/12/23, 4:04 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou.
05/12/23, 4:06 pm - +260 97 8806769: Ok thankyou.  So does that mean if he sat for SAT exams and passes can he then be eligible for chemical or civil degree course scjolarship
05/12/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
05/12/23, 4:59 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright thanks. God bless you too🙏
05/12/23, 5:00 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou for your time and effort. We appreciate. God Bless You too

06/12/23, 8:49 am - +260 97 8806769: Assuming he passes his SAT exams can he then be eligible for Computer Engineering
06/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: Is he giving Physics and chemistry separately?
06/12/23, 9:26 am - +260 97 8806769: For SAT his only doing English and maths
At school physics and chemistry were combined
06/12/23, 9:32 am - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo, with this combination how can I offer engineering?
06/12/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: The course that I have offer you teaches computer programing that is in align with Mwaka's interest and also offers similar job opportunities.
06/12/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: Why are you not considering that?
06/12/23, 9:39 am - +260 97 8806769: We are learning Mr Gurvinder
06/12/23, 9:42 am - +260 97 8806769: Totally agreed.
06/12/23, 9:44 am - +260 97 8806769: You are right we can consider . It's just that it's a new thing to us and we want to be sure we get as much information as possible before we settle for that. Otherwise we consider you a Blessing
06/12/23, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: May I know that did you read the course brief?
06/12/23, 10:09 am - +260 97 8806769: Yes I did
06/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: And do you think it will help Mwaka?
06/12/23, 10:31 am - +260 97 8806769: Yes it will help. You know as a parent you want to ensure that your child pursues what they are passionate about and hopefully get employed
06/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: I understand, Mrs.Hamikondo.
06/12/23, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for Mwaka's career, however, can you please tell me why you want him to study abroad and not in your country?
06/12/23, 10:47 am - +260 97 8806769: I initially wanted him to study from my home country. However one holiday when he came back from school, he told me they had career masters who had come to their school advertising prospects of studying abroad. I think for him it opened up his mind to the fact that he could pursue studies even abroad and that he wasn't just tied to his home country
06/12/23, 10:50 am - +260 97 8806769: His zeal to study abroad made him go flat out finding out for himself online and physically from prospective organisations about scholarships. Not only that he got convinced a scholarship is feasible after he saw his cousin Eddy get picked for a scholarship in India. Before I knew it, Mwaka had applied for a scholarship with your organisation
06/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/12/23, 10:52 am - +260 97 8806769: I feel with the intelligence he possesses he will find his equals out there where selection is from a much wider scope and hence the competition will propel him to think outside the box
06/12/23, 10:53 am - +260 97 8806769: Yes am curious
06/12/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/12/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

06/12/23, 11:05 am - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou for these rich insights. No doubt India is the place to be. It's trending
06/12/23, 11:06 am - +260 97 5285124: Yeah, it really is
06/12/23, 11:07 am - +260 97 8806769: Mr Gurvinder one cardinal fact we left out.
Mwaka has an older sibling who will begin pursuing accounting studies at the Zambia centre for accountancy studies. This should've been in Mwakas introduction
06/12/23, 11:10 am - +260 97 8806769: And morals are somewhat still upheld even with escalating levels of technology and in the face of moral decay. Not that it's spared from what happens everywhere else in the world. That's the other reason I would opt for India
06/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
06/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: So now Mwaka, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/12/23, 12:01 pm - +260 97 5285124: So far, i dont have any questions. Thankyou for outlining all these details to me🙏
06/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 12:08 pm - +260 97 5285124: No
06/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 12:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 12:25 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou. This is helpful data
06/12/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 8806769: Item 1 says remaining tuition fees. Does that mean $2000 to $3000 is after a certain percentage of a scholarship is awarded
06/12/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Mrs.Hamikondo, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 12:38 pm - +260 97 8806769: Ok thankyou this is vital financial information
06/12/23, 12:39 pm - +260 97 8806769: So from this information I can deduce that you don't offer 100 percent scholarships
06/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo, I am giving you a general idea, the quantam of scholarship is not decided yet.
06/12/23, 12:42 pm - +260 97 8806769: Ok it's very clear. Thanks
06/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/12/23, 12:48 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes please🙏
06/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Mwaka, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/12/23, 12:55 pm - +260 97 5285124: So does that mean that all international students get to be part of the EWYL program?
06/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
06/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/12/23, 1:20 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*

06/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yeah i think it would
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - +260 97 5285124: Is it a must that those who are part of the EWYL program have to use the money they earn to pay for the remaining tution fees?
06/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Yes they can earn a major part of their fees.
06/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mwaka, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_ <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 5285124: You cant use the money for any personal  use?
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: No, that is not possible.
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/12/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes, it actually is
06/12/23, 3:50 pm - Gurvinder: Mwaka, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
06/12/23, 4:09 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yeah, personally i think edoofa is a really good program and i would like to be part of it
06/12/23, 7:13 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
06/12/23, 7:38 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou. God Bless You too
07/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
07/12/23, 9:53 am - +260 97 8806769: Goodmorning
07/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
07/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs.Hamikondo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education. <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 10:26 am - +260 97 8806769: Mr Gurvinder, as Mwakas mum am the one to pay his school expenses.
07/12/23, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
07/12/23, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans for Mwaka in depth?
07/12/23, 10:29 am - +260 97 8806769: Yes I have but not really in depth
07/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
07/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/12/23, 10:36 am - +260 97 8806769: Yes
07/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/12/23, 12:25 pm - +260 97 8806769: Maximum is k10350 in my Zambian currency
07/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 97 8806769: K51750 for 5
07/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs.Hamikondo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/12/23, 1:33 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou. But right now I will not be able to manage
07/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 8806769: It's a very flexible mode of payment it's just that I've been caught off guard. Otherwise I appreciate your input. You're an excellent Marketer. Keep up the good work
07/12/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: As a Senior Counsellor at the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I am here to offer you comprehensive support in planning for your child's education and guide you through the details of our scholarship program. We understand that ensuring your child receives a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for Shaloam's brighter future, but for that we have to finish this counselling session and then we will discuss your case to find a solution. <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 2:24 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou
07/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: So should we continue?
07/12/23, 2:55 pm - +260 97 8806769: Yes
07/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/12/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 8806769: Am still new to the scholarship thing. Am learning and appreciating the process
07/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
07/12/23, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo, what students pay without Edoofa for 5 applications is around $2250, but just by enrolling with us you just have to pay a fraction of that, Isn't that amazing?
07/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 8806769: Welcome to the process, I wud say to myself. I had no idea the process but yes Edoofa seems fair
07/12/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/12/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
07/12/23, 3:19 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou it is loud and clear. However my assessment is that I will not manage even with your flexible payment plant. That said I would like to restart the process when am ready financially
07/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo, as I said I am here to offer you comprehensive support in planning for your child's education and guide you through the details of our scholarship program. We understand that ensuring your child receives a quality education is a significant financial commitment, and we are here to help you make informed decisions for Mwaka's brighter future, but for that we have to finish this counselling session and then we will discuss your case to find a solution.
07/12/23, 4:04 pm - +260 97 8806769: Well understood
07/12/23, 4:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
07/12/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 8806769: No
07/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mwaka, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
07/12/23, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
07/12/23, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
07/12/23, 5:22 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/12/23, 5:25 pm - +260 97 8806769: Yes we are
07/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
07/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
07/12/23, 5:25 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
07/12/23, 5:33 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - +260 97 8806769: Mr Gurvinder I appreciate all this info. My honest question to you is: having mentioned that we might not manage with application fee you're still not derailed from going ahead with counselling. Assuming you walk us through all these steps and we still fail to pay, won't that be a frustrating process for you
07/12/23, 5:39 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Hamikondo, guiding a parent to his/her child's better future is my job, I have understood the fact that you may not be able to pay the full fees now as you are facing some financial issues, but helping you plan for this, and going through with the counselling session is the only way I can talk to the financial board and find a solution for you, and by answering my last question, the counselling session ends, so I would appreciate that if you answer it as my working hours were over already at 4:30PM. <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 5:48 pm - Gurvinder: Please address @260978806769 .
07/12/23, 5:57 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou Mr Gurvinder for your resilience
Before Mwaka came to your site, we began a scholarship program under Zisd where we paid similar fees like Edoofa is asking. Little did we know that this scholarship process if one enrols have an application fee which is mandatory, attached to them
Like I mentioned earlier it's a learning process for us. It's the very first time we are doing this.
Perhaps for now since we've already invested with zisd, I apologize that we were not privy to the financial aspect that comes with Edoofa. Had we known before we applied with Zisd, we would definately have straight away opted to sail along with your organisation. I hope you understand my position clearer
07/12/23, 8:00 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
