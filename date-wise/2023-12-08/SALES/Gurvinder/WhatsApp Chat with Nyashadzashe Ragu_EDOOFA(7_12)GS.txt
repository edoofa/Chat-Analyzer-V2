What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? Edoofa is a good program that provides Scholarships to African students who are willing to study in India

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
I am an energetic, patient, hardworking and reliable individual who is eager to learn and very passionate in SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. I am also concerned about my future i.e how will my life be if I my dreams do not come true, therefore am looking for financial assistance and also willing to study in India as it is one of the most developing countries in technology. Thank You

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
