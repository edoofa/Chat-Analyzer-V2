Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
01/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 043 2632: Greetings,may you shed more light on the Edoofa Scholarship Program

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

01/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA.

03/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I hope that the results you are sharing are true, so I am moving ahead with our session. In case the information you share is found out to be incorrect then your application status is affected by it.
And also, although we are progressing ahead with your consent, but I want you to arrange the picture of your result as soon as possible,  Ok?
03/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok i will
03/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Natalie, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
03/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 085 5216: No i did't research
03/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: If you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
03/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
03/11/23, 4:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as the majority of the time, Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
03/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok so i should have how many points on my finals so as to persue this
03/11/23, 4:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
03/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok thank you thank you.I will achieve much better
03/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
04/11/23, 8:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Natalie, Mr and Mrs Ruziwa @263780855216 @263780432632 @263776000999, How are you?

04/11/23, 9:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: So did you manage to research regarding the courses that I shared yesterday?
04/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 085 5216: Ok i want to ask first ..is there any chance that i can be a medical doctor any of those courses
04/11/23, 10:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: If a student does not have the required subjects to study medicine in India, there are alternative options available in the field of healthcare. Pursuing a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology or Cardiovascular Technology can be a viable route to eventually pursuing a major in medicine.
04/11/23, 10:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: Medical Laboratory Technology involves the analysis of body fluids and tissues to diagnose diseases and aid in treatment. It requires a strong foundation in science and mathematics and offers courses in biochemistry, microbiology, haematology, and immunology, among others. Students with a degree in Medical Laboratory Technology can work in labs, hospitals, and clinics, and can gain valuable experience in the field of medicine.
04/11/23, 10:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: Cardiovascular Technology involves the use of non-invasive procedures to diagnose and treat heart and blood vessel disorders. This field requires a strong foundation in biology and anatomy and offers courses in electrocardiography, echocardiography, and vascular technology. Students with a degree in Cardiovascular Technology can work in hospitals and clinics and can gain valuable experience in the field of cardiology.
04/11/23, 10:10 am - Shubham Madhwal: Both Medical Laboratory Technology and Cardiovascular Technology can provide students with a solid foundation in the healthcare field and valuable experience in the medical industry. Pursuing a major in medicine after obtaining a degree in one of these fields is possible, and students can gain an advantage over their peers by having a more diverse skill set and experience in the field. It is important for parents to encourage their children to explore alternative options in the field of healthcare if they are unable to pursue a major in medicine initially.
04/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 085 5216: Ok thank you

22/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 78 043 2632: Yes sir
22/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you tell me If you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams? *Answer in Detail*
22/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 085 5216: I think 5 years after the programme I will be an expert in everything I would have taught and as you said I have a greater chance to have the job abroad so I think the carrier I will get will be much easier especially the medicine thing
22/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
22/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Yes iam more than willing to work very hard
22/11/23, 3:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
22/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Natalie, Mr and Mrs Ruziwa @263780855216 @263780432632 @263776000999, How are you?

23/11/23, 12:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
23/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 78 085 5216: What are the reasons then
23/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

6. *Cultural Diversity and Vibrant Campus Life:* India's educational institutions celebrate cultural diversity, providing students with a multicultural environment.

23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok sir
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 085 5216: It has always been my dream and I believe that if I study in abroad then I can achieve better in life
23/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 085 5216: I haven't applied to any university yet
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 085 5216: I think it's 3000
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok so how can I know that I am selected
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 085 5216: After being selected is it you who will find the university for me there
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok so is there any chance that I can be chosen
23/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Well Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount based on the following points.

1. Academic 
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Work Experience (if any)
6. Recommendation from Edoofa.
23/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok then
23/11/23, 5:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

29/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Hello sir how are you

29/11/23, 3:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Shall I now update you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Yes you can
29/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
29/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
29/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok sir I think it is a great programme
29/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/11/23, 3:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Yeah the ideas of the program are just great..and is what I was really looking for all along
29/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok firsly we do the counselling session then secondly the egibility check test and interview after that then there is acceptance into edoofas programme then enrollment into the programme after this then there is admission process into the Edoofa pragramme and finally admission letter and visa
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
29/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 085 5216: Ok thank you for the information sir
29/11/23, 5:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
29/11/23, 5:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth. 


2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.
