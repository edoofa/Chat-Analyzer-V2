13/10/23, 10:40 am - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
13/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 577 1256: That is what I am striving for
13/10/23, 10:45 am - Tushti: Alright so Rutendo, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination
2. The course you would like to study and why
3. What do your parents do (their profession)
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far
7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad
8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $?
13/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 577 1256: My name is Rutendo Chiguri born on the 23rd of April 2006.l am the third born in a family of 4 children that is two girls and two boys.I am single still dedicated to do my studies. My opinion is to study towards achieving my goal. I am a team player and my weakness is that l hate being a failure.

 I completed my Ordinary level in 2022 where l managed to come up with 11 subjects, Mathematics, English and Sciences inclusive. Currently, l am doing form 5 at Shalom Academy in Murewa- Zimbabwe. My subject combination are as follows; Mathematics, Economics and Business Studies. If all goes well according to my plans, l am intending to study towards engineering or Sciences.

My father is a Human Resources Officer in the Ministry of Health and Child Care in Zimbabwe and he is the bread winner of the family. My mother is just a house wife. My father' s highest qualification is Higher National Diploma in Human Resources which is equivalent to first degree.
Since as l said earlier on that we are a family of 4 children, father and mother, I have found it prudent enough to apply for this Scholarship as l have no one who will finance my studies abroad if given the chance. However, my father will chip in. Currently he is managing to pay $400.00 per term.
13/10/23, 11:29 am - Tushti: Thank you so much for your introduction, Rutendo!
13/10/23, 11:30 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?
13/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 577 1256: Very true.
13/10/23, 12:17 pm - Tushti: In that case, do you feel they are now financially prepared to help support your higher education abroad?
13/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 577 1256: Yes they can but l don't he can single handedly
13/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 577 1256: I don't think they manage single handedly
13/10/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: I see
13/10/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: Well, kindly share your O level results for evaluation. As your career counsellor, I shall try my level bets to find you a University where you are able to attain a high percentage of scholarship

13/10/23, 1:09 pm - Tushti: I shall need the picture, please
13/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 577 1256: Noted. I am having network challenge.

14/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 577 1256: Ok l understand but can l ask since I'm doing economics also is there any degree that is linked to that
14/10/23, 10:53 am - Tushti: You can do BA in Economics, however, the scope of employment is quite low for this course
14/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 577 1256: For me to persue the degree how many points do l need at A level
14/10/23, 11:02 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
14/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 577 1256: So there will be no difference between a person who have 15 points and the other has 2 points they will just do the same degree
14/10/23, 11:12 am - Tushti: The difference will be reflected in the quantum of scholarship given to a more meritorious student, @263775771256 !
14/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 577 1256: Thank you for clarification
14/10/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: So do you wish to continue with this course?
14/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 577 1256: Why not, it's a good course
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - Tushti: Great
14/10/23, 12:58 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
14/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 577 1256: If I'm provided with this great opportunity l see myself as someone great. I see myself as person with many job opportunities. I will have a variety of jobs to choose for examples l can be human resources manager, financial planning and wealth manger

16/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 577 1256: That is wonderful. That is why we chose India
16/10/23, 11:23 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
16/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 577 1256: We are not in clear picture. It will be very fruitful if you can share with us.
16/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: Sure @263775771256 , let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/10/23, 11:27 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/10/23, 11:27 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 11:27 am - Tushti: In simple words @263775771256 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/10/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 577 1256: Since we are considering her for 2025, if she passes her A-Level this is the time to prepare for her.
16/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: Exactly, and she can also benefit by starting to earn to self sponsor her degree
16/10/23, 11:43 am - Tushti: Would you like to know more about the EWYL Program?
16/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 577 1256: Yes. May share please.
16/10/23, 11:50 am - Tushti: @263775771256 , The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/10/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/10/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/10/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
16/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 577 1256: That is what we are looking for. With the help of you, l think she will do it.
16/10/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: Excellent
16/10/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/10/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 577 1256: Yes.
16/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: @263775771256 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 577 1256: The student end up paying between $1500-$2250.
16/10/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: Exactly @263775771256 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/10/23, 12:36 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 12:36 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 577 1256: The idea is fruitful
16/10/23, 12:40 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/10/23, 12:41 pm - Tushti: @263775771256 basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
16/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 577 1256: Ok
16/10/23, 12:41 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/10/23, 12:42 pm - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
16/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 577 1256: It is clear.
16/10/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
16/10/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 577 1256: I have to enquire from her school
16/10/23, 12:48 pm - Tushti: Alright @263775771256 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
16/10/23, 12:49 pm - Tushti: What do you need to enquire?
16/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 577 1256: About her performance currently.
16/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 577 1256: Ok
16/10/23, 1:06 pm - Tushti: Noted
16/10/23, 1:06 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
16/10/23, 1:06 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
16/10/23, 1:07 pm - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 577 1256: I have understood.
16/10/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/10/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/10/23, 1:10 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
16/10/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
16/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 577 1256: You can go ahead
16/10/23, 1:26 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/10/23, 1:26 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow  Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session.*
16/10/23, 1:26 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.
