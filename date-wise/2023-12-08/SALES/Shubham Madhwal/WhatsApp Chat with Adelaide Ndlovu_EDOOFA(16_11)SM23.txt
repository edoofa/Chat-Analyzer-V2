Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
18/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Yes l am willing to give my 200% hard work and take our the opportunities that come my way
18/11/23, 2:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

20/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 732 0873: Yes l am
20/11/23, 10:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263787320873 Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
20/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 732 0873: In my native country there are few universities full of corruption.
Studying in my native country is expensive compared to studying abroad.
I also feel that by studying abroad l will get more  exposure than studying in my native country
20/11/23, 10:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
20/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 732 0873: Yes l did a few research on foreign educational and am getting to understand it bit by bit
No l have never applied to any University abroad
20/11/23, 10:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
20/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 732 0873: No l don't have any knowledge about the cost of education and l would like to know about the cost
20/11/23, 11:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
20/11/23, 11:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
20/11/23, 11:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
20/11/23, 11:09 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 732 0873: Okay thank you sir have understood now about the costs of studying there
20/11/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 732 0873: The fees appear to be affordable bearing in mind the quality of the school and the earn to learn facility
20/11/23, 11:31 am - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
20/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 78 732 0873: Okay noted
Can u brief me about the earn while you learn program l want to have a better understanding about it
20/11/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/11/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/11/23, 11:47 am - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 732 0873: Thank you now l have a clear understanding about the EWYL Program
20/11/23, 11:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

20/11/23, 11:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 732 0873: l think the EWYL Program is a good program and it will benefit me

20/11/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Yes now l have realized how different you are and this is what l have been looking for regarding my international education
I have also seen how student are committed in the EWYL program and some are earning alot of scholarship credits
20/11/23, 12:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this  picture with me
20/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 732 0873: This picture is a cycle showing stages or processes that one go through when applying for the edoofa scholarship that is from stage  01 to stage 06
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
20/11/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Okay well understood but am a little bit confused as you are talking about the 2025 intake . On my application form my preferred year of administration is August 2024
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
20/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 732 0873: The Earn while you earn program
As it will reduce the cost of my education through scholarship credits and it will also prepare me for the real world through the skills that l will acquire from the program
20/11/23, 1:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 732 0873: My parents are the ones who are going to be helping and supporting me
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
20/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 732 0873: I have herd about the benefits that one can get, No you did not tell me about it
20/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
20/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Okay l can see how Edoofa has made it affordable to study abroad
20/11/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
20/11/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
20/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Noted
20/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
20/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
20/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
20/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Clearly understood
20/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,
20/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
20/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
20/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Okay so you mean l can choose any University l want to study given the list of universities that offer the course l want to study

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

The earn while you learn program is the one that has actually  motivated me. It is an employability  program that promotes the student to be more practical.  They are assigned real time online projects  to gain valuable work experience  and skills.
This is paid  in scholarship  credits  not in the form of cash.
The assi are done after schooling  hours.

7.May be elaborate  further

In case you do not follow these terms then *Adelaide's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
21/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *27th or 28th of November 2023* for $200 and the *27th or 28th of December 2023* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *27th or 28th of November 2023*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

21/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 991 8860: I have gone through  the FAQ document. 
I have dedused that Edoofa is a scholarship  that makes foreign  education accessible  and affordable by costing less compared  to local universities.  It is unlike a bursary or sponsorship  whose recruitment   is untraceable.
It is a scholarship  leading to meaningful  employment. 
At Edoofa 90% of applications  are done during  the exam final year. However, those with results can still apply. 
Applying at Edoofa is different from other universities  whose  primary  priority is only on impacting theories while they train employability. 
The enrollments fee is 350 payable within 7 days of place notification or 200 within  7 days then 150 after 30 days
21/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's great to hear @263779918860

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

SECTION 5
The Rwanda genocide occured between 7 April and 15 July in 1994 during the Rwanda Civil War. The Rwandans were brutally slaughtered by fellow citizens in the state- led genocide targeting the Tutsi ethnic group.

16 years following the Rwanda genocide survivors and their families continues to present with considering rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms in presoners accused of participation in the genocide as well as in their respective descendants. The data revealed a strong association between health problems and psychosocial factors such as social integration. Survivors were severely traumatized. Witnessing dead bodies lying out in open and in mass graves as well as experiences of fear, mistrust, and isolation.
Since the genocide approximately half of households have been headed by women, and many children grew up in child-headed households. After the genocide an outbreak of HIV swept throughout Rwanda due to Tutsi women who were raped during the genocide. Depression, post trauma stress disorder, anxiety and suicidal attempts are prevalent in Rwanda, with rates twice as high in women compared with man.
On the other hand Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding and developing since 1994 genocide. However, the small and landlocked country of nearly 14million people faces many challenges today, including inflation and higher unemployment.
Trough Rwanda AIDS orphans continue to face stigma in the schools and communities, the government has taken concrete steps to provide health services to children affected by HIV and AIDS. One of the biggest remaining challenges in the lack of accurate and complete data, particularly in hard to reach rural populations.

26/11/23, 8:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Everyone
26/11/23, 8:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: Excuse me for my delayed response I wasn't able to get back to you yesterday because of a family emergency.
26/11/23, 8:57 am - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you have checked your email now please?
26/11/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 991 8860: Morning,  yes I got the email
26/11/23, 8:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright please, I believe you must have gone through Adelaide's Letter of Acceptance as well?
26/11/23, 8:59 am - Shubham Madhwal: Would you like to ask anything from the Letter of Acceptance please?
26/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 991 8860: Yes I went through  the letter  I think it's clear.
26/11/23, 9:11 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright @263779918860 since, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
26/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 991 8860: I prefer  the second one to the associate  account
26/11/23, 9:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: Let me brief you about it in depth please!
26/11/23, 9:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: @263779918860 basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Shorwi's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Shorwi Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Shorwi inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.

Therefore the fee can also be paid through Hartzell High School Ex Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $395 ($350 + $45 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:- <This message was edited>

We will be depositing the amount tommorow
29/11/23, 11:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: You see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
29/11/23, 11:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
29/11/23, 11:33 am - +263 78 732 0873: Okay sir noted will try and do so today l have contacted Mr Kawadza
29/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So you will be completing the formalities today then?

30/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 732 0873: My dad hasn't received the money from the bank that is his salary
30/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So when does he usually recieve his salary?
30/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 732 0873: Any time from today since it is month end definitely by next week
30/11/23, 4:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please don't get me wrong but this is not the first time I am counseling any student. I personally have been helping students for the last 4 and a half years, and when I say that, with a little bit of my own experience, I personally feel there is actually something else which is the real concern over here!

Why don't you honestly share the real query with me, because there is surely something else which is a matter of concern right now? 

Don't be hesitant to share what is going on, because if you would not communicate, I am not a God who would understand what is going on in your mind without you even sharing it with me.
30/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 732 0873: I understand sir the issue we are having here is money as l mentioned my dad hasn't received his monthly salary for us to make the payment that has made us miss the deadline of the payment
30/11/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 732 0873: So l don't know wether we will be given some time or we have missed the opportunity

07/12/23, 12:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Mr Ndlovu, Why have you been inactive for  the past few days?
07/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 991 8860: Had a challenge, my phone was misbehaving
07/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So is the issue now resolved?
07/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 991 8860: Yes
07/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So Mr Ndlovu are you now prepared with Adedlaid's enrollment fees?
07/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 991 8860: Honestly  I really wished for  my child to be enrolled  hence am disappointed.  The company  problem has gone beyond our expectations.  The company has gone on to just pay us 25% of our dues which included bonus. From the amount  we have to make all ends meet .Am actually  hand tied such that I have even failed to explain that to my child
07/12/23, 2:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr Ndlovu, with all due respect I understand your situation, honestly there are certain instances in our life which are beyond our control, and infact we as human beings cannot plan for them as well.
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am sure you as her parents wouldn't have planned for this and I can understand that your priority shifted from Adelaide's Higher Education towards making all ends meet
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your child's academician, I am here to help you out, you see, in such instances, even the Board understands that the situation is beyond an applicant's control and if given a chance, they might be able to get hold of the situation with proper assistance and planning.
07/12/23, 2:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am sure you would like me to help you out with a financial plan which might help you in maintaining the priority of making all your ends meet while ensuring that it is not at the cost of Adelaide's bright future, isn't it?
07/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 991 8860: Amen,  you will be most welcome. It is my wish to have my children  have a bright future. True I I need your help
07/12/23, 2:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mr Ndlovu, firstly I would like to know if you are expecting to receive your remaining 75% from your employers?
07/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 991 8860: Yes we are expecting  though no date has been mentioned and how it will be paid (wholly  or in percentages)
07/12/23, 2:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So would you expect them to be paid within this month itself is that correct?
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 991 8860: Yes
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please, and after receiving the same will you be able to manage to complete the enrollment formalities?
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 991 8860: Yes, that is my wish
07/12/23, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So give me today's time to compile the details and make an application on your behalf to share with the Edoofa Academic Board to provide you with an extension to reserve Adelaide's scholarship seats
