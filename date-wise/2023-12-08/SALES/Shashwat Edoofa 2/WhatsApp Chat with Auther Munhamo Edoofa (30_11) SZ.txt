When I was in primary school ,and paying school fees was really a struggle.Even for my siblings,then Dzikwa Trust came to our aid as a family. They helped my elder sister and  I.and here I am. I passed my Ordinary levels with flying colours. I went on proceed into Advanced level this year and waiting for the results with all hope.Here's one way to answer: "My ambition is to be come an Engineer who is charismatic to change the livelihood of the people in the past growing technology but mostly those who are poor. I have worked hard  to achieve this goal by many sleepless nights and accompanied by prayer . I believe that if I keep working hard and stay focused, I can make my ambition a reality."
