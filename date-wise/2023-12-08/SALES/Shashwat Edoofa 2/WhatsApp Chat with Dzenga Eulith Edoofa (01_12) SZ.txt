06/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 320 6322: Eulith ' s dream career is becoming a medical doctor
06/12/23, 10:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since the Healthcare Sector encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues her?
06/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 320 6322: She aspires to be a surgeon
06/12/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mrs. Modina, could you please share why Eulith didn't pursue Physics in her A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
06/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 320 6322: Yeah it's really a very crucial subject but for most schools in this country you have to choose either physics or Biology so she chose Biology
06/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
06/12/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 320 6322: Thank you for the information , we failed to research well but it's ok ,we had a great time conversing and from our understanding your program is really good so l would like to say thank you for the session and l hope many people will benefit from this program
06/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Modina. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Eulith's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
06/12/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 320 6322: It's ok you can brief us about them
06/12/23, 8:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
06/12/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 320 6322: She is not sure yet so if she happens to be intrigued by one of the courses we will surely inform you
