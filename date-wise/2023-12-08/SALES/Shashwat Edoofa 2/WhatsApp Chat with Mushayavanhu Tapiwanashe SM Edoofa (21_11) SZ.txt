05/12/23, 9:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Tapiwanashe. Your co-operation is highly valued!
05/12/23, 9:19 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
05/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 754 9720: Thank you Sir for letting me know about this
05/12/23, 9:46 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colours, Tapiwanashe!

05/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 754 9720: My dream profession is being a Mining Engineer
05/12/23, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?
05/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 78 754 9720: That was a job of my dream,  l grew up admiring it .l am a kind of person that aspires to develop infrastructure of a country and l am very interested in such things like Engineering. The reason why the world is now developed is based on Engineering and Technology
05/12/23, 5:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tapiwanashe. May I know whether you are fascinated with technology, please?
