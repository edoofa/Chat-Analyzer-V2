07/12/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 845 8311: My apologies Sir l have been having network problems

So basically answering your question, l have received quite a number of motivations including better education facilities, l hear being offered abroad. I have also been motivated by a lot of relatives and friends who have studied abroad and have been prosperous in their lives. As evidence from my own cousin sister Ngakudzeishe Chindiya who studied in the UK is somewhere in life and l admire that. I also received a church testimony from a lady from Church on Sunday testifying that her daughter lately received her degree, after studying in India for her program. This motivated me behind studying abroad and also earning a degree abroad. 

I completed my A level this year November 2023
