I'm always working on improving my tendency to overthink, and I'm learning to take constructive criticism more gracefully. Overall, I'm confident that I can bring a lot to the table and that my strengths will help me succeed in my studies.I like playing games like chess and others.
I grew up with my parents and my mother passed away when I was 11 years and I started living with my grandmother. 
Now I am in U6. I'm doing Pure Mathematics, Statistics, Economics and Business studies. 
I would like to study Data Science. I want to study data science because I'm passionate about solving problems, I love working with data, and I'm interested in the intersection of technology and business. I believe data science can help businesses make better decisions and improve their operations.
My parents highest level of education is O level.  I do not have siblings. Now my uncle is one who is financially supporting me for my education. Like what I said above I don't have a fixed person to say that he is the one who will be supporting. I gt support from different people. 
Now my fee is 270 usd per term. I'm from Mashonaland  buy now I'm living in Masvingo province. 
I did my O level at Bumburwi Secondary Secondary school and now I'm doing my Advanced level at Chiredzi Gvt high school

07/12/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 971 6624: Ok
07/12/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Munashe, Please let me know  What specific financial plans or strategies have you and your parents put in place to support your tertiary education abroad?
07/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 971 6624: Truly speaking I'm the one who's willing to study abroad and had never discussed this with my parents before. I made Edoofa my choice because it is affordable and it can cover a higher percentage of tuition fee so it can be so acceptable to them
07/12/23, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Munashe, I do understand that!!

Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
07/12/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 971 6624: I think so
07/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 971 6624: I'm just assuming
