06/12/23, 9:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/12/23, 9:20 am - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabwe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries, and many others. In Manicaland, we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice, and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 



The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
           
*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
06/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 441 3438: Okay
06/12/23, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this.
06/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 441 3438: What are the points do you require
06/12/23, 10:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
06/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 441 3438: Yeah I'm confident
