06/12/23, 1:36 pm - +265 888 70 46 88: So I m a married woman to a pastor, a mother of 3 and Thokozani is our last born and the only daughter. 

I'm currently teaching at a secondary school .  I have first degree in education. I wanted to go further with my education but failed to do so because of insufficient finances . I want my child to attain higher education even if it means getting a doctorate degree because that's the only way to financial stability. This will later on help her be a useful citizen in the community and beyond. I  want her to have a name in the society.
06/12/23, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Sophie, It is good to know more about you, I am glad that you have a good vision for the career of your child and I believe it will come true if you child is found eligible for the program

06/12/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Ms. Sophie, Please let me share some details.
06/12/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/12/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Since our most recent trip to Malawi, we've been experiencing a huge rush of applications from the country as a result of how well we were able to communicate our testimony and commitment to giving students access to high-quality, affordable higher education while also delivering the most industry-accelerated and impactful curriculum. 

With more than 100 enrolled students from the country, we have connections with, several schools, educators, and reformers around Malawi, and a large number of students who have registered from institutions including Chaminade High, Willams Murray, Beautiful Gate, and others.

07/12/23, 9:02 am - +265 888 70 46 88: Good morning Ms. Pallika. 
I was so occupied yesterday  as I told you that I work . That's why I didn't come back to the assignment. It's not deliberate
07/12/23, 9:22 am - +265 888 70 46 88: However, I have a challenge or two of which I need your help. 

One is to do with question 7. 
I hear there's a 50_100% scholarship. What criteria do you use to come up with an offer of percentage to a student? 
For the remaining balance, is it the parent who squares? Suppose I fail to square (due to financial constraint as is the case presently with me), what will happen to my child ?
Is EWL open to every student?
07/12/23, 11:43 am - +265 888 70 46 88: Secondly, is it possible to change program right now? 
We chose a program ( International relations) because we didn't know that our choice (B.sc in Nutrition and Dietetics ) was there on the qr up untill we scanned.  What should we do? Please advise me.
07/12/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,
