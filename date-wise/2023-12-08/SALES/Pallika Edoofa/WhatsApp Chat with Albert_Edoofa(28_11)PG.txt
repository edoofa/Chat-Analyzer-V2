05/12/23, 3:17 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Okay
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Vida, Also,I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, Proceeding further, you might be aware of that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education destination

I would be interested to hear your perspective on why you believe studying in India and within the Indian Education System would be instrumental in achieving your dreams.
05/12/23, 3:37 pm - +233 20 431 1651: India is one  of the countries  with  rich  cultural  values  and of good  academic excellence in terms  of  pharmaceutical products  and IT.  In view  of this  l value  this  to areas of study  and  l believe  if my ward  is given  the opportunity  to do IT  he will  be one of the great scholars  in our time.
05/12/23, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mrs Vida, Let me share some information about India and various global leaders who are Indian alumni

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - +233 20 431 1651: No
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.



*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
