07/12/23, 12:07 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
07/12/23, 12:07 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
07/12/23, 12:07 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 12:07 pm - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*
07/12/23, 12:13 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Of course i am

07/12/23, 12:31 pm - Arshita: Good to know more about you. You have expressed yourself genuinely. 

Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of Medicine?
07/12/23, 12:31 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Not at all ,

07/12/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
07/12/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 12:44 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Not really, i only read about edoofa on your website
07/12/23, 12:47 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

07/12/23, 12:47 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done.

07/12/23, 3:15 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Yes i have
07/12/23, 3:15 pm - Arshita: As you mentioned that it is your desire to work in the Medical Field, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course as students need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with high grades to be eligible for Medicine and the process is regulated by the National Testing Agency under Ministry of Education. At the same time, I do acknowledge your strong aspirations to work closely in the Medical field, treat people in need and make a difference in the health sector, due to which you are eligible to pursue some of the best courses in the Medical field itself such as   

*1) Bachelor of Physiotherapy*
*2) Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*
*3) Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*
*4) Bachelor of Pharmacy*
*5) Bachelor of Optometry*
*6) Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular technology* etc

Do you want me to explain any of these courses to you?
07/12/23, 3:17 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: This is well noted, can you give today i should talk to my parents , they should guide me on the programmes you have listed?
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - Arshita: That is well noted. 

By when will you be able to provide a feedback?
07/12/23, 3:19 pm - +265 886 62 25 64: Tomorrow morning same time 11:30
07/12/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: Noted
