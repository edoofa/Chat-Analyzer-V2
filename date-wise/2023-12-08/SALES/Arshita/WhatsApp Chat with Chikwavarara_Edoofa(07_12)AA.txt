1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Flora?*
07/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 617 1945: 1. The fact that Edoofa has what we call the earn while you learn program which will enable me to gain experience in my field of specialty whilst learning theoretically.
Another factor is that I need to relieve my parents financially so that they may also cater for my 3younger sibling's educational needs as Education is now expensive in Zimbabwe nowadays and unlike the days I did my High school
07/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 617 1945: 2. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through your scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.
07/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
07/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
07/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years.

07/12/23, 12:19 pm - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity, aren't you?*
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 617 1945: I am
07/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Interesting
07/12/23, 12:31 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
07/12/23, 12:31 pm - Arshita: So now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. Please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:

*1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination*
*2. The course you would like to study and why?*

07/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 617 1945: I am Chikwavarara Betty T, a girl aged 18 who apart from being academically gifted is a soccer and softball player. I am a very collaborative lady who tolerates our differences as human beings. I'm also self motivated and goal driven in everything I do. My weakness is that I'm very fast when it comes to grabbing new concepts, methods and stuffs which is a very disadvantage to my partners but I try by all means to explain to them so that we are always on the same page.
Whilst relaxing I love playing darts and interacting with others as well as listening to music.

Betty is the first born of Mr  A Chikwavarara and Mrs O Viri in a family of 4 children. I was born in a small township of Mufakose(Harare) but I did my grade 1 to 4 in Trelawney, Zvimba South, Mashonaland West at my maternal home then came back in Mufakose in 2015 for my grade 5 upto A level where I'm living right now with my parents
07/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Currently I'm waiting for my A level results for Pure Mathematics, Physics and Computer science. Betty is opting for Aeronautics (Aerospace engineering) because I love challenges and I have discovered that only a few ladies go for it. Another reason is because of my need to add to the development of the aviation system of Zimbabwe which lacks expertise. 
My mother is a housewife with an O level certificate whilst My father is a primary school teacher although he holds a degree BSH in creative arts and design. 
After me comes a boy who is in form1 and then a girl who is in grade 3. Then lastly is a 2year old girl.
My whole 13 years of schooling were funded by my parents and provided I go and study abroad they will also thrive by all means to support me.
My per team fees ranged from $80 to $100 USD depending with the inflation rate. I recently studied at Mufakose 1 High school in Harare
07/12/23, 1:03 pm - Arshita: Harare is very close to us as our founders hosted Education summits last year as well as this year. We are associated with many schools in Harare, some of them are the Nation's best schools, including *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John's, Harare High, Advent Hope Academy etc*

07/12/23, 1:08 pm - Arshita: Good to know more about you. 

Do you have any past experience of learning in the field of aerospace engineering?
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 617 1945: No
07/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Just read about it
07/12/23, 1:13 pm - Arshita: That is fine. 

To take your evaluation forward can you please share your O level and form 5 results? 

Pictures will be better
07/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Okay

07/12/23, 1:24 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
07/12/23, 1:24 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
07/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Im confident enough that I have aimed higher
07/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 617 1945: You are welcome
07/12/23, 1:26 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
07/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 617 1945: I had made some research on studying abroad prior being introduced to Edoofa. I have tried applying abroad only to meet scholarship agents who said that they only gave upto 50% tuition which I know will be a burden to my parent. So I rejected their offer
07/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
07/12/23, 1:30 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

07/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 617 1945: What's the difference between software engineering and computer science engineering
07/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Sounds interesting since software engineering was my second option
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: In simple terms, computer science engineering primarily deals with the theoretical and mathematical aspects of computing, emphasizing concepts like algorithms, artificial intelligence, and the theoretical foundations of computation. On the other hand, software engineering is more focused on the practical application of computer science principles to develop software systems. It involves the entire software development lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. While computer science engineering explores the fundamental theories of computation, software engineering focuses on implementing these theories to create effective and efficient software solutions for real-world problems.

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Indian schools prioritize character building and values education, instilling qualities such as discipline, respect, integrity, and empathy in students. These values shape their moral compass and equip them with essential life skills.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 617 1945: India offers quality education too with required practical skills

07/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Wooow interesting
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
07/12/23, 3:21 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
07/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 617 1945: According to the research I did as well as facts you gave me,

Indian companies have taken advantage of the opportunities given to them by the West to develop their intellectual capital. Western investment, and in addition the country's emphasis on education has helped India excel in computer science and be rated as 1 of best places to study computer science 

Computer science courses will help me develop high quantitative and analytical capabilities that can be extended to a variety of technical fields.
As a result,a degree in computer science engineering may be able to obtain prominent work with extremely appealing pay that will support a successful career and allow them to follow their actual interest of learning.
07/12/23, 3:52 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
07/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 617 1945: I just know it's quite expensive but the figures I don't know
07/12/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:54 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
07/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Its not because my father can just afford to get RTGs here in Zimbabwe. Fees in USD is just a broad daylight nightmare to him
07/12/23, 3:56 pm - Arshita: As you know,Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The remaining cost after scholarship and cost of Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family

If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
07/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Yes
07/12/23, 4:02 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
07/12/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 617 1945: No, how
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

07/12/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
07/12/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Yeah I think so especially in the field of technology where u getting the real life experience exposure not just theoretically based where u first get the lesson then the test but vice-vesa in the real world
07/12/23, 5:18 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
07/12/23, 5:18 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 617 1945: You are getting experienced and efficient 
Industry thats benefiting by getting experienced students straight from university
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
07/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Although As a student you are able to cater for yourself through Earn while you learn , the most important task you do is guidance for correct courses selection as most students end up being unconcerned employees with their jobs as they will end up doing wrong programs
07/12/23, 5:31 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
07/12/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 617 1945: 3
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

07/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 71 617 1945: I think experience is something most scholarships don't offer
07/12/23, 5:41 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 617 1945: I guess I have to nicely my parents
07/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Ask
07/12/23, 6:39 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
07/12/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Truely speaking I haven't really asked them but I know if I get an opportunity to go there, they will be very supportive
07/12/23, 6:46 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
07/12/23, 6:46 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
07/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 71 617 1945: This is what I know
07/12/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
07/12/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/12/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Application letter 
Reference letter
List of Awards and achievements
07/12/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 6:59 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
07/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Wooow that's cool
07/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Yess
07/12/23, 7:03 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
07/12/23, 7:03 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Yeah thats flexible
07/12/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
07/12/23, 7:34 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *8:30 am CAT on Friday(08/12/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
07/12/23, 7:34 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 617 1945: Sure
