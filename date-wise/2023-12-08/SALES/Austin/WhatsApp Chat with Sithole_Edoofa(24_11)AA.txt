04/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Yes sir
04/12/23, 1:28 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
04/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 355 4624: No sir
04/12/23, 1:36 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/12/23, 1:37 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:37 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
04/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 355 4624: All the money are paid in US dollars {$2000 _$300}
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 355 4624: As for me its good sir l will form my father is still at work he is coming after Christmas abd and he is not available on WhatsApp now are days
04/12/23, 1:51 pm - Arshita: That is noted! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
04/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Am not sure sir can you tell me
04/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 355 4624: So sir what will be the exactly amount of fees per year
04/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Its good l want to study at your university
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - Arshita: Around this
04/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 355 4624: 6000 - 8000 its us dollars right
04/12/23, 2:53 pm - Arshita: No, after scholarship it is $2000-$3000
04/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Okay l will make sure he pays the money its affordable sir and you said its payed twice a year
04/12/23, 3:05 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
04/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 355 4624: No sir
04/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 355 4624: I am able to do it
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
04/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Yes sir am still reading but
04/12/23, 3:26 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
04/12/23, 3:27 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Yes sir it provide high benefits
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
04/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 355 4624: This this one sir
04/12/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 355 4624: What about if l have more than 1 can l say it
04/12/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: Sure
04/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 355 4624: This one again
04/12/23, 3:52 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.

04/12/23, 7:54 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Thank you sir
05/12/23, 11:36 am - Arshita: Greetings!

*“Experience is not what happens to you; it is what you do with what happens to you.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
05/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 355 4624: Oky sir we can am free
05/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 71 355 4624: Okay sir l admit to that
05/12/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
05/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Network is going out of hand sorry sir
05/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 355 4624: I am fine sir how are you
05/12/23, 12:17 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
05/12/23, 12:17 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
05/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 355 4624: My father sir
05/12/23, 12:18 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with him after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
05/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 355 4624: My mother said its good l allowed you to go
05/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 355 4624: But at the first time she was warried because of lack of financial and l explained to her about beneficial which are offered at your university
05/12/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
05/12/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/12/23, 12:29 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
05/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Yes sir l agree
05/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
05/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
05/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Yes sir
05/12/23, 12:36 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
05/12/23, 12:36 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Oky sir can you tell me the total amount of need from application form up to the last money needed so that when my father came l will tell her and l will give you feed back sir
05/12/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: First and foremost the enrollment fee will be required
05/12/23, 12:48 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Oky sir l understand
05/12/23, 1:15 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 1:34 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
05/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 355 4624: My mother accepted everything l am left with my father and the disadvantage is he is not around and he is not available on WhatsApp
05/12/23, 1:44 pm - Arshita: I can understand that
05/12/23, 1:44 pm - Arshita: Please answer till which stage we have discussed
05/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 355 4624: First stage sir
05/12/23, 1:47 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
05/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Sorry sir l understand now
05/12/23, 1:52 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/12/23, 1:52 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
05/12/23, 1:52 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Yes sir you made it easy and clear
05/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 355 4624: Am l allowed to pay the first money l from next year from January am sure and her l we supposed to pay the money
05/12/23, 1:56 pm - Arshita: The first part will be paid once you get the acceptance letter.
