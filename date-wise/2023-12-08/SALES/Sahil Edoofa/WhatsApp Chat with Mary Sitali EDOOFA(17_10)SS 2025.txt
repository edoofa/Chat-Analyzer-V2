31/10/23, 12:00 pm - +260 97 7561406: Thankyou for information
31/10/23, 12:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure Mary is interested in studying in India. 
So,@260977561406 Can you explain me how studying in India can help Mary advance in her job and how she aim to achieve her career goals as a result of her studies in India?.
31/10/23, 12:15 pm - +260 97 7561406: Because she will be far and away from home ,all her concentration will be on studying hard so that she comes back with best results go come and compete with ZIALE  exams back here
31/10/23, 12:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
31/10/23, 12:19 pm - +260 97 7561406: No I don't but am sure it's so expensive
31/10/23, 12:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
31/10/23, 12:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 12:39 pm - +260 97 7561406: No it's expensive
31/10/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: we are dedicated to supporting talented individuals like you in achieving their educational aspirations. We are pleased to offer our prestigious 90-100% Scholarship, providing you with an exceptional opportunity to pursue your dream degree with minimal financial burden.

If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for this exclusive scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition. We believe in making quality education accessible and affordable for deserving students like you.
31/10/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: But our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative Earn While You Learn Program. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With Edoofa's 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about Earn while you learn program in depth?
31/10/23, 3:39 pm - +260 97 7561406: Yes I understand, now which organization helps to prepare the SOP?
31/10/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Admission team of Edoofa will help you
31/10/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
 How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
31/10/23, 4:04 pm - +260 97 7561406: May spend more than 2000$
31/10/23, 4:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That is right a student may end up paying $1000-$1500 for admission forms on average. +The cost of a Statement of Purpose (SOP) is between $500 and $1000. 

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc*All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$2000 *without Edoofa*, but because of our vision to make education affordable , you can access all these services for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/10/23, 4:06 pm - +260 97 7561406: Oho wonderful, that is manageable
31/10/23, 4:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 4:08 pm - +260 97 7561406: Alright  that is splendid
31/10/23, 4:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their grade 12 result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
31/10/23, 4:09 pm - +260 97 7561406: This is good
31/10/23, 4:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
31/10/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 7561406: Edoofa helps in arranging for manageable applications fees ,SOP ,visa and scholarship if one is eligible
31/10/23, 4:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
31/10/23, 4:21 pm - +260 97 7561406: Well noted and understood
31/10/23, 4:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 4:26 pm - +260 97 7561406: 5th
31/10/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well , 
We had also discussed the Acceptance Letter which a student  receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is the stage 4.

*In Step 1:Connect with counselor-* As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
31/10/23, 4:28 pm - +260 97 7561406: Yes please
31/10/23, 4:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
31/10/23, 4:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Step 6.To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

How are you doing today?
01/11/23, 10:05 am - +260 97 7561406: Am very well thankyou how are you?
01/11/23, 10:25 am - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
01/11/23, 10:25 am - Sahil Edoofa: I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
01/11/23, 10:28 am - +260 97 7561406: Yes
01/11/23, 10:57 am - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?
7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
01/11/23, 11:06 am - +260 97 7561406: Bachelor of ARTS in law.2 India,6000 to 8000$,4between 750$and 1000$5 150 to 200$,7 to 14days,7 yes am clear
01/11/23, 11:28 am - Sahil Edoofa: Are you ready for the same ?
01/11/23, 11:29 am - +260 97 7561406: Yes we are ready
01/11/23, 11:29 am - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes?
01/11/23, 12:10 pm - +260 97 7561406: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
01/11/23, 12:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
01/11/23, 12:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
01/11/23, 12:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 12:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 6th or 7th November 2023 for $200 and the 6th or 7th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 6th or 7th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
01/11/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 7561406: Yes am prepared, we are not in Zimbabwe, we are in zambia

01/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes .
01/11/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7561406: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 1:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What challenges are you facing now ?
01/11/23, 1:24 pm - +260 97 7561406: Like financially?because we already got paid salaries for October,
01/11/23, 1:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So have you already utilized it ?

01/11/23, 1:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Mary, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Mary's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
01/11/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 7561406: Yes we can
01/11/23, 1:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Mary's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Mary's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
01/11/23, 1:33 pm - +260 97 7561406: This is very convenient for us yes
01/11/23, 1:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes ?
