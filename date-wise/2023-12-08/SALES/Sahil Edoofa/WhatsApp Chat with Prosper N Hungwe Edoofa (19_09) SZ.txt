20/09/23, 11:31 am - +27 73 928 3175: Yes
20/09/23, 11:53 am - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mr. Lovemore. *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a merit-based program with limited seats. Getting a seat as well as the scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews. Additionally, his/her academic results, his/her O level, and his/her A level results. Moreover, His/her participation in extracurricular activities will be taken into account as well.
20/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Afternoon.sorry had a challenge with my phone but.im now available
20/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 227 1141: For O and A'level results what are the expected results
20/09/23, 12:15 pm - +91 82875 72068: That is totally fine, Mrs. Tsitsi.
20/09/23, 12:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mrs. Tsitsi, the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough resources and study materials, due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
20/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 227 1141: well understood.
20/09/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 227 1141: At O level how many subjects are required and which are conscidered
20/09/23, 12:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Mrs. Tsitsi, that depends on the course which the student wants to pursue. Not to worry, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.

Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
21/09/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 090 4054: No im not familiar to the costs
21/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Im not familiar with the costs can you enlighten me
21/09/23, 10:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Prosper! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
21/09/23, 10:06 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:06 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
21/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 090 4054: i think they will be able to make ends meet but are there any ways of financing myself during the course
21/09/23, 10:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Please enlighten me more
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Prosper. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
21/09/23, 10:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Yes indeed, they will be beneficial to me
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
21/09/23, 10:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

21/09/23, 10:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
21/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Yah i do realize that now
So i think we can afford the fees
21/09/23, 10:39 pm - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
21/09/23, 10:39 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
21/09/23, 10:39 pm - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
21/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 090 4054: First of all its hard to pick one point when all points are equally overwhelming. Despite their advantages i will have to go with the third point
21/09/23, 10:52 pm - +91 82875 72068: Now I know you focus more on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
21/09/23, 10:54 pm - +263 78 090 4054: They are excited that i will be learning abroad on a whole new level and being exposed to different mindsets
21/09/23, 10:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
21/09/23, 10:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
21/09/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 090 4054: That is correct
But the interview questions should be asked sometimes because not all of us can just write all our thoughts and ambitions down and if we do the essay woukd be very long. So some guidelines and questions should be asked
21/09/23, 10:59 pm - +263 78 090 4054: I agree with you
21/09/23, 10:59 pm - +91 82875 72068: Can you please reframe your message, Prosper?
21/09/23, 11:01 pm - +263 78 090 4054: I was suggesting that interview questions should be included in the application forms
21/09/23, 11:07 pm - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Prosper. *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
21/09/23, 11:07 pm - +91 82875 72068: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
21/09/23, 11:08 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 11:08 pm - +91 82875 72068: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
21/09/23, 11:11 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Ok
21/09/23, 11:13 pm - +91 82875 72068: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
21/09/23, 11:14 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Ok nice
21/09/23, 11:14 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/09/23, 11:16 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Thats nice
21/09/23, 11:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
21/09/23, 11:21 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Through the Earn while you learn program a sfudent can earn credit which he or she can use to pay for fees after completing certain tasks. The program is also in 3 parts that is counseling session, earn while you learn program classes and submission of A level results where if one fails to meet the university requirements is refunded the $350 program fee
21/09/23, 11:22 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
21/09/23, 11:22 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Ok
21/09/23, 11:23 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 11:24 pm - +263 78 090 4054: 01
21/09/23, 11:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
21/09/23, 11:26 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Ok please do
21/09/23, 11:26 pm - +91 82875 72068: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$750) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
21/09/23, 11:28 pm - +263 78 090 4054: I do
21/09/23, 11:29 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

21/09/23, 11:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

21/09/23, 11:38 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Need some clarification here. Do we pay Edoofa enrolment fee 350 for 30 Sept group then afterwards pay 500-750 university enrolment fees
22/09/23, 7:42 am - +91 82875 72068: A delightful morning to you, Mrs. Tsitsi. I hope you are having a marvelous day! Can you please elaborate your query? If you are concerned about the enrollment fees, The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in the next 30 days

25/09/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/09/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

25/09/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 4:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: : Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30th September 2023 for $200 and the 29th or 30th of October for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 29th or 30th of September 2023.
 Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

25/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 227 1141: I understand that given this.opportunity we can make ends meet and be able to pay yearly university costs after scholarship. I have a few questions that came up after our discussion.
1. In the event of an unforseen event like loss of job or death of the financer when we have enrolled with the university and paid maybe for 1 or 2 years of the program and  no longer afford to pay for the remaining years what happens. Is there a way forward so that the student finishes studies and pay latter

04/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Not at the moment all this you have explained to us earlier on
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: you must have seen, there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 11% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
