But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

26/09/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
26/09/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow, Yeukai?
26/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 029 9910: Im still going through it
26/09/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
26/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 029 9910: I did
26/09/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Yeukai!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
26/09/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 029 9910: No we are not
26/09/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
26/09/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/09/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 029 9910: It is really costly
26/09/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/09/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/09/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 029 9910: This might be affordable sure
26/09/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Isn't that exciting?
26/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 029 9910: Yes its great
26/09/23, 8:23 pm - Harmehak: I am glad Yeukai, 

You see Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
26/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 029 9910: I agree
26/09/23, 8:31 pm - Harmehak: So are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
26/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 029 9910: Yes
26/09/23, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
26/09/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue however I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 09 AM CAT*, as my working hours have been long over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

I wish you a blessed evening ahead!
26/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 029 9910: Thank you ma'am
27/09/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
27/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 029 9910: Good morning ma'am

Sure we can start
27/09/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Wonderful, now lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail, and how it would assist you and your family.
27/09/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/09/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
27/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 029 9910: The earn while you learn program is it when you go to work and still be studying
27/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 029 9910: Will the job be under sociology ??
27/09/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: It's an online program please,

You would alloted a dedicated mentor who would assist you with your projects.
27/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 029 9910: Oky i get it
27/09/23, 9:10 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

27/09/23, 9:11 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 029 9910: Duly received
27/09/23, 9:17 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 029 9910: Got it
27/09/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: So far do you have any queries, Yeukai?
27/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 029 9910: So Edoofa will be helping me with digital marketing ?
27/09/23, 9:26 am - Harmehak: I didn't get you please.

Can you elaborate?
27/09/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 029 9910: How do i earn the scholarship credits ??
27/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 029 9910: What do you mean by scholarship credits
27/09/23, 9:28 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly read the same please?
27/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 029 9910: Yes
27/09/23, 9:29 am - Harmehak: Did you happen to understand what are scholarship credits, Yeukai?
27/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 029 9910: No i didn't
27/09/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Scholarship credits are equivalent to physical cash that you earn after working on projects under the EWYL Program!
27/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 029 9910: I got it now
27/09/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
04/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 562 3658: Welcome . Yaa as a parent l am prepared to pay the fees for  Yeukai if  that chance arises

05/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 562 3658: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 10th or 11th  October 2023 for $200 and the 10th or 11th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 10th or 11th  of October 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

I've observed that my messages are been read but not responded to.Is everything alright? @263715623658 @263780299910
10/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 562 3658: Helo . Yeukai is supposed to answer most of the questions and l hope she is to reply soon
10/10/23, 1:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Parents have to answer in students absence
10/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 562 3658: Now the biggest challenge now is the payment of the fees which l cannot manage this October.
10/10/23, 2:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: When did you start to plan for your child’s education abroad ?
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 562 3658: It was just recently because we knew nothing about this Edoofa and after Yeukai was told by her friend
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How much monthly plans have your family made for your education?
10/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 562 3658: Since Yeukai had no find anything tangible l had not planned for her soon
10/10/23, 3:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Yeukai's, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Yeukai's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
10/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 562 3658: Go ahead
10/10/23, 3:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Yeukai's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Yeukai's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
10/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 562 3658: That's true l understand
10/10/23, 3:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So is this convenient for your family ?

How are you doing today ?
12/10/23, 11:25 am - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
