Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 83 986 0810: It's a tricky one is it a computer keyboard 🤣
06/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you are right!🚀✨
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - +27 83 986 0810: 😩

06/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

06/12/23, 2:08 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes black 😁
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, alright!Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Can you state them please
06/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/12/23, 2:23 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes I heard that one.
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our today's session here, and I can't wait to connect with you in our next session tomorrow!

07/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Kelvin!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 3:39 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Good afternoon how are you
07/12/23, 3:40 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I have never head of this
07/12/23, 4:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I was looking forward to a wonderful session today. Unfortunately, we couldn't connect. Now, I am expecting our session tomorrow at 1:30 p.m to be fruitful., and I hope to see you there!
In the meantime, I would appreciate an explanation for why you were unable to attend our scheduled session. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
