28/08/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260977850766 

How are you?
28/08/23, 2:58 pm - +260 97 7850766: Fine thank you and how are you
28/08/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to the new members who have joined our group for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey. It would be highly appreciated if each of you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
28/08/23, 2:59 pm - +260 95 0590514: Am Patricia Lukwanda Tehila's mother
28/08/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 7850766: My name is Tehila Yalubamba .
28/08/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you!
28/08/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
28/08/23, 3:01 pm - +260 95 0590514: Waiting to hear from you
28/08/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
28/08/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
28/08/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
28/08/23, 3:04 pm - +260 95 0590514: Ok
28/08/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 7850766: I have understood .
28/08/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️
28/08/23, 3:08 pm - +260 97 7850766: Okay thank you
28/08/23, 3:09 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thanks
29/08/23, 9:30 am - +260 97 7850766: I'm online
29/08/23, 9:31 am - +260 95 0590514: Good morning
29/08/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
29/08/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 7850766: Good afternoon yes
29/08/23, 2:16 pm - +260 95 0590514: Yes
29/08/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
29/08/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:32 pm - +260 95 0590514: That is very encouraging.
29/08/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 7850766: That's interesting
29/08/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/08/23, 2:51 pm - +260 97 7850766: Thank you
29/08/23, 2:56 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thank you
29/08/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
29/08/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 7850766: It's a very encouraging news and I most say it is very interesting to read .
29/08/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tomorrow is the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate the special bond they share. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection. In return, brothers often give gifts and offer their support.⭐

Therefore, we won't be connecting tomorrow, we shall connect on Thursday now!
29/08/23, 3:08 pm - +260 97 7850766: Wow I have heard so much about that day . So Thursday it is then
29/08/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The festival is tomorrow and we will be connecting on Thursday!
29/08/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 7850766: Oh okay all the best in the celebrations. Thank you
29/08/23, 3:12 pm - +260 95 0590514: OK  you have a rich culture we envy. All the best

01/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
01/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
01/09/23, 9:40 am - +260 97 7850766: Noted thank you I will let you know when I have sent the mail
01/09/23, 10:38 am - +260 97 7850766: I have sent them .

08/09/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tehila!

I am good, I want to ask about these images. I could not understand the importance of them in your EWYL group. Can you please help me understand the same?
09/09/23, 2:39 pm - +260 95 0590514: Sorry posted in the wrong site
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 5:05 pm - +260 95 0590514: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 2.00pm to 3.00pm
19/09/23, 8:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let us connect today at 2:00PM
19/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
19/09/23, 8:29 pm - +260 97 7850766: The whole afternoon my phone call not connect until now
20/09/23, 7:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, shall we connect today?
20/09/23, 9:09 am - +260 97 7850766: Thanks
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
20/09/23, 1:51 pm - +260 97 7850766: Yes
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for NAME’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tehila?
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - +260 97 7850766: That's sounds okey am Tehila's mother she is still at school they are not allowed to have phones
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, ma'am!
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that NAME will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:31 pm - +260 97 7850766: Am done
20/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Tehila can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 7850766: Ok
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 2:06 pm - +260 97 7850766: Am ready
21/09/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, Tehila may I ask if you wish to move forward with the next stage or you wish to continue with this next stage once you are done with your exams?
21/09/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 7850766: Am Tehila's mother she is at boarding school and phones are not allowed
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Tehila’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals.

As per our discussion, She would resume his EWYL Process on 16 November 2023. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
21/09/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 7850766: Thanks
19/10/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

Take a little break, relax, and let this video inspire and motivate you. You've got this! 💪
Wishing you all the best of luck with your exams! Stay focused and keep shining. ✨
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thanks I will send it to my daughter
20/10/23, 11:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: You can also watch the video and share the key points or insights you gather from the video I shared? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts so that I can share more of these in the future!
27/10/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I'm also curious to learn about your cultural festivals. Why don't you share some photos or videos of your cultural festival?
28/10/23, 12:30 pm - +260 95 0590514: OK I will do that
31/10/23, 6:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Tehila and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 8:16 pm - +260 95 0590514: Thank you very much mentor
07/11/23, 8:17 pm - +260 95 0590514: Am half Zimbabwean am able to hear the words from the song
07/11/23, 8:18 pm - +260 95 0590514: Am excited for my daughter
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260950590514 @260977850766

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 9:16 am - +260 95 0590514: Good morning, I didn't know that the Basenji dogs are the ones  who are barkless.
24/11/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Tehila, your session is just an hour long. I hope you understand that if you are going to be late, then we won't be able to have a fruitful discussion, how will you earn credits? Therefore, it is suggested that from tomorrow, be on time.
24/11/23, 9:21 am - +260 95 0590514: Ok
24/11/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me, Let's connect in our next session, scheduled for Monday at 8:30 am. Please note that we do not have sessions on Saturday and Sunday.

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you! <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 8:47 am - +260 97 7850766: Ohh wow that's cool
04/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
04/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
04/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
04/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
04/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
04/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

04/12/23, 8:52 am - +260 97 7850766: Okay
04/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
04/12/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

​​
05/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: ​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
05/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available.

06/12/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
06/12/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 7850766: Emmanuel Adventist Secondary school.
In the central province
06/12/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
06/12/23, 8:55 am - +260 97 7850766: Okay
06/12/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head ?
06/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 7850766: Well I don't have it but let me try asking around for it
06/12/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
06/12/23, 8:59 am - +260 97 7850766: Okay let me do it right now
06/12/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
06/12/23, 9:01 am - +260 97 7850766: Okay I will thank you
06/12/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
06/12/23, 9:02 am - +260 97 7850766: Okay I will do so
06/12/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday  and Thursday -  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
06/12/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
06/12/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
06/12/23, 9:21 am - +260 97 7850766: Okay
06/12/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's conclude it here. 

Meanwhile, check out this amazing post on the Edoofa page and see what we have for you!
