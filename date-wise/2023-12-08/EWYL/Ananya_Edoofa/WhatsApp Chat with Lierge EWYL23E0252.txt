I hope you are doing great! I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to connect today because I have some personal work that needs my urgent attention.

Meanwhile, I would recommend you to read the following article and understand the importance of Excel, and then share a note with me about why you think Excel is important for a student and its various uses.

Lately, I've noticed that some of you haven't been consistently following your EWYL ritual on the EWYL line. I want to stress that this small gesture plays a significant role in maintaining your attendance records and ensuring you receive the full benefits of our program.

So, if not done, go and say "I am a proud Edoofian" on your Line. It's not just a phrase; it's a symbol of your commitment to your education and our collective journey.

Reminder: If not done, go and say "I am a proud Edoofian" on your Line so that you can receive your Saturday activity!
02/10/23, 8:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning! I hope you are doing well.

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to kindly remind you that we have our sessions regularly scheduled, and it would be great if you could join us without needing a reminder each time. Your participation is valuable, and it helps you get the most out of our sessions. I believe in your ability to take this responsibility seriously and be more punctual in our sessions.
23/10/23, 12:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Lierge!

It's Monday today, and I'm looking forward to our session on the EWYL line. Please join quickly!
29/10/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Lierge!

I hope all is well with you. I noticed you didn't follow your EWYL Ritual of saying the proud Edoofian on your EWYL Line this time. Due to this, I couldn't share your weekly activity with you, and this might impact your performance in the EWYL program. Therefore, I'm reminding you to include the ritual in your message when you can. This way, I can share our weekly activity with you!
02/11/23, 12:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Our session was scheduled for 12:00 p.m., and I am waiting for you on your EWYL line. Kindly join in quickly!🚀

Your session time has already started, and I am waiting for you on your EWYL line. Kindly join!
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

22/11/23, 10:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning @263772991227 @263779550442 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
04/12/23, 12:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tafafzwanashe!

I hope you are doing well. I've noticed that you consistently join the session late without my reminder. Your sessions are scheduled, and I've been waiting for you on your EWYL Line. Being punctual demonstrates dedication and sincerity not only to the program but to all aspects of life.

I want to emphasize the importance of punctuality. Is it acceptable if I don't conduct the session if you are not here on time?
07/12/23, 12:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Lierge!

I have been waiting for you on your EWYL Line. Are you not going to attend our today's session?
