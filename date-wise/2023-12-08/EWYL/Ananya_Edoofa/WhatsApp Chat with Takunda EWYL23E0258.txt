04/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 365 2847: My name is Takunda Mtare, I am a vibrant 19-year-old boy whose world revolves around the enchantment of reading novels, the symphony of music, the joy of selflessness, the exhilaration of sports, and the sheer delight of savoring scrumptious culinary creations.
04/08/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, you know Takunda I also like reading Novels!
04/08/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: What's your favorite Genre?

04/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 365 2847: That is truly amazing

07/08/23, 11:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: I apologize for not being able to connect earlier today. Our entire team was at the airport to greet our second group of students. It was an incredible moment, especially because a significant number of my own students were part of this batch!
07/08/23, 11:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/08/23, 11:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/08/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 365 2847: It is okay Ms Ananya am glad the second group made it safely
08/08/23, 8:30 am - +263 71 365 2847: Good morning Ms Ananya
08/08/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: A lovely morning to my Proud Edoofian!

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session?
08/08/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 365 2847: Yes I am
08/08/23, 8:39 am - +263 71 365 2847: I am doing well and you?
08/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am good, Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/08/23, 8:43 am - +263 71 365 2847: No I do not.
08/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let me explain. So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
08/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
08/08/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 365 2847: Understood, thank you for the explanation on both key objectives
08/08/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
08/08/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 365 2847: Okay will do
08/08/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 365 2847: It's a pleasure to know you Ms Deepali and Ms Davi, and I am most grateful to be helped by both of you.
08/08/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
08/08/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 365 2847: I am done reading the newsletter
08/08/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
08/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 365 2847: My favorite section is about the 2 questions they have for me. I've understood that success is often portrayed as an overnight phenomenon, but the reality is that it is often the result of small consistent steps taken  over time rather than making a huge big step. Long term success is an accumulation of small daily efforts rather than one huge step. Small steps are achievable as compared to large as large ones can be difficult to start and at most maintain them hence small steps are okay.

Taking small steps is the same as taking 1 huge step but in due course.

I was also inspired by my fellow Zimbabwean Praise Parwaringira who took part in the trash to cash challenge and I am amazed by the wonders she has done not for herself but for the community, this is truly something inspiring and I wish her all the best as she continues with her journey.
08/08/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
08/08/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Takunda! That's amazing!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🛩️
10/08/23, 8:36 am - +263 71 365 2847: Yes I am.
10/08/23, 8:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Today, So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
10/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 365 2847: OK will do
10/08/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
10/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 365 2847: Upon reading the document I have to understand that the task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enroll for EDOOFA.
I have understood that certain factor need to be taken into account such as

a) *Nature of company*- the nature of the Company must be able to accommodate the needs of students or recreational to them.

b) *Scale of company*- the scale of the company being approched should not be too small or too big.

c) *Financial stability*- companies selected must be financially stable.

d) *Background of founder* - the founder of the company needs to be done a background on to check for experience and qualifications.

To pursue this one has to open up a LinkedIn profile to access information about the company which is *Step 1- Searching* There 3 tabs on a LinkedIn page of a company and these are-
~Home-check the current activities posted if they looking for interns 
~About-gives a brief explanation of the company's mission, accomplishments, workers and year founded 
~People - gives information and profile links to the employees of the organisation's.

*Step 2*
Is getting more information on the company for instance it's foundation, functioning, past collaboration and current ones.

*Step 3*
Study the company website and get some Intel, see how it functions. If the company functions through an app it is best to download and get some reviews on it.

*Step. 4*
Check various social media pages of the company. This can give you an idea of the activities and functioning status of the company.

*Step 5*
Study background of founder and core members through the use of the LinkedIn profile.

*Step 6*
Reach out to them when fully satisfied.
10/08/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know what , this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
14/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 365 2847: Okay, noted

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6):

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
14/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 365 2847: Kindly noted.
14/08/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
14/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 365 2847: This is truly amazing.
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 365 2847: Okay
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/08/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

14/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 365 2847: I have noted the process that I have to follow.
14/08/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/08/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
18/09/23, 8:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.

OR

Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
