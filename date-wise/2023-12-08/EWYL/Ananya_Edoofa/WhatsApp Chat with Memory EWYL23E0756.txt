13/10/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 339 0549: The objectives are to work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program. <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 220 4972: No may you please elaborate the two key objectives for me
13/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
13/10/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
13/10/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 220 4972: Understood thank you
13/10/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It was a wonderful experience connecting with my new student. Let's wrap up our session for today, and we'll reconvene in our next session. Please note that we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays.

Wishing you a fantastic weekend! 🌸

16/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 339 0549: We can continue
16/10/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Memory*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Memory* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
19/10/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

19/10/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The initial sessions are now complete. Memory will contact me through this EWYL line after her exams. Is is alright?

19/10/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: However, in order to put her sessions on hold as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my exams.

I hope all is well with you. I noticed you didn't follow your EWYL Ritual of saying the proud Edoofian on your EWYL Line this time. Due to this, I couldn't share your weekly activity with you, and this might impact your performance in the EWYL program. Therefore, I'm reminding you to include the ritual in your message when you can. This way, I can share our weekly activity with you! <This message was edited>

09/11/23, 10:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Thursday at 9:30 a.m.* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 10:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
