On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

04/09/23, 9:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams.

15/09/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 904 0377: I acknowledge

19/09/23, 1:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

22/09/23, 12:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Hazel can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 904 0377: Yes we are
22/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
22/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 904 0377: The student is not available and will be back in November I prefer that we begin the sessions whilst she is around so that she benefits personally. I hope it's understandable
22/09/23, 1:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, of course
22/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: These are just basic formalities that needs to be performed.
22/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
22/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/09/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/09/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
22/09/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/09/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
22/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

29/11/23, 9:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Hazel,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
29/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 838 9039: Im doing great thank you

Yes we may begin with our session
29/11/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you learned from it?
29/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 838 9039: I learnt that the corporate alliance project helps me to have a better understanding of the market that im going to be entering in the future
29/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 838 9039: I have to identify companies that are in the same field that i will be entering in the future and explain how edoofa is enhancing my skills in this particular field. I also have to create a linkedin account to reach out to managers  and heads of organisations so that they share a meeting with edoofa. I also learnt that creating this linkedin account will expand my proffesional network and increases my chances of gaining internships and job opportunities in my country.
29/11/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Hazel. I’m happy with your understanding.
29/11/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
29/11/23, 9:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 838 9039: Thank you
29/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 838 9039: Okay sure
29/11/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 838 9039: Factors that ensure one looks for the right companies to collaborate with edoofa are nature of company that is whether the company is recreational, student centric or content centric. Other factors include scale of the company that number of employees in the company should not be too big or too small, financial stability of company and  background of the founder or owner. Platforms that can be used for this research are linkedin, google and social media pages such as instagram and facebook. During research one should search for startup news for the different companies, check current activities of the interns and use tabs to get more insight of the campany. I should also study the website to get information about the members and core founders of the company as well as study their backgrounds.
29/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 838 9039: This is what I have understood from the document
29/11/23, 10:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Hazel, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
29/11/23, 10:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
29/11/23, 10:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to

29/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 838 9039: Thank you
29/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 838 9039: Okay
29/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 838 9039: When can I submit the form?
29/11/23, 10:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
29/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 838 9039: Okay thank you I will submit the form when I have enough information
29/11/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
30/11/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Hazel,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
30/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 838 9039: Im good how are you Ms Saloni
30/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 838 9039: Yes we may begin with our session
30/11/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
30/11/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Hazel, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Hazel!
30/11/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 838 9039: Sure thing
30/11/23, 9:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you listen to the audio, do let me know.
30/11/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 838 9039: Im done listening to the audio
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
30/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 838 9039: Edoofians have a spirit of community building and community building was defined as  the process of establishing relationships among individuals within a group or community. The goal of community building is to form a positive community to promote participation in a shared force of responsibility so that a common goal is reached. This is very useful in the second project called community building. Studenta have to reach out to extended networks so as to identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers . Students are supposed to reach out to african students who have completed school so that they become part of the edoofa scholarship program and earn scholarship credits
30/11/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Hazel, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
30/11/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

30/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 838 9039: Thank you
30/11/23, 9:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
30/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 838 9039: Thank you Ms Saloni
I have understood
30/11/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
30/11/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Hazel/Saloni/30NOV2023*
30/11/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
30/11/23, 9:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
30/11/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
30/11/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
30/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 838 9039: Okay
30/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from this process?
30/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 838 9039: I am supposed to create a group and find the right student that can be part of the group so that I can reach out to a lot of students and tell them about edoofa
30/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 838 9039: This will help the student have a smooth counselling session afterwards. And to identify the right student i have to get in touch with my schoolmates currently doing their form 6 or who are already done with form 6
30/11/23, 9:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, and your homework for today will be today to create the group and also don't forget to add me.
30/11/23, 9:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
30/11/23, 9:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
30/11/23, 9:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
30/11/23, 9:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
30/11/23, 9:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 838 9039: Okay 
Should I also add the candidate 
I have a friend who was asking about the Edoofa scholarship program. She sounds really interested
30/11/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, form the group and keep adding all the participants.
30/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 838 9039: Okay
30/11/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there!
30/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 838 9039: Thank you
30/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 838 9039: See you tomorrow 
Have a great day❤️

04/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 838 9039: So can I create the group and add her
04/12/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am happy to hear that!
Well, for now, you can share the all the information about Edoofa and the form for the community building to that student and later on, when you get time, form the group and then share details with all other students as well.
04/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 838 9039: Okay
04/12/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
04/12/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

07/12/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
