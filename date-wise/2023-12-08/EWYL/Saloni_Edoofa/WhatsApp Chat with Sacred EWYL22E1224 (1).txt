In the tapestry of life, each day is a thread waiting to be woven into greatness. Begin with a plan, a roadmap for your day. With purposeful steps, you'll sculpt your time into a masterpiece, avoiding stress and embracing productivity. Remember, a well-planned day paves the path to prosperity.
10/08/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your mind is a flame, not a vessel. Ignite it with positivity. Banish the shadows of doubt, for negative thoughts are but clouds that obscure your brilliance. When challenges arise, remind yourself: "Hard is not impossible." If you believe you can't, you're holding the key to your own cage. Embrace the fire of determination and watch your dreams ignite.

20/10/23, 8:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, I have tried to schedule multiple calls with you and there has been no response from your end towards the call. I am sure there must be a valid reason with you for missing more than 10 calls that I have been scheduling so far. Sacred in a similar way, I also understand the pressure that you must be receiving from these exams in the initial stage, I have gone through it and I can completely empathize with it. But I just want to at least discuss things and make it easier for both of us in the future. Today, I made sure that as soon as I start my work, I share what I feel about the situation. Please share with me if there is anything. I am genuinely saying it you that I always consider every student my younger brother/sister and like an internal family. Trust me, I will help you out if there is anything even beyond Edoofa.

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

I want to begin the session by asking if you have understood the $300 Training document well?
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 83607 55268: You said I will be given #300 per each student if l recruit some students.. And the $300 will.be divided into 3 part.The first $100 will be give if the student pays the first part of the enrollment fee ,the second $100 if the students pays the last part and the last $100 if the student arrives in India
15/11/23, 3:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is perfect!
15/11/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
15/11/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have you gone through the document?
15/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 83607 55268: Noo...you once sent the voice note so used those notes

15/11/23, 3:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know the challenges that have caused the delay in you going through it?
15/11/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
