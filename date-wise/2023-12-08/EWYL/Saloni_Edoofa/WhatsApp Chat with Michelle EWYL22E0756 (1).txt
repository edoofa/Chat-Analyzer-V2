15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 307 7977: I understand

How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

03/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Good Afternoon ma'am
03/10/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for NAME’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Michelle?
03/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 307 7977: It sounds very good
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Michelle will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
03/10/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Michelle can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Yes we are
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
03/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 307 7977: I understand 🙏
03/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
03/10/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you have done this, do let me know.
03/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 307 7977: I did it .
16/10/23, 1:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂.

While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

05/12/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Michelle. I’m happy with your understanding.
05/12/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
05/12/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
05/12/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
05/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 307 7977: I have read the document and I understand that it expects one to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and that are willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enrol for the Edoofa program 

I've also understood that one needs to understand the company better in terms of it's nature and background
05/12/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, let me summarize it for you once!
05/12/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
05/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright I understand
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
