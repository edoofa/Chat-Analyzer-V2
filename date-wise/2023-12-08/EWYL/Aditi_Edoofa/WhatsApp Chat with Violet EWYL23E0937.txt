05/12/23, 2:06 pm - +260 96 7541638: Yes I'm
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: First off I would like to extend a warm welcome to your father for this amazing EWYL Journey of yours.
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/12/23, 2:17 pm - +260 96 7541638: My long term goals are to build a foundation which is helpful to all a foundation that will help me help others and with this program I personally I feel it can help me learn to work hard and put in more effort in wanting to earn something it will also me know how to manage my finances in the future
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals of establishing a foundation to assist others resonate deeply with the values of this program. It's commendable that you see this opportunity not only as a means to learn the value of hard work and dedication but also as a pathway to understanding financial management for the future. The program indeed offers a holistic approach, providing you with the skills and experiences that align with your aspirations of making a positive impact on the community. I'm excited to see how this journey helps shape and support your long-term vision.
05/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 96 7541638: Thank you very much
05/12/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 2:40 pm - +260 96 7541638: No kindly explain
05/12/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 2:46 pm - +260 96 7541638: Well understood
05/12/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/12/23, 2:50 pm - +260 96 7541638: Alright no problem
05/12/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/12/23, 2:52 pm - +260 96 7541638: Very interesting
05/12/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

Subject Combination in Grade 12:-
Current Class ( Grade 11/ Grade 12/ Grade 12 Appeared):

I will be appearing for my Grade 12(Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
07/12/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - +260 96 7541638: This is exciting
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - +260 96 7541638: Once I share this form of information  with them I need to send it back to the team
07/12/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You need to share the filled out application form with me in this EWYL Group, okay?
07/12/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/12/23, 2:45 pm - +260 96 7541638: Alright
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *-A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
STEP 1: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*VIOLET/ADITI*
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6) :

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:56 pm - +260 96 7541638: Not really clear with this information though
07/12/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To find the right student (applicant), we can talk to our school friends who are in the grade 12 or those who have finished their grade 12 exams. Let's say you've contacted students. If there are, on average, three groups, and each group has about 20 students, let's focus on the first group. The first thing to do is connect with these 20 students and ask them to add you to their WhatsApp group (official or unofficial) if you're not already in it.

Once you've shared this info with one group, do the same with the other groups. This way, you'll have reached out to at least 60 students. <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 3:00 pm - +260 96 7541638: Alright thank you that's clear
07/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zambia, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month.

On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zambia, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
