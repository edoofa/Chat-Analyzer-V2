19/10/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning Michelin! ☀️
May your day be filled with positivity, productivity, and moments of joy
19/10/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
19/10/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 985 0099: Morning ma' am
19/10/23, 10:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Michelin, I've noticed that you've left my message on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.

If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
19/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 985 0099: Notes
19/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 985 0099: Noted ma'am
19/10/23, 12:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm thrilled to embark on this exciting journey with each of you. Our EWYL program promises to be a valuable experience, and it's our collective commitment that will make it a success.

As we kick off this journey, I want to emphasize the importance of regular attendance and active participation. Consistency is key in making the most of this opportunity. By engaging in discussions, attending sessions, and completing assignments, we will all benefit and grow together.
19/10/23, 12:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

19/10/23, 1:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings @263775583873 ! I hope you are doing well. I am *Ms. Aditi*, and I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey. It would be highly appreciated if each of you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
19/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Okay I'm Mrs Ruza michelins mother
19/10/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Michelin will learn a lot from this journey to success.
I can see that Michelin is very lucky to have such supportive parents like you.
19/10/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know if you are available for carrying out these sessions on behalf of Michelin from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM CAT?
19/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Yes we wish her all the best and thank you for the welcome
19/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Yes that's if I'm free I will
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, that would be appreciated if you would attend those as these sessions are crucial for her journey.
19/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Oky
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before we start the session could you briefly walk us through the two core objectives of the EWYL program?
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 558 3873: From my understanding I think it's too reduce her fees and to earn experience and skills
19/10/23, 1:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Michelin* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
19/10/23, 1:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
19/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Oky
19/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Oky
19/10/23, 1:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
19/10/23, 1:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

19/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Noted
19/10/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Michelin* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 558 3873: I hear you
19/10/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Michelin* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

19/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope that you must have gone through the newsletter.
19/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Michelin*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure she is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Yes just finished
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 558 3873: Oky yes
19/10/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Michelin* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
19/10/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction. I can't wait for our next one.

20/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 985 0099: It's my father and my sister currently they are offline
20/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted.
20/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things you are good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully

20/10/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
20/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 985 0099: No I dont
20/10/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
20/10/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
20/10/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries
20/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 985 0099: Yes  ma' am
20/10/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know when will you be available to resume your EWYL Process and on which date?
20/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 985 0099: 13 NOVEMBER I WILL BE DONE WITH MY EXAMS
20/10/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
20/10/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
20/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 985 0099: Noted on that

20/10/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking out time to complete these discussions, I really appreciate it.
20/10/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now we will connect on 13th November, 23 after your exams are over.
20/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 985 0099: Noted ma' am
20/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 985 0099: Thank you for giving me the time
