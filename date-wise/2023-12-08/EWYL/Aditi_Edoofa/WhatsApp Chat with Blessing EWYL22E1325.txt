14/08/23, 4:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I am happy to hear that!
21/08/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings, champion! I am delighted to present you with the grant, and I want to express that your dedication and effort have yielded remarkable results. Your hard work has truly been rewarded, and I am thrilled to acknowledge your achievement in winning the 21-day grant challenge.
21/08/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
21/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 664 9363: Ready
21/08/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
21/08/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
21/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 664 9363: True
21/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
21/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 664 9363: You can enlighten
21/08/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion has not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
21/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 664 9363: Thank you for the encouragement
21/08/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
21/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 664 9363: I will do so
21/08/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
21/08/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 664 9363: Oky
21/08/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.
21/08/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
23/08/23, 9:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings of the day Blessing
Hope you are well.
23/08/23, 9:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Blessing may I know why haven't I received your signed grant letter yet, I hope you are well aware that due to such things, your grant can be revoked as this grant was provided to you because I specially requested Ms. Deepali and the team Edoofa, so please be regular and active in our conversations as these are scheduled according to your convenience only.

You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

14/11/23, 1:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Why Blessing I need a valid reason for that.
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
