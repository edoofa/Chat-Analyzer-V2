Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

01/09/23, 1:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have a wonderful weekend ahead!
16/09/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Joyce!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
19/09/23, 7:31 pm - +260 97 7632700: Joyce is not allowed to go with a phone at school, so for her it will not be possible .
20/09/23, 8:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
20/09/23, 8:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: Then @260977632700 you can continue these sessions on her behalf and let me know the timings.
20/09/23, 8:32 am - +260 97 7632700: Okay 02 and 03pm
20/09/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted.
So we will connect at 2:00 PM
20/09/23, 8:33 am - +260 97 7632700: Okay
20/09/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, are you ready to start our session?
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 7632700: No
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7632700: What are they
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay noted
20/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
20/09/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - +260 97 7632700: I 

While! I have gone through it ,it sounds so good
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, I hope Joyce will also earn good amount of credits like this.
20/09/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/09/23, 2:48 pm - +260 97 7632700: Well noted
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/09/23, 3:07 pm - +260 97 7632700: Mmm Saturday for me is not ideal, I worship on that day and am at church the whole day, how can I be Helped
20/09/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 7632700: What is the meaning of NAME, is it literal meaning or it means just the way it is
21/09/23, 8:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings
Hope you are well. <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 8:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: This structure is for Joyce to follow, when she comes back for her sessions.
21/09/23, 8:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for that it is a typing error on my side.
Thank you for understanding.
21/09/23, 8:24 am - +260 97 7632700: Okay noted
21/09/23, 8:26 am - +260 97 7632700: Am fine thank you,how about you
21/09/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
21/09/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good afternoon!
Hope you are well.

Are you ready for today's session?
21/09/23, 2:27 pm - +260 97 7632700: Yes sorry I delayed to knock off from work
21/09/23, 2:31 pm - +260 97 7632700: Am ready
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, no issues.
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Joyce forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

21/09/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 7632700: So motivating thanks
21/09/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Joyce's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure Joyce is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
21/09/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 7632700: Good, greatly noted and appreciated
21/09/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today.
Wishing you a wonderful day ahead
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 7632700: Thanks a million for educating me
21/09/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!

25/09/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 7632700: Thanks
25/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Joyce will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

26/09/23, 2:10 pm - +260 97 7632700: Okay
26/09/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Joyce can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things Joyce is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
26/09/23, 2:30 pm - +260 97 7632700: Noted
26/09/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

I hope you will understand.
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - +260 97 7632700: Understood thanks
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Joyce is back, she is supposed to note a few things.

Either you can make the decision on behalf of Joyce, or she can be active for a few minutes in the session and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once she is back from school.
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To choose a batch for the sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
26/09/23, 3:02 pm - +260 97 7632700: Monday and Thursday is fine

28/09/23, 2:08 pm - +260 97 7632700: Am fine
28/09/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Joyce has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help her to fund your higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build her personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
28/09/23, 2:23 pm - +260 97 7632700: Indeed we are on the same page.
28/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As per our discussion, Joyce will resume her EWYL Process after 22 November, 23. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
28/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how her involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking out time to complete these discussions, I really appreciate it.

How are you today?

I hope you are ready for today's session.
28/11/23, 2:01 pm - +260 771370508: Am OK how are you ma'am
28/11/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
28/11/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if everything is clear till this point.
28/11/23, 2:02 pm - +260 771370508: That's great
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - +260 771370508: Yes it is
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*JOYCE/ADITI/2023*
28/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
28/11/23, 2:08 pm - +260 771370508: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Application Form*

28/11/23, 2:11 pm - +260 771370508: So what am I supposed to do
28/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You are supposed to share this form in the group that you will creat and your aim would be to get this form filled out by interested students.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - +260 771370508: Ok
28/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/11/23, 2:27 pm - +260 771370508: Follow this link to join my WhatsApp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/EnYWHMANobn72oW5dkvTTL

28/11/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zambia, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month.

On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zambia, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

29/11/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
01/12/23, 2:33 pm - +260 771370508: Monday and Thursday ma'am

01/12/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

01/12/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
01/12/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
01/12/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 12:00- 1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:

01/12/23, 2:39 pm - +260 771370508: OK ma'am
01/12/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
01/12/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Joyce, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success.
