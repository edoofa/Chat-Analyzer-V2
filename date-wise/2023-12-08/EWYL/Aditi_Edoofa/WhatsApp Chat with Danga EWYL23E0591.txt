19/09/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Danga, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 387 2106: l am Mrs  Danga Evernices mother
19/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay 
My long term goals are to expand my knowledge,gain experience of my passionate job psychology so that l will be more experienced to take certain responsibilities as the nature of my job requires and most of all to obtain my degree in psychology

So the EWYL would help me to archive my goal through assisting me with financial services and it enables me to obtain skills which would help me later in future so these are some of the advantages of EWYL which would help me to archive my dreams
19/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That sounds great! Pursuing EWYL to support your long-term goals in psychology, gain experience, and obtain your degree makes a lot of sense. It's a valuable opportunity for both financial assistance and skill development to help you achieve your dreams.
19/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings ma'am!
I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Danga will learn a lot from this journey to success.
I can see that Danga is very lucky to have such supportive parents like you.
19/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course
19/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 387 2106: thank you we are supporting her
19/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that!
19/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 771 4290: No am not sure
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Thank you well understood
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 771 4290: I have read it
19/09/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
I hope to see you such email someday when you have earned a good amount of credits, okay?
19/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course I promise so and hope my journey will also be as good as this
19/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I will make sure that you have a smooth journey filled with learnings.
19/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
19/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 771 4290: I'm humbled to meet them and I believe it will be a great journey working with them
19/09/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you!
19/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
19/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes very interesting
19/09/23, 3:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

20/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Actually everything is good and teaching so it's difficult to differentiate
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I agree though did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Of course it is a great pleasurable moment
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Danga?
20/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Great and interesting
20/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

28/09/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon.
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
28/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes I am ready
28/09/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/09/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: In this session I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay go ahead l am waiting
28/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
28/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/09/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

28/09/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay l understand
28/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
28/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Well understood
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you have explained to the student as we have discussed right?
28/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Yes can l do it individualy or l can just share the information in the group
28/09/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You can do it in both ways according to the situation.
28/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay thank you
28/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay. <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
03/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay
03/10/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!

04/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Good afternoon
04/10/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
04/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 771 4290: I am well thank you ,yes we can begin
04/10/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
04/10/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
04/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Monday and Thursday is good
04/10/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
04/10/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
04/10/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
04/10/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
04/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay well understood
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
04/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay I understand
04/10/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.

04/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Is it possible to reschedule the session at 2pm because from 7 to 1:30 l will be at school
04/10/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, so Danga I have two time slots -

Second one from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

14/11/23, 10:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!

Wow, this is amazing.

Diwali is symbolic  on it's on as it's is a symbol of the power of goodness over evil so it's significance lies on it's symbolism of hope over despair,love and happiness ,the positive aspects of life

14/11/23, 12:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
15/11/23, 10:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I trust this message finds you in high spirits! 😊 I wanted to touch base regarding our missed session on Monday, and I hope you had a fantastic Diwali break.

Given the festive spirit, it seems our schedules got a bit tangled. No worries at all! How about we reschedule our session today between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM? 
Looking forward to connecting and picking up where we left off!
15/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 771 4290: Oh l am sorry today l won't be able to connect with you l have an exam at 1pm which I am preparing
15/11/23, 12:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand!
All the best Danga!
18/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 771 4290: As a young girl trying to make a name for herself life was always not fair.l was facing a range of challenges. I was struggling with poverty, dealing with gender-based discrimination, and facing prejudice based on my sexuality. The situation was taking a toll on my mental health and making me feel hopeless because l couldn't understand the difference between a male child and a female. Then, l had a moment of clarity. I realized that l will not let the challenges  l was facing define me but rather they would help me to prove everyone wrong that actually a child is a child

I began to advocate for myself and others who were facing similar challenges. I spoke out against discrimination and poverty by doing something for myself like archiving my grades and starting a small business for myself
18/11/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's incredibly inspiring! It takes a lot of courage to stand up for yourself and others, especially in the face of adversity. How did you go about advocating for yourself and addressing these challenges? Starting a small business and focusing on your education are powerful steps.

It's remarkable that you've turned your struggles into motivation to prove that a child is a child, regardless of gender. Could you share more about your journey and the impact you've seen so far? Advocacy and entrepreneurship can be powerful tools for change, and your story could inspire others facing similar challenges.
18/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 771 4290: Okay what l learnt in life is actions speaks so louder than words that it can reach to everyone's ears .So from the moment I realized that a girl child was given lesser value than a boy child l thought about what actually boys do that a girl cannot do and l realized that with determination there is nothing no one can't do be it a girl or a boy.So my first step was to make sure l archive something of my own and the easiest one was to come up with good grades atleast they allowed girls to study until the ordinary level ,then l asked my brother for money to start a small business that's selling sweets and it florished to the extent that l would help mother to buy some things at home,so when other parents saw this they actually realized that even a girl can do something of her own if only there is support
20/11/23, 10:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Danga!
Hope you are well.

So I appreciate you submitting your Activity but please ensure that you submit it on the EWYL Line only.
