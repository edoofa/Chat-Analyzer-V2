24/08/23, 12:56 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: *Dear Mentor, my name is Michelle Shalom Verina Mwanamai and my EWYL group name is Michelle EWYL23E0567.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
24/08/23, 1:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Michelle, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.
24/08/23, 1:03 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Pleased to meet you.
24/08/23, 1:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
24/08/23, 1:06 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I am greatly excited to begin this journey Ms Aditi, I anticipate great results working with you.
24/08/23, 1:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This is superb!
24/08/23, 1:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
24/08/23, 1:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 1:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once you have watched this video do share your thoughts on the same with me so that we can connect on a deeper level.
24/08/23, 1:17 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Yes ma'am I'm on it
24/08/23, 1:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
24/08/23, 1:29 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I am excited to start this journey with you, Ms Aditi. As you have stated, a mentor must be passionate about helping and developing their mentes, and I can feel the passion in you so I have a great feeling about this mentorship. Yes I understand that rewards are in form of credits and not money, and that makes me glad because I'll be able to reduce the money my parents have to pay for my education. As much as I love the idea of going abroad for school, I also love that I can make up for my education fees whilst self-developing and earning experience. I'm really happy I get to do this with you, let's jump in.
24/08/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
24/08/23, 2:06 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Great 👏
24/08/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I extend a warm welcome to you for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey and I can assure you that Michelle will learn a lot from this journey to success.
24/08/23, 2:13 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Thank you so much for the warm welcome! I'm thrilled to be a part of this EWYL journey and looking forward to the incredible experiences and learnings ahead for our daughter Michelle.
24/08/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, that is great.
24/08/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I can see that Michelle is very lucky to have such supportive parents like you.
24/08/23, 2:23 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: I am the dad, Kwakwarhi Mwanamai
24/08/23, 2:24 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: We are humbled 🙏
24/08/23, 2:25 pm - +265 999 89 35 86: Thank you
24/08/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am pleased to know you Sir and I welcome you to this journey as well.
24/08/23, 2:39 pm - +265 888 87 18 27: Thank you madam. As parents we can't hold our excitement to be part of an onboarding process for our first born daughter and only girl in the family.
24/08/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome! It's truly an exciting time for parents to be part of this, especially as  Michelle is the only girl in the family. Enjoy every moment of this special experience!
24/08/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Michelle, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
24/08/23, 3:00 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Thank you ma'am. So basically I strive to be a successful young lady either by day to day 9-5 work or business, or both. That is why I picked business administration because with the knowledge and skills embedded in me in this program, I can do my own thing or work with and around people for self development and a better future for myself and my family.
I feel like I wouldn't be satisfied with just a bachelor's degree, I want to earn good grades and work towards a master's degree afterwards. Depending on how things turn out, I may be able to mix school with a business or part time work, when striving for my master's. I believe I'm capable of achieving so much and making my parents proud, if I have the right attitude, and the right source of education, and that's where being an Edoofian comes through.
This EWYL program will be beneficial for me because as I am learning how to tackle the business world, I'll be gaining experience online and that can help me experience wise, and in personal development. This is so because knowing I have a job that's paying my fees is motivating and gives a sense of responsibility, as well as the feeling of knowing my parents' shoulders aren't overweighted. That's why I had no doubt when I was asked if I want to partake in this program.
24/08/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Wow I mean this is fantastic Michelle.
I am thrilled to see your ambitious nature and I am sure that you are going to make it big in life as you have a lot of potential and you possess an amazing sense of clarity I really adore that.
24/08/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This is from my side for today!
So we will resume our session tomorrow onwards from *2:00 PM to 3:00 PM* and your sessions will be held from *Monday to Friday*. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
As now you are an Edoofian, being punctual should be an inherent trait and I hope that as the clock strikes 2:00, you come for the sessions for your fruitful EWYL Journey.
24/08/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have a wonderful day ahead.
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Thank you!
24/08/23, 3:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood and agreed.
24/08/23, 3:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Likewise🫱🏼‍🫲🏽
25/08/23, 2:39 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I think I like the 3 quotes for you section. A short and quick form of motivation. More efficient because it's been put at the beginning of the letter. Gives you the eagerness to know more about what's been written. I surely enjoyed skimming through the letters.
25/08/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
25/08/23, 2:43 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Oh, Yes! I'd love to be adored by fellow Edoofians by the hand of founder. Another great form of motivation, so students strive to work better and earn a spot on the Hall of Inspiration.
25/08/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I am glad that you are motivated,
25/08/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Michelle?
25/08/23, 2:51 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: That sounds amazing. I'm really glad I chose to do this, I'm sure I won't regret and I'll have fun doing it.
25/08/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you will learn a lot as well and this is going to be a great experience for you.
25/08/23, 2:53 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Excited for it.
25/08/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
25/08/23, 2:55 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay fine, that's great.

Yes I'm ready.
25/08/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: - So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
25/08/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is all for today.
So we will resume our session Monday onwards from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM and your sessions will be held from Monday to Friday. 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then Have a great weekend!🌸
25/08/23, 3:03 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: On it
25/08/23, 3:04 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: 1. The EWYL program includes Ms. Deepali, who is the Head of the department. She monitors conversations and assists when necessary. She's known for her concern and interest in students.
There's also Ms. Davi who's the Head Coach. She'll be mentoring us through her curriculum.
They will both make sure that I achieve my desired skills through this program.
25/08/23, 3:04 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: 2. The goals that have been set for me by my mentor are: 
a) to help me as an Edoofian, self-finance my education as a way of supporting my parents and helping them pay off the rest of my fees by earning credits.
b) to give me an equal opportunity to develop 21st century skills and ensure that I'm equipped for employement.
25/08/23, 3:05 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: 3. Mr. Angad Singh interacts with students through the newsletter.
25/08/23, 3:07 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: 4. The hall of inspiration is a way of motivation and encouraging, as well as appraisal that the founder, Mr Angad Singh produces in his weekly newsletter. It is also a way of letting students know the multiple ways that they can build themselves personally and develop extra skills that may not be taught in class.
25/08/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This is Superb!
25/08/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We will now connect on Monday.

28/08/23, 2:56 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: The second project is community building.

The primary outcome is for students to build up networking skills and leverage Africans to join the Edoofian education system.
28/08/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the mistake Michelle, there was some misunderstanding from my end as I have one more student as Michelle, we will be beginning with your second project after completion of first project.

08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: #1. The Malawi University of Business and Applied Sciences.
It is not connected to Edoofa.
#2. I will share with them that I was able to land a scholarship with Edoofa, to pursue further high quality education, In India. And I am now trying to connect them so that others can have the chance like I did.
#3. It is located in Lilongwe, Malawi.
08/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
08/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
08/09/23, 2:24 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I do not have their contact, but I can ask around.
08/09/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay that would be great!
08/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
08/09/23, 2:25 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I promise
08/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good!

08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me share some important resources with you that you can share with the School Head.
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._
08/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

08/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
08/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Nice.
08/09/23, 2:42 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Oh okay, that makes sense
08/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes.
08/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Michelle- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
08/09/23, 2:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Small question with these applications. What if the person who wants to apply last wrote their MSCE in 2015 and haven't been in school since? You still consider them?
08/09/23, 2:44 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okayy
08/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, they can be considered if they are capable.
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I think we can proceed
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
08/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
08/09/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
08/09/23, 2:47 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I'm so excited, tell me already
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
08/09/23, 2:52 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
08/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday.

08/09/23, 4:33 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Thank you
11/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
11/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor.
11/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
11/09/23, 2:49 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Application, counselling and admission...
11/09/23, 2:49 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Just an idea
11/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You are almost correct.
11/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
11/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
11/09/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: I'm enlightened
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright, we're on the same page.
11/09/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
11/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session will be on Monday and Thursday from 12:00-1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
11/09/23, 2:58 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Okay great
11/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
11/09/23, 2:59 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Fantastic, for a second I thought there were deadlines so I was a bit tensed.
11/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: No, Michelle there are no deadlines.
11/09/23, 3:02 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Understood
11/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 
So now we will be having your sessions on the EWYL line and I would like you to follow the daily ritual irrespective of the fact if there is a session or not.

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
11/09/23, 3:04 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Thank you Ms. Enjoy the rest of your day‼️

07/11/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust this message finds you in good health. 

Since I am unavailable on Thursday due to some work, *I would like to schedule our Thursday session for tomorrow,*  from *9:30 AM to 11:00 AM.*
Your cooperation in rescheduling would be greatly appreciated. Kindly confirm your availability for the same.
07/11/23, 3:49 pm - +265 882 05 59 00: Alright ma'am, understood.

I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
