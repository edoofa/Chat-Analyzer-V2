 _Community Building_
This refers to the process of stabilizing and strengthening connections, relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community.
 👉This involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where students feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate, communicate and work towards common goals.
👉The role of the Community Building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.
👉The shared belief is the core of the second project which is community building.
The primary outcome is this project is for students to develop networking skills and to learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoofa's education ecosystem and acquire international education that prepares them for the future.
➡️By reaching out to personal extended networks, students will identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers and direct them to this opportunity.
👉 This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others.
👉 To successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their secondary schools or are currently in a final year of senior secondary education.
👉 As a member of the Edoofa team it will be expected of me to use my networking in persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help the organization group.
👉 Throughout the project Edoofa will provide a guidance and support to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts.
👉 For every student that enrols and pays up first part of the enrollment fee the referring student will receive $20 worth scholarship credits and upon completion of the admission formalities of the university, the referring student will receive $30 worth is scholarship credits!

05/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 166 8266: After the student fills in the form, do l send it in this group?
05/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 166 8266: Thank you
05/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 166 8266: Thus an effective way of drawing in students👏 <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes it is.
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

*Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:*
*"The best investment you can make is in yourself."*

This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.

So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.

06/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Now that the time is over, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session*.

2. I will use the Edoofa cover letter which you said you will provide

07/12/23, 2:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 166 8266: Yes
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
07/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 166 8266: Yes ma'am

07/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 166 8266: Thus mind-blowing👏
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
07/12/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
