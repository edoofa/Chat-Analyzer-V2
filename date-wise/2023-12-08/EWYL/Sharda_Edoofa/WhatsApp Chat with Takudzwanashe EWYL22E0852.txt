15/09/23, 9:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Takudzwanashe

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:21 pm - +44 7440 417555: How are you ma'am thank you so much so how best can we help as parents because Takudzwanashe is still at school
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am good. Thank you so much for asking.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - +44 7440 417555: Due to nature of our work l think l can consider Saturday ma'am

09/11/23, 11:00 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Tajudzwanashe
It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*
Kindly be available for the same. 
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

I hope this quote inspires a positive start to our session. Before we delve into our discussions, I'd like to learn more about you. Have you engaged in extracurricular activities such as debate, sports, singing, or competitions? If so, have you earned any accolades for your efforts? Excited to hear about your experiences!
21/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 772 9092: Yes l play football at school but l don't an accolade though
21/11/23, 8:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear that you play football at school! Participation in sports is not just about winning accolades; it's also about enjoying the game, staying active, and building valuable skills like teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Accolades are certainly a nice recognition of your efforts, but the most important thing is that you're having fun and gaining personal growth through your involvement in football. Keep playing, stay dedicated, and who knows, those accolades might come your way in the future. Remember, the journey and the experiences along the way are just as important as the destination.
21/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 772 9092: Thank you for the motivating words ma'am

Sharing of information about Edoofa scholarship using the group and also the mentor shud be present
21/11/23, 10:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done , I am impressed with your understanding.
21/11/23, 10:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
21/11/23, 10:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
21/11/23, 10:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/11/23, 8:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
22/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 772 9092: 1. The name of my school is Loreto and yes it is connected with Edoofa

3. My school is located in the province of Midlands
22/11/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
22/11/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
22/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 772 9092: Yes ma'am

22/11/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
22/11/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
