I hope you will be available for your EWYL after November 15th.
15/09/23, 9:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Uvyett

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That is indeed a great news. Looking forward to the session on saturday.
03/10/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Uvyett

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

14/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 210 4454: Her availability starts tomorrow after attending her last exam then back home
15/11/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Uvyett*

_Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
21/11/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 072 9798: I understand the credits

21/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 072 9798: To connect with them I create a group and share it in other groups tt have upper six students
21/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 072 9798: In this group I convey necessary information about edoof with my mentor also being a part of this group
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Uyvett, I am impressed with your understanding.
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is how you have to make sure that the application form is filled
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

23/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 072 9798: It would be necessary to explain to them how I joined edoofa and also how our journey so far has been
23/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 072 9798: I must be able to set up a way for the edoofian directors to communicate with the headmasters I would have talked to

06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Mitchell
*Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:*
*"The best investment you can make is in yourself."*

This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.

So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Uyvett, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will help you out.
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All. EDOOFA, initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in India, firmly believes that quality education should be accessible to all, irrespective of social or financial limitations.

School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs.

2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.

06/12/23, 2:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
06/12/23, 2:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
