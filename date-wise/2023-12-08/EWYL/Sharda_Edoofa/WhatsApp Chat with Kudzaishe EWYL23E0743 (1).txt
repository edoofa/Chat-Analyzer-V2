The Student's journey with Edoofa is bright.
I say so because Edoofa gives one a chance to attain higher education.
They find the best suitable universities for they students.

Unlike other schoolarship programs with Edoofa as a student I don't have to worry about affordability and Employability.

Throughout the journey Edoofa offers expert career counseling that will assist them in career growth.

The journey will be made easier as Edoofa assist with accommodation, food and other university expenses.

With Edoofa students become financially independent too.
06/10/23, 11:38 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Therefore this shows that with Edoofa the journey of students is bright.
06/10/23, 11:53 pm - +263 78 660 9547: 4) *Write in detail about one of the students testimonials*

I will use *Denzel Ndima's* testimony.
Denzel Ndina made a testimony thanking the the Edoofa board about they warmly support through out his journey.
Denzel stated that Edoofa is an excellent program with a vision to make affordable higher quality education available to all.

He noted down that Edoofa connected him with with the vision of education with practical knowledge through providing him with life changing opportunities.

Denzel seemed to be excited about the EWYL program which helped students become professionals, pioneers and leaders in their fields.

He also shared his experience with Edoofa and it read as follows" *Edoofa helped me to be a student with no fear in every single part of my life to be someone creative and not only this, as it also helped me to be a hard worker as well as a problem solver even sometimes when things when things got harder. "*

 *Denzel Ndima* went goes on to recommend other students to take Edoofa as a road to success,

That was a great testimony indeed.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
09/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Noted Ms Sharda
09/10/23, 12:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
09/10/23, 12:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
09/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Noted...
09/10/23, 12:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
09/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay following

09/10/23, 1:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
09/10/23, 1:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

09/10/23, 1:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
09/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 660 9547: It's hard to tell for me either but there is that quote by Bill Gates which caught my eye

It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure
09/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 660 9547: The story of Vinscent Irvine Chipanga is captivating
09/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 660 9547: I'm looking forwad to be receiving these newsletters
09/10/23, 1:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful Kudzaishe.

10/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay so I will simply create a Whatsap platform and Facebook where I will be helping other students join Edoofa
10/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Thank you I will get to it
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, but there is a process for the same and we will discuss the same.
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay that is wonderful.
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Okay so I will wait for that firstly before doing anything
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 12:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: No, you can start working on the projects once we are done discussing them.
10/10/23, 12:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly provide the understanding of the audio whenever you are free.
10/10/23, 12:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
10/10/23, 12:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
10/10/23, 12:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

12/10/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:
12/10/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
12/10/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
12/10/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Are you following the discussion Kudzaishe?*
12/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 660 9547: Afternoon

Ms Sharda can you please give me clarity about an *Excel file* i have no idea how it's done.
12/10/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Of course! Making an Excel file is like creating a digital table where you can organize information neatly. Here's an explaination
12/10/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Open Excel: First, open the Excel program on your computer. You can usually find it in your list of programs or by searching for "Excel."

    Create a New File: After opening Excel, you'll see a blank grid with rows and columns. This is where you can make your table.

    Enter Data: Click on a cell (those little boxes where rows and columns meet) and start typing. Each cell can hold text, numbers, or anything you want to organize. For example, you can put a list of your favorite books, your school grades, or even your savings.

    Format Your Table: You can make your table look nice by changing the fonts, colors, and adding borders. It's a bit like decorating your table to make it easier to read and understand.

    Save Your File: Don't forget to save your work! Click on "File" at the top left, then "Save As." You can give your file a name and choose where to save it on your computer.

    Keep Your File Safe: It's a good habit to save your Excel file regularly, so you don't lose your work. You can also make a backup copy on a USB drive or in the cloud.

That's it! Excel is a handy tool for many tasks, from school projects to organizing your personal information. Have fun exploring and creating your Excel files!

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

06/12/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
06/12/23, 4:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
06/12/23, 4:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 4:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
06/12/23, 4:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
06/12/23, 4:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
