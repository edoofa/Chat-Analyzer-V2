1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
24/11/23, 8:58 am - +27 84 448 3976: Ok
24/11/23, 8:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

I would like to remind you that *IT'S TIME FOR YOUR SESSION* 
So, are you ready?
30/11/23, 8:38 am - +27 63 355 4754: Yes
30/11/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
30/11/23, 8:39 am - +27 63 355 4754: Yes please
30/11/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 

Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
30/11/23, 8:41 am - +27 63 355 4754: Ok
30/11/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
30/11/23, 8:47 am - +27 63 355 4754: So  I need to create my occount now

30/11/23, 8:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
30/11/23, 8:54 am - +27 63 355 4754: Ok
30/11/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite!

30/11/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That’s awesome- Lenny, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
30/11/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?
30/11/23, 9:20 am - +27 63 355 4754: This project Also encourages you to adopt a mindset of identifying and openly sharing opportunities to make a positive impact in the lives of others .Furthermore ,to complete this project I need to connect with African Students who have recently graduated from Senior Secondary schools
30/11/23, 9:21 am - +27 63 355 4754: Thank you

01/12/23, 9:36 am - +27 63 355 4754: From the audio I heard that the most effective way through which I can execute our project 2 is that I have to create a WhatsApp  group and identifying the right students who can be the part of that group . I must also provide them with necessary information about Edoofa . To find the right students  I can start by getting in touch with my school mates who are currently in form 6 or those who have passed already . In that group , I will be sharing the information about the exciting opportunity to persue education in India with a guaranteed Scholarship.  I also should add you as our mentor before interacting with the students . The purpose of adding you is to track my progress and provide guidance in learning network skills  . I must ensure that the right information has been shared with the students.
