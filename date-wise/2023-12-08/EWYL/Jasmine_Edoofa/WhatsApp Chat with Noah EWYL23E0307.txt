I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
Kindly come on the EWYL LINE and type *LESSON*
Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement. So, *_We won't be having sessions on Monday_*

20/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 936 1239: A few months ago, I was working on a challenging project at my workplace. The deadline was fast approaching, and the workload seemed insurmountable. I realized that I needed to apply the principles of time management, hard work, and perseverance to overcome this adversity.With a determined mindset, I created a detailed schedule, prioritizing tasks and allocating specific time slots for each. I knew that staying organized and disciplined would be crucial for success. I dedicated extra hours, working late at night and even sacrificing personal time to complete the project.There were moments when I felt overwhelmed and doubted my abilities, but I reminded myself of the importance of perseverance. I pressed on, embracing the challenges as opportunities for growth. I sought guidance from experienced colleagues and incorporated their advice into my work strategy.

Despite the obstacles, I persevered and met the deadline, delivering quality results. Not only did I learn the importance of managing my time effectively, but I also witnessed the power of hard work and perseverance. My experience is a testament to the strength and resilience within our community, showing that we can overcome any obstacles by taking charge and remaining determined.
This incident taught me that when faced with adversity, we have the power to shape our own path. It's essential to apply time management skills, put in the hard work, and persevere through challenges, as they serve as stepping stones towards personal and professional growth.
