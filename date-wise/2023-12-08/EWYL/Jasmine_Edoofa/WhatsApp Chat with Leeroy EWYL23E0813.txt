Edoofa students have worked with over 50 brands in the past 2 years, resulting in 3X growth for organisations in terms of online visibility, social media presence and greater market access. 

2. The EWYL program is the backbone of the Edoofa and unique aspect of the whole program.  It is a program in which students are given real-time live online projects during which they will gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits. However the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable

4. This is kurainashe's testimonial " it is It is an Edoofa initiative which helps students to earn scholarship credits through undertaking tasks with the Earn While You Learn Program run by SEELs which is an abbreviation for Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success. These are online tasks and they include social media marketing, market research, blogging, article writing, and online projects as well. This has helped me in improving my article writing skills and marketing skills. It has even enlarged my knowledge of the business world. The online tasks don’t even affect my learning because I just have to spare like 1-2 hours a day for the tasks. The SEELs program has helped me in paying my fees as I earn monthly credits, so it has helped me financially. Entrepreneurship is the core of today's business and the SEELs program has helped me understand that investment is better than a salary because with a salary you can purchase goodies but with investment you build a fortune ."

28/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 702 0188: Thank you Ms Jasmine
28/10/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the EWYL team.

In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
28/10/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 702 0188: I understand
28/10/23, 8:30 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
28/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am
28/10/23, 8:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
28/10/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am I'm listening
28/10/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
28/10/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK Ms Jasmine I think I'm OK with the timing
28/10/23, 8:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
28/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am
28/10/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

28/10/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Leeroy, Don't worry once we are done with the initial orientation. You wll receive them weekly.
28/10/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
28/10/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 702 0188: School life is not all about academics, games, friends, and fun. In fact, it is also
about learning to interact with other people, being aware of the social
issues/inequities, and learning to amend the deformities present in our society.
The fact is that you are never too young or immature to start making a
difference in the community and tackling social issues.
28/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 702 0188: I have posted one of the quotes on my status "you will never change your life until you change something you do daily"
28/10/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is indeed a powerful reminder that even small, consistent actions can lead to meaningful change. It's a great source of inspiration for self-improvement and making a difference in the world.
28/10/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
28/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 702 0188: Yes it's clear
28/10/23, 9:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/10/23, 9:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3? <This message was edited>
29/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 702 0188: 1. Project 1 is the Corporate Alliance 

Project 2 is the Community Building 

And project 3 is African Schools Education Reform Mission 

2. From project 1 Edoofians have to connect with different kinds of companies to build a network of partner companies and potential employees. This will help create a strong professional network and earn scholarship credits. The student will have to identify local companies and also identify the decision makers who work in these companies 

3. From project 2 ,students will have to reach out to their professional and extended networks and offer them an opportunity to be part of Edoofa's Educational ecosystem and acquire international education which prepare them for the future 

4. From project 3 I understand that students will reach out to reach out to local schools in their local region and will speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. This is a non commercial tie up where Edoofa wants to help by sharing world class technology and also career counselling and sharing courses and scholarships opportunities with high school students

01/11/23, 8:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
01/11/23, 8:21 am - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am
01/11/23, 8:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 

Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
01/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am I've just downloaded LinkedIn app from play store
01/11/23, 8:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
01/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 702 0188: No questions for now ma'am
01/11/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
01/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am I'm listening
01/11/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Leeroy!
01/11/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am I'm done with the audio
01/11/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please share your undersatndings.
01/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 702 0188: On this project I am tasked to reach out to African students who have graduated high school or who are in their final year to join Edoofa's Educational ecosystem and acquire international education . This project will also encourage me to adapt the mindset of openly sharing opportunities to make a positive impact in the lives of others
01/11/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Leeroy, I am impressed with your understanding. 

While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
01/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 702 0188: I understand
01/11/23, 9:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

01/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 702 0188: So Ms Jasmine, I'm supposed to fill out this form then I will have to reach out to people and then send it to them?
01/11/23, 10:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No dear, This is an example on how you can reach out to the students.
02/11/23, 12:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening,* ☺️

08/11/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 702 0188: Q1. Seke 4 high school 

Q2 . I am Leeroy a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  

Q3. Seke 4 High school is in Harare chitungwiza
08/11/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 9:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
09/11/23, 10:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As we conclude for the day, I'd like to inform you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all are looking forward to celebrating Diwali with our family and this is why our next session is scheduled for Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
09/11/23, 11:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

15/11/23, 8:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
15/11/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 702 0188: What is that professional touch ma'am
15/11/23, 8:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I will be helping you with the messages Leeroy.

15/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK Ms Jasmine
15/11/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
15/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 702 0188: Oh ....I see
15/11/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

21/11/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time we were discussing Project 3. Do you remember?
21/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 702 0188: . Yes I remember clearly
21/11/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Leeroy- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
21/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Ms Jasmine....project 1 Corporate Alliance
21/11/23, 8:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: What do you want to know about it?
21/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 702 0188: Am I supposed to be looking for specific companies like companies that only do engineering or I can search for any companies
21/11/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No Leeroy, you can look for any company but I hope you know that Corporate Alliance project is on hold currently.
21/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am right now we are only dealing with project 2 and 3 . On project 2 community building I didn't quite understand when you said I should only search for partnership with schools with fees above $100 . Does this mean if their school fee is less that this preferred amount I should let go and look for other schools
21/11/23, 9:22 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Project 3 is the African Schools Education Reform Mission, where you have to visit schools whose fees is more than 100$
21/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK and if its less than that I should ignore the school
21/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You don't need to disregard it; instead, you can connect with the students from that school and perform community building.
21/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am
21/11/23, 9:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey

21/11/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
21/11/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
