I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 948 2231: Sure


Thank you
15/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 948 2231: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday 1.30 to 230
05/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 948 2231: Hi
05/10/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Olivia
How are you doing?
05/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 948 2231: I'm good how are you
05/10/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
05/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Olivia may I know if can we connect tomorrow at 2:00 pm for the session. I was us to complete the introduction.
05/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 948 2231: Oky
05/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 948 2231: Noted
06/10/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
May I know that are you available for the session now?
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,
I hope you are doing well. 

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
12/10/23, 1:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
12/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 948 2231: I'm starting my exams on Monday
12/10/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I understand your concern. Could you please consider participating in the session for the initial 30 minutes? This way, we can complete the basic introduction. Once that's accomplished, you can officially pause the sessions and then resume them after you've completed your exams. Does this arrangement work for you?
12/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 948 2231: We can rearrange the sessions
12/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 948 2231: We can start on 15 November
12/10/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, but before that I want you to have a session with me for 30 minutes.
13/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 948 2231: Oky.. Will try
13/10/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,
So, are you currently available for the session?
16/10/23, 8:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Olivia and Parents* @263789482231 @263772857250 @263780957216 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
18/10/23, 10:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @263789482231 @263772857250 @263780957216*
It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Olivia*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Olivia* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly.
18/10/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 285 7250: Ok mostly I will out of network may u connect her after exams on the tenth of november
21/10/23, 5:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I hope you are in good health. *IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*
May I know are you available?
26/10/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Waiting for this message
09/11/23, 10:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings of the day, 
It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

I hope this message finds you in great spirits after the Diwali break! Let's use this post-Diwali phase to illuminate our minds with newfound knowledge, enthusiasm, and a commitment to excellence. Just as the diyas 🪔 light up the darkest corners, let our collective efforts brighten the path to success.

Now, *I would like to remind you that we have our session scheduled for today from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm*
Ensure you are on time so we can utilize each minute of the session wisely. ☺️
06/12/23, 9:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have noticed that it's been a while since you have attended any session. I am really worried. I hope you are okay. 
 
*In the end I would like to remind you that you have your sessions from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm.* Make sure that are very active during this time. If you feel that there are network challenges or any other challenge that will stop you from attending the sssion. Please solve it beforehand by arranging a hotspot connection or a wifi. 
I would really appreciate if we could have the maximum benefit during these 60 minutes. 

Now, I will see you tomorrow.  
Till then take care and a very Goodnight!
07/12/23, 1:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon Olivia*_
I hope you are doing well and you are in great spirits

It's time for our session.
