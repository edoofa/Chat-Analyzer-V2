You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would like to have session on this.
16/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 690 5967: Okay ma'am
16/08/23, 2:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 690 5967: Yes I'm ready
16/08/23, 3:23 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 690 5967: Okay
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 690 5967: I'm not really sure
16/08/23, 3:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion has not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 690 5967: Oh okay that's great
16/08/23, 3:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 690 5967: The PDF you sent me is not opening, I don't know sure why so maybe you can send it again
16/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 690 5967: That's great
16/08/23, 3:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 3:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 690 5967: Thank you, it opened
16/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 690 5967: Okay ma'am
