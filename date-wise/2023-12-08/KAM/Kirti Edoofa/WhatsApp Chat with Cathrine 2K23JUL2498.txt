04/08/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/08/23, 8:26 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes we can start.
04/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 8:46 pm - +48 574 536 864: Have gone through the image.
04/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/08/23, 8:56 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes they are clear.
04/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 9:00 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes, I am following
04/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Following
04/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/08/23, 9:25 pm - +48 574 536 864: Very Clear
04/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
04/08/23, 9:28 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes we can proceed
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
04/08/23, 9:43 pm - +48 574 536 864: I am proposing Sunday if it is within the timelines. Preferably 8PM CAT or even earlier than that it's fine.
04/08/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let us reconnect on Monday at 09.00 PM. I hope you will be available.
08/08/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Cathrine.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier as one of the batches of Edoofians was arriving in India yesterday and we were there waiting for their arrival at the airport hence we could not connect with you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
08/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
08/08/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
08/08/23, 5:58 pm - +48 574 536 864: Indeed that's the impression I got, you have clearly articulated the same. Apology my network has been bad.
08/08/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand network can be an issue. May I know if we are still connected with each other?
08/08/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Yes we can still proceed
08/08/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
08/08/23, 7:55 pm - +48 574 536 864: That's okay, we can proceed we are connected
08/08/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
08/08/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
08/08/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

The business process management life circle is comprised of five phases namely design, modelling, execution, monitoring, and optimization.  Each of the phases of the life circle  builds on the previous one and the result is an efficient and effective business process management system that meets the needs of the business.

Business process management is a systematic approach. When you start design, usually there are few stakeholders and processes. It is easy to lay out the business processes and execute then everyday  during expansion the process begin to fall into the predictable patterns. The second stage is model, this is represented in a digital format for teams to visualise the workfkow engine to understand instructions. Once the process is mapped and illustrated the process for easy consumption, the next stage is now execution. There is need to run them in a testing environment or by a small group before deploying I full scale.
For sustained process compliance, there is need for monitoring processes all the times. When the process is monitored and reviewed in real time, this helps to prevent potential setbacks and improve the  efficiency. With a proper monitoring system in place, operations can be driven towards optimization and process improvement. That's the business process management life circle.

09/08/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Cathrine.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
09/08/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
09/08/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Business Administration, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
09/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Noted with thanks
09/08/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 492 8058: This message was deleted
09/08/23, 9:48 pm - +48 574 536 864: Thank you for the feedback.
09/08/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes that is correct
09/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
09/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes l am ready
09/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
09/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
09/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes true studying in multiple universities  is not practical
09/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
09/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
09/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
09/08/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes he did
09/08/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Okay noted
09/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
09/08/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes clearly understood
09/08/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
09/08/23, 10:19 pm - +48 574 536 864: Well understood
09/08/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
09/08/23, 10:25 pm - +48 574 536 864: We are following and information is very clear
09/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
09/08/23, 10:28 pm - +48 574 536 864: Everything is clear
09/08/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
09/08/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Ok sir

17/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No need to apologize. I understand that everyone has busy schedules, especially during exam periods. It's important that Catherine focuses on her exams.

17/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Yes
17/10/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?

So, the balance fee will have to paid after coming to India.
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.
I hope I have answered the question correctly
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
17/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 552 5507: No queries or concerns at the moment all is clear and understood
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Okay noted yes we will be waiting that is good news to us
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Thank you
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
18/10/23, 7:00 am - +263 77 552 5507: Goodmorning Yes 12:30 I will try avail myself
18/10/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Cathrine.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
18/10/23, 3:36 pm - +48 574 536 864: Good Afternoon, I am available
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the benefits above?
18/10/23, 3:39 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes I have gone through the benefits
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Cathrine, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 3:44 pm - +48 574 536 864: That's awesome. We are very much excited
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - +48 574 536 864: That's very clear and well understood
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Afternoon my sincere apologies we have no electricity since morning hence network challenges
18/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that the network can be a challenge.
18/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 4:32 pm - +48 574 536 864: It's clear and well understood. This demonstrate the highest level by your institution to empower the generation with the requisite life changing skills.
18/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 4:36 pm - +48 574 536 864: So far it's clear and well understood.
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 4:38 pm - +48 574 536 864: Kindly provide more information about this
18/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
18/10/23, 4:43 pm - +48 574 536 864: It's now clear and well understood
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/10/23, 4:47 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes that's right.
18/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Understood
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 5:06 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes, I agree with the options
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - +48 574 536 864: That's very clear
18/10/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 5:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Cathrine.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263774928058 @48574536864?
19/10/23, 12:56 pm - +48 574 536 864: Goof afternoon, yes we can proceed
19/10/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 1:03 pm - +48 574 536 864: Following and its very clear
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 1:05 pm - +48 574 536 864: So far no queries
19/10/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Cathrine's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that cathrine is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 1:11 pm - +48 574 536 864: I am more than excited about this and committed to secure the  her seat
19/10/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 1:16 pm - +48 574 536 864: Thank you so much, we wish you a blessed day too and we look forward to receive the offer letter
07/11/23, 11:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
07/11/23, 11:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Cathrine,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
07/11/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

07/11/23, 11:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 552 5507: Goodmorning we are doing well thank you
08/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 552 5507: Oh we are so happy and pleased to hear this👏👏👏

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you were able to acknowledge the offer letter and I am happy to see your enthusiasm. I am looking forward to connecting with you at 07:30 pm, Congratulations to you and your family again.
08/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Thank you 😊
08/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
08/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
08/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Good evening my apologies we have noelectricity while  Catherineis at schoo
08/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that electricity can be a challenge, and she must be occupied at school. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/11/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!
09/11/23, 10:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Cathrine.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 552 5507: Good morning yes we can try now I am available
09/11/23, 10:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
09/11/23, 10:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
09/11/23, 12:15 pm - +48 574 536 864: Responses 
1. It's USD 900
2. Duration is 3 years
3. Admission and procedure is USD 300
4. Registration fee is USD 750
09/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
09/11/23, 12:30 pm - +48 574 536 864: It is very clear. Thank you
09/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
09/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
09/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
09/11/23, 12:38 pm - +48 574 536 864: That is very clear
09/11/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
09/11/23, 12:50 pm - +48 574 536 864: It is very clear and indeed the university has a student centred approach when it comes to accommodation
09/11/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
09/11/23, 12:53 pm - +48 574 536 864: It is very clear. Thank you
09/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
09/11/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
09/11/23, 12:58 pm - +48 574 536 864: That's fine, was however thinking that the deadline would be on the 27th of November since we received the letter through you on this platform. We are yet to receive it via email. But we take note of the deadline.
09/11/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand even after you get the offer letter through mail the only official conversation you will be having is through us and the letter we shared is of the exact equivalent, please. And the deadline is counted from the day we have shared the letter, may I know if you are clear so far?
09/11/23, 1:17 pm - +48 574 536 864: It's very clear now. Thank you so much
09/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
09/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
09/11/23, 1:30 pm - +48 574 536 864: We are in agreement and its very clear
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
09/11/23, 2:04 pm - +48 574 536 864: I reside in Mutare.
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
09/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - +48 574 536 864: Thank you for the details. We will connect with him so that we meet the deadlines
09/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
09/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's Ecocash for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - +48 574 536 864: You can provide the account details once more
09/11/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me do so:

Here are the Mukuru account details

09/11/23, 2:31 pm - +48 574 536 864: Thank you for the Information
09/11/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - +48 574 536 864: Very clear
11/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

14/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Our sincere apology once again we did not have electricity

14/11/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that electricity can be a challenge, however, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Cathrine.

I hope you are doing well. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply. I understand that you must be occupied with your work, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
15/11/23, 4:26 pm - +48 574 536 864: Good afternoon, Sincere apologies I am available but network connectivity has been a bigger challenge. I travelled to a mountainous district and the destination has network challenge connectivity.
15/11/23, 5:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that the network can be a challenge, however, please I would encourage someone from the family to attend the discussion since it is a very important discussion.
15/11/23, 6:30 pm - +48 574 536 864: That's very correct.
15/11/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/11/23, 6:34 pm - +48 574 536 864: Yes I am available
15/11/23, 6:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were clear so far?
15/11/23, 6:37 pm - +48 574 536 864: So far it's very clear
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 492 8058: YesI have clearly   understood
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Please  it's Catherine's mum
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how she can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes I  understand
15/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the her of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Noted yes I believe  she will be resuming on that programme  anytime soon now that her exams are over
15/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 492 8058: No questions  ,no queries  we can proceed.
15/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

15/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Noted
15/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
15/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
15/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
15/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 492 8058: So far  we have the letter asthe parents and now  Catherine  is back  from  school we intend to share it with her and discuss  with her

15/11/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, that is why I have given you the time that you need to discuss as a family.

Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
18/11/23, 3:24 pm - +48 574 536 864: That's in order. Thank you so much
18/11/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
20/11/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Cathrine!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 492 8058: My apologies my network is poor 
Yes  we did
20/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however, since our available hours for today are now over, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
20/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes l will be available
20/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great night
20/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Same to you
21/11/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Cathrine,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Good day 
Yes we can continue
21/11/23, 1:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
21/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 552 5507: Aftrnoon yes we did and we are happy about it
21/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
21/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 492 8058: OK we just want to know are there any other options or offer letters from different universities so that we can choose
21/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
21/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
21/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
21/11/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
21/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes l understand
21/11/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
21/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 492 8058: I wasn't aware
21/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias  without risking losing out on the scholarship.
21/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
21/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 492 8058: I only know OPU which have been accommodating more Zimbabweans
21/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 492 8058: OK no problem with that
21/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes l understand now
21/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Stay assured LPU is also one of our associated universities, and we have shared Cathrine's application there as well, once we get any update we shall let you know.
21/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Noted
21/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
21/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 492 8058: No questions, we can proceed
21/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
21/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Yes l did
21/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
21/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
21/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

As the university has set a deadline of November 22, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
21/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 492 8058: My parents are not around,  they have to  attend a funeral.
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting  me know that and I am sorry to hear that they have to attend a funeral, may I know by when can I expect to connect with them since tomorrow is your first deadline, hence it is time sensitive matter as well?

Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $750 - $150 = $600

Payment Mode Used: Mr. Shorwi EcoCash
