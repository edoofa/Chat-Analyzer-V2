01/08/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents Ecclesiastic.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us, may I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents?
02/08/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes
02/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes l am ready
02/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
02/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
02/08/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/08/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes
02/08/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
02/08/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
02/08/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
02/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes he has already explained the issue
02/08/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
02/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes
02/08/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
02/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes sir
02/08/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes
02/08/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
02/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 674 6066: As for now l don't have  queries
02/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
02/08/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Okay
03/08/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Ecclesiastic.

30/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 247 3573: As you have said ,the first step includes the message from the founder's office whereby  students would be given series of videos for them to have more clarity on being an Edoofian , qualities of being an Edoofian aligning with Edoofa's vision and many more .In addition , we  have step two whereby the student is supposed to write the statement of purpose.The SOP is the only subjective document that allows a student to convince the admission board .Step three looks at counselling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship whereby the academic board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights. The fourth step includes offer letter from the University.Last but no least ,there is a fifth step which is concerned about registration and admission acceptance letter.Once a student receives that letter in his/her hands  he /she can reserve a seat with the university  by paying registration fee.The last step is the VISA application .
30/10/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?

30/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
30/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
30/10/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

31/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Ecclesiastic, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
31/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Okay
31/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
31/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes
31/10/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
31/10/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ecclesiastic.

I hope you are doing well. I was eagerly anticipating a response, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, despite my observation that you've viewed my earlier message. May I kindly inquire if our communication is still ongoing?
01/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 361 4863: I'm fine and how are you..


Yes let's talk
01/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Amazing, may I know if you are clear so far?
01/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes I understand
01/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes  . and I don't have anything to add....
01/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 361 4863: But  notify me  the actual dates to pay fees  on time
01/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand. However, every university has its own deadline. So letting you know the exact dates is not possible for me, please.
01/11/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
01/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok
01/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through my message above?
01/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 361 4863: We discuss tomorrow.
01/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand you well here, are you referring to connecting tomorrow?
01/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes
01/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we can continue however, the discussion will not take much of your time if you are actively present right now.
01/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok let's continue
01/11/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are clear so far?
01/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes
01/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Network failure to connect
01/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
01/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
01/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok
01/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 361 4863: I understand
01/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 361 4863: That's clear
01/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok
01/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes
01/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 361 4863: How many points  do you want to a student to earn higher education
01/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand to achieve a high quantum of scholarship you would need an extremely good merit like 14-15 points in A- level.
01/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok thank you
01/11/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes I agree
01/11/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/11/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok
01/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 361 4863: That's clear
01/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
01/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Diploma  it takes many year and I continue with bachelor degree for how many year
01/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: diploma is a 3 year course, and degree is also a 3 year course.
01/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok I understand now
01/11/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
01/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes I get the sense
01/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 361 4863: I want to ask about $ 600 .... I'm going to pay each and every team  or what
01/11/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please you will be paying the registration fee for the first year only, not every term.
01/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok thanks now I know the direction
01/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Now you can proceed
01/11/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Ecclesiastic's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Ecclesiastic is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
01/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Yes
01/11/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
01/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 361 4863: 3 to 5 days from now or
01/11/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3-5 days will be just the application evaluation time, the offer letter can take a week or more time, to generate since every university has its own time.
01/11/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 361 4863: Ok I'm wait
02/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Good afternoon
02/11/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ecclesiastic.

02/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 674 6066: No , l just wanted to know how is your day progressing
02/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your asking, my day is going good, I really appreciate it.
27/11/23, 10:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Ecclesiastic,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

27/11/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 674 6066: Good morning I'm very sorry l failed to reply you yesterday
28/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 674 6066: On the issue of schedule time may you please reduce your time because l walk about a kilometer in search of network so it would be difficult for me to go during the night alone.
28/11/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ecclesiastic.

I hope you are doing well. I am glad to know that you have acknowledged the message, and thank you for letting me know that, may I know by when will you be able to connect?

28/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 674 6066: We can connect that time
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are available to connect now and move ahead with the discussion?
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes l am available
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Thank you
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 674 6066: My family is very excited with this achievement
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes l go through it
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Okay
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
28/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 674 6066: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$125
5.$1000
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes this made everyone here to be  happy as my higher education is now affordable
28/11/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
28/11/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
28/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Okay
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes I have gone through it
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 674 6066: May l know what is the meaning of the abbreviation of the university you gave me
28/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
28/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, EDB stands for the Education Bureau, may I know if you are clear?
28/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Not yet
28/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 674 6066: I mean MVN
28/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Okay
28/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: MVN University is the short name for Modern Vidya Niketan University.
28/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Okay thank you
28/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
28/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Can you further shade light on this
28/11/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
28/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
28/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Okay  ,now I understand
28/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
28/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
28/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
28/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 674 6066: I prefer a scholarship offer that allows me to save at least$850 annually
28/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 674 6066: I agree
28/11/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
28/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes,it is clear
28/11/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 11, 2023*.
28/11/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Is this transaction only be done using FBC bank or l can even use any bank nearer to my station
28/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes
28/11/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please do not worry be would be sharing the payment modes with you as well.
28/11/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *December 11, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *January 11 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date). <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before December 11, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Yes it's clear
28/11/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/11/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 674 6066: No l live in Gutu which is under Masingo province
28/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/11/23, 4:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 674 6066: Thank you l think this could be the best way to pay up the money
28/11/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
28/11/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 674 6066: I think I can try to reach Mr.Rajan because some of my relatives stay in Harare
28/11/23, 4:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, in that case, let me share the details just in case if you need them:

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited

Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
28/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263716746066 May I know if we are still connected since it has been an hour since I was waiting for you to respond?
