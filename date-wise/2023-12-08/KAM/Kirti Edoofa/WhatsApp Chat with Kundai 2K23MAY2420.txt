I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes it is maam
18/10/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 221 0106: K maam
18/10/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 221 0106: The first step was to get a message from the founders of Edoofa  like mister Angaad
18/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Second step I got my stament of purpose from the founders of edoofa
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Third step l got my counselling  session  from Mr Austin on my university  admission
18/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Step number 4 is the one l am waiting  for to receive offer letters from colleges anf universities
18/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Step number  5 is for me to register in university  and to receive  my admission acceptance  letter
18/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Then step number 6 is the visa application  process and for my departure to India
18/10/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 10:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 7:34 am - +263 71 221 0106: Mrng maam
19/10/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kundai.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress?
19/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes we are
19/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes we are maam
19/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 221 0106: K maam
19/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes l maam
19/10/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 221 0106: We can proceed
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Kundai, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 221 0106: K maam
19/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 221 0106: K maam
19/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes maam
19/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes maam
19/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes ma
19/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Maam
19/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 221 0106: No l am mmaaam
19/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are aware. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
19/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes maam
19/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yess
19/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 221 0106: K
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes l am
19/10/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Ohhhh ok
19/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 221 0106: No maam
19/10/23, 1:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Yes maam
19/10/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 221 0106: K maam
19/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 221 0106: Have a nyc day
07/11/23, 10:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Kundai,

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 5:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes l am maaam
08/11/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 681 8631: K
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the above questions.
08/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 681 8631: My semester tuition fee after scholarship is $900
08/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 78 681 8631: My standard duration of my course is 3 years
08/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 78 681 8631: My admission procedure fee is $ 300
08/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 681 8631: The registration fee apart from  total fee is $750
08/11/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes ma'am so this means l am going to pay $900 for my tution
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.  I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ma'am l will go with option number two as l have seen that it is affordable
08/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that all our Edoofians prefer to stay off- campus. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes so on transportation is it that l will have to find my own transport to go to school or the university will provide it for us
08/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your concern here. The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well?
08/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 681 8631: As it  is Maam
08/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
08/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes l am maam
08/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
08/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ohhh k l am delighted
08/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes we are
08/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ma'am what if we are not able to pay within 15 days because of the financial problems here in Zimbabwe
08/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we are together so far. Since the letter has been issued by the university the deadline stated is from the university as well, we a student/ parent does not follow them the university shall revoke the offer letter, however, if you openly communicated with us regarding your challenges, maybe the academic board can consider giving extension if they considered your reasons genuine.
08/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes Maam you can
08/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Thank you for that ma'am l appreciate
08/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ohhh k ma'am now l understnd
08/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes ma'am l reside in Harare
08/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ohh k thank you maam
08/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charle's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ma'am l think we can use Mr rajan cause it seems his transfer rate is cheaper than Mr Charles
08/11/23, 7:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please you can use it according to your choice. Let me just share the details for reference if you need them.

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
08/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 681 8631: K maam
08/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
08/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 681 8631: K continue maam
08/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
08/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
08/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes l do
08/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ma'am l wanted to ask that on my tuition fee am l not supposed to pay $900 after my scholarship so does that mean l have yet got my scholarship
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786818631 you are to pay $900 per semester please, since a year is made of 2 semesters, hence making your annual fee (900*2= $1800)
08/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Ohhh l understnd now
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
08/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Yes maam
08/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
08/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
08/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 681 8631: Noo don't have questions you have helped me to understand this letter better
08/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood everything really well. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

08/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
08/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

08/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. These resources are designed to help you familiarize yourself with the university and its academic environment, even when physical visits are not possible.
08/11/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday the 14th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 681 8631: K maam
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will be connecting on the 14th since we have one of the biggest festivals coming up *Diwali*, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?

Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
15/11/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Kundai.

I hope you are doing well. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply. I understand that you must be occupied with your work, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation.
