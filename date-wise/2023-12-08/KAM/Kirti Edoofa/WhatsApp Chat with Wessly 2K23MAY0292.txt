21/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon lm having network challenges.
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I'm available
21/10/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 761 2163: For admission process there were interview questions which were sent to Wessly and answered the questions.  Then his answers and application letter will be send to multiple universities and then they will respond after a while. In the event that multiple universities offered him a vacant . They will send offer letters outlining his scholarship amount, annual  tuition fee and accommodation fee, as well as his University registration fee. Wessly will choose one and then the parent will be required to pay the university registration fee. The registration fee that a student pays will be the part of first year tuition fee.
21/10/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 761 2163: For now l do not have queries maybe  until we get to  the bottom of it.
21/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

23/10/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Wessly,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
24/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Waiting for this message
24/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Waal that's great l wish you a happy and enjoyable Dusherra. Have a wonderful  day.
25/10/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Wessly,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. Thank you for your wishes. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I have understood my question is different what about if the student  to change the course like Changing from Mechanical Engineering to Aerospace Engineering is it possible.
25/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible to change your course from Mechanical Engineering to Aerospace Engineering.
25/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well thanks so much so when do the student switch?
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: There is not time as such, please when the student is ready and had a discussion with the parents regarding the same, the student can let us know.
25/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Alright it's fine.
25/10/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
25/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes it's clear now
25/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Explain further l want to know more
25/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
25/10/23, 6:10 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I have understood you can proceed to the last three points.
25/10/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes
25/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes l agree
25/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 10:18 pm - +263 71 761 2163: It's clear
25/10/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 11:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
06/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon. I hope everything is well. How long can l wait to receive the offer letter from the University.
06/11/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Wessly.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, everything is really well. I completely understand your concern here. This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well thanks for updating me.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes l have understood
15/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes l have understood so it means off campus accommodation is wiser
15/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please all of our Edoofians prefer to stay off campus. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well l have understand.
15/11/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes l have noted that so it means it shld be paid before writing their exams
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. However, as we move ahead you'll get a better clarity as well. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes we are together so $750 is included on tuition fee is that so
15/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please this $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
15/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes l have understood well
15/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 761 2163: So how much am l going to pay per semester
15/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 71 761 2163: And can l ask you a question.  Is Galgotias a very good University .
15/11/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263717612163 as I mentioned above during the end of the discussion all your queries shall be answered, and we will be sharing the university insights with you as well, please.
15/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well it's fine let's continue with the discussion
15/11/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes elaborate further
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes this is clear and how do l apply for that grant
15/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 761 2163: At Galgotias University do they offer  Aerospace Engineering
15/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No Wessly, Galgotias University does not currently offer the Aerospace Engineering course. This particular field of study is a niche one, which requires extensive infrastructure and facilities to adequately support students in their learning journey.
15/11/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Due to the specialized nature of Aerospace Engineering, career opportunities are somewhat limited to specific industries, only a select number of universities, such as Lovely Professional University (One of the top 5 universities in India), choose to provide this course. While Galgotias University is one of the top 100 universities in India, they are not one of them that chooses to offer the same course.
15/11/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In universities like LPU, where Aerospace Engineering is offered, the availability of scholarship seats is restricted. Typically, these universities only offer a scholarship of around 30%. However, we at Edoofa have diligently worked to secure a higher scholarship of 50% for the eligible students. 

With this consideration, the approximate annual cost of education for Aerospace Engineering would be around $3700 compared to $3000 for Mechanical Engineering at Galgotias (I will help you understand the breakup better as we move forward with our discussion). I hope this addresses the query you had?
15/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well  he wanted to switch to Aerospace University
15/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I have understood what you have said
15/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Is there any chances for that in other universities
15/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well we will hear from him as he arrives. Don't Crack your head towards this mater.
15/11/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, could you please help me understand why Wessly is inclined to pursue Aerospace engineering?
16/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Wessly,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?

16/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 761 2163: When he chose mechanical engineering, he had two options in his mind and he was not very sure of which one to pursue. He was also comparing the two courses in terms of the salaries.
16/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 761 2163: If it's complicated to switch to Aerospace engineering, he is working to continue with mechanical engineering.
16/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to.

17/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now since you mentioned yesterday that he had two options in mind and just comparing the courses in terms of salaries, he still opted for mechanical engineering, so I am not able to understand why is he now inclined towards aerospace engineering, may be you can help me understand better @263717612163?
17/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon.  He developed more interest in Aerospace Engineering
17/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that however, could you help me understand which factor apart form interests lead to his inclination towards Aerospace Engineering?
17/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Inspiration from his uncle.
17/11/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

18/11/23, 10:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing better may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 761 2163: We can connect
18/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now coming back to our discussion from yesterday since you mentioned his inspiration from his uncle could you please help me know more about his uncle and how he managed to inspire Wessly in Aerospace engineering.
18/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 761 2163: His uncle did civil engineering and his son mechanical engineering.  He was working in South Africa and back to Zimbabwe most of the time he is working out of Zimbabwe .And he had seen more opportunities in Aerospace Engineering and encouraging him to do something different in the family .
18/11/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, however, I was hoping to get a response early since today is Saturday and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect on Monday. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
18/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you so much same to you
18/11/23, 3:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
20/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Wessly.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
20/11/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response, however you did not response, since our available hours for today are over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
20/11/23, 11:00 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good evening fine we can go ahead with our discussion
20/11/23, 11:04 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I'm sorry for that, I will be available for our session tomorrow.
20/11/23, 11:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great night ahead.
20/11/23, 11:06 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you very much, I wish you the same
20/11/23, 11:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
21/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since our available hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm, I hope you will be available considering there is a deadline as well with the offer letter, I hope you will prioritize this discussion. I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
22/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Wessly.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/11/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good evening Admission officer, I hope you're doing well.
22/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Now I was able to go through the message you shared earlier, and I can see how Wessly is impacted by his uncle here, since he is mostly working out of Zimbabwe and hence this makes him more inclined towards the course right?
22/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 71 761 2163: We can connect now but the network is poor
22/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, we have not been able to discuss the letter for a long time. I completely understand that network can be a challenge, however, I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
22/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes sir.
22/11/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please changing course is not an issue. Due to the specialized nature of Aerospace Engineering, career opportunities are somewhat limited to specific industries, only a select number of universities, such as Lovely Professional University (One of the top 5 universities in India), choose to provide this course. 

In universities like LPU, where Aerospace Engineering is offered, the availability of scholarship seats is restricted. Typically, these universities only offer a scholarship of around 30%. However, we at Edoofa have diligently worked to secure a higher scholarship of 50% for the eligible students.
22/11/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this consideration, the approximate annual cost of education for Aerospace Engineering would be around $3700 compared to $3000 for Mechanical Engineering at Galgotias (I will help you understand the breakup better as we move forward with our discussion).
22/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Actually, I agree to everything you are saying
22/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 761 2163: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you are having network challenge, in that case, would prefer to connect with us during the afternoon 12:30 pm?
22/11/23, 10:42 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yeah we can connect during that time because around 18:00 network will be a big challenge especially when there will be no electricity.
23/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Noted and I understood, thank you very much.
23/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon Mr Kirti, I hope you're having a great day we can connect.
23/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Wessly.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
23/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes, I am available.
23/11/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, let us now focus on discussing the offer letter now, and any queries that you might have can be covered after the discussion of the offer letter, may I know if this is alright?
23/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes, please
23/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear with the payment plans?
23/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I'm clear with the payment plans.
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
23/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 761 2163: No, I don't reside in Harare.
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
23/11/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you very much, that way it may be easier. I don't stay very far away from Harare, it is easier for me to go to Harare and make the payments.
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Noted.
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
23/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes, please.
23/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

*Mr. Charles Jerera*

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
23/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you very much.
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
23/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Noted.
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I have understood. Thank you once again.
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $3000. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
23/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes

24/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon Admission officer, I hope I find you well.
24/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
24/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 761 2163: That part of pay now didn't review
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for keeping me informed, and I understand the challenge you're facing, I believe this must be because of the network. To facilitate the payment process for you, we can utilize PayPal as an alternative. Please note that PayPal charges a transfer fee of 10% of the amount you wish to send. This method is convenient if you have a Visa/MasterCard.

To assist you further, could you kindly confirm whether you are familiar with PayPal as a mode of payment? Once confirmed, we will proceed to request the invoice from the accounts team.

Looking forward to your response.
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I'm not familiar with PayPal mode
24/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please in that case, what you can do is either you can do is download PayPal and make an account for the same, so that we can share the invoice with you or you can do is make the payment through the modes that I shared above.
24/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well it's fine
24/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 761 2163: But Mr Rajan will not be available tomorrow
24/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, since the deadline stands on the 28th of November you can pay when he is available by Monday.
24/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I will be at work
24/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you also have Mr. Charels?
24/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Well on different issue now l guess Galgotias offers electrical engineering is it fine if he can switch to that
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is certainly possible since he has the subjects he will be able to change his field of engineering, to Galgotias University, however, for now, it will not be possible since Wessly has already received the offer letter and if we ask the university to change the course now, they would get a negative impression that the student is not serious enough for the scholarship, so it is certainly possible after you register yourself with the university.
24/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to the payment modes, if such a thing is to happen, Mr. Rajan keep us informed, however, we do not have any updates like this from him, also if that is the case, we can even provide you with his Mukuru details. May I know if you are aware about Mukuru?
