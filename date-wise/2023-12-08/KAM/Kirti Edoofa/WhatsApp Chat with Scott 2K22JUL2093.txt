23/10/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 3:41 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Alright <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 3:45 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Alright
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: The first step is where the founders of edofa contact us and tell us the importance of edofa 
The second step is them giving us a short explanation on the purpose of edofa 
The third step is the counseling that we go through to prepare us 
Stage four is where we offer letters to different varieties of colleges and universities 
The fifth step is where the schools that I have applied for accept my letter and admit me in their school 

The last and final step is my preparing my visa
23/10/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
23/10/23, 3:51 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: No I do not
23/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes it is
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
23/10/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/10/23, 4:01 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes
23/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
23/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
23/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes we are
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
23/10/23, 4:11 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes I have
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/10/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, you did not share the remaining documents. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Scott,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?

26/10/23, 3:01 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Greetings

26/10/23, 3:29 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Anytime once the school Principal sends it to us. We are waiting to hear from him that why we are delaying.
26/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, alright. I shall wait for your response.
26/10/23, 3:42 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Thank you for your understanding
26/10/23, 6:54 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the letter, it is duly noted with us. Now we shall prepare for your application to share with the universities. The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. We shall share the applications with the universities once you have shared all the documents with us. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/10/23, 8:35 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Thank you Mr. Kirti  

However what other document are remaining for university scholarship application purposes? 

Does the passport and 🆔 also are needed as of now?  Scott is half Malawian and half Zambian. We are going to use Zambian passport and id 🆔 for his travel purposes.
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that in that case, you can share that passport picture.
27/10/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Scott.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the picture, however, I was referring to Scott's identity proof picture, and you can share any one of the mentioned identity proofs.

Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)
27/10/23, 1:26 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Good afternoon,

Please I mentioned that these are not readily available as of yet. 
However, can these be used for the application while we are working for the international travel passport.
27/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, in that case, you can share your identity proof for the time being please.
27/10/23, 1:43 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Alright

15/11/23, 7:58 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Greetings 
Yes we are.
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes we are
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Alright
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: 1. It is $1800
2. It is 5 years 
3. It’s $300
4. $750
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265993480095 could you please let me know the per semester fee after scholarship for question 1?
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: It’s $900
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes it does
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 8:48 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: I understand
15/11/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 8:52 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes it does
15/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 8:54 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes I am
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes we are
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Scott,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
16/11/23, 12:59 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes we are
16/11/23, 1:00 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: I don’t understand
16/11/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes it is
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: No I do not stay in Zimbabwe
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
16/11/23, 3:51 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Explain where you stay properly Scott please
16/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Telegraphic Transfer please.
16/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, you can let us know one day prior when you make the payment, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 4:05 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: I understand
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 4:06 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Galgotians University is in New Delhi? 
Pardon me for taking you off the topic, however the cost of Independent Accommodation looks way cheaper.
16/11/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265882737531 Yes please and do not worry we will be sharing the university insights as well. Indeed, all our students prefer off- campus accommodation.
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes I have
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 4:21 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Alright. 
Am following
16/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 6:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 6:27 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: I do not have any queries
16/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
16/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
16/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
16/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
16/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
16/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities. 

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).

16/11/23, 6:57 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Quite nice surroundings and institutions. Very impressive
16/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
16/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
16/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
16/11/23, 7:10 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes it does
16/11/23, 7:11 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Thank you for your time today and for the information. 

Rest well.
16/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome have a great evening ahead
16/11/23, 7:13 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Thank you counselor Kirt.
16/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
18/11/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
18/11/23, 2:59 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Thank you and duly noted. I wish you a quick recovery
18/11/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
20/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Scott!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes we did
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: We discussed the matter and thought it wise to pay the registration fee but wait for more offers and we compare the offers from different schools
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
20/11/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/11/23, 2:35 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes thank you for the clarification
20/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, let me help you understand even better.

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yea which is the registration fee. Which helps us secure our position in the school
20/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please this is the registration fee and the payment plan that we discussed earlier.
20/11/23, 3:15 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: I understand
20/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So would you like me to explain transfer option to you?
20/11/23, 3:43 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes thank you
20/11/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/11/23, 3:47 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes it does thank you very much
20/11/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: I personally do not have any questions. I am not quite sure about @265882737531
20/11/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/11/23, 3:51 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: Yes I was.
20/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
20/11/23, 4:29 pm - +265 993 48 00 95: My mother will answer this question
20/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I shall wait for her response.
20/11/23, 6:11 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: I will pay at once the $600, please. 
Thank you
20/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: That will be through wire transfer. I will confirm the date tomorrow.
20/11/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, can I expect you will be able to update me about the date tomorrow by 12:30 pm?
20/11/23, 7:06 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Hopefully.
20/11/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please have a great evening ahead let us reconnect tomorrow.
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Yes, blessed night. Rest well.
21/11/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Scott,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 2:16 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Good day counselor. 
Yes we can continue.
21/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know by when will you be able to share an update with me about the same?
21/11/23, 3:13 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: We may not be able to give a precise date of payment but definitely it will be before the 28th November.
21/11/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265882737531 thank you for letting me know that, now this is something I can understand however, we need to update the date to the university as well so that they hold on to that seat for the student, so I kindly request you think thoroughly today and you can update me tomorrow about the same, may I know if that is alright?
21/11/23, 3:20 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: It’s alright sir, we already discussed this thoroughly and we like the Galgotia University.  

We would say please go ahead and ask them to reserve the place for us. 

Malawi has a forex proplem, therefore we are outsourcing from outside people to pay for us while we give them Malawi Kwacha. That’s why it’s a bit difficult to be precise.
21/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand that it can be a challenge, however, you can deposit the money from the bank, and then it is the bank that takes the time to process the payment, so I would like to have a clarity of date of payment form your side first?
21/11/23, 4:24 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: Yes we would otherwise pay through the bank. But banks here do not have forex. It’s unlikely that we may get it. Hence my looking around elsewhere in exchange. 

I hope you understand me.
21/11/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand, however, my question still remains the same maam, I would first like to know when you intend to make the initial deposit because the deadlines are stated by the university so even if the bank processes the payment within 3-4 working days at least we will be reserving Scott's seat.
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - +265 882 73 75 31: We are not paying through the Malawian banks sir. Probably let’s say in 3-4 days time.
21/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, can I anticipate that you are willing to make the first deposit on the 25th of November?
22/11/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Scott.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
22/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, could you please confirm the amount once again for the invoice?
23/11/23, 7:55 am - +265 882 73 75 31: Greetings counselor Kirti.

Pardon our silence, it is because I needed that clear response from the bank. You see this problem has made things difficult that we people looking for forex have to have someone to know to push things for you…
I didn’t want to keep apologizing but be at least certain of the date. Please be rest assured we are trying our best. 
In fact if we could know in advance what else may be needed for payment so we start applying now… it is a terrible economic situation we are in. 
We sincere apologise counselor Kirti.
29/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Scott.

I hope you are doing well. I completely understand what you are trying to say here and you do not need to apologize please, in order to assist you in the best possible way, I am willing to have a discussion with the academic board, however, for that please let me know by when will you be able to update regarding the date of payments?
