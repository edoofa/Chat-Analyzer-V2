This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
19/09/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *Mwenje  EWYL23E0694*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
19/09/23, 9:02 pm - +260 97 7798912: This is clear indeed
19/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into Mwenje's academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in her achievements and be dedicated to ensuring her access to the finest opportunities to launch her career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
19/09/23, 9:06 pm - +260 97 7798912: We had good sessions with the Counselor and looked at the benefits of Edoofa when compared with non Edoofa students.
19/09/23, 9:08 pm - +260 97 7798912: This was based on a comparative analysis of the actual regular fees of $6,000 to $8,000 per annum compared to $2000 or $3000 for the Edoofa Program
19/09/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 I am glad to know that you had such a great experience and indeed it is true that our aim is to provide affordable education and make the students employable ready at the same time. Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?

21/09/23, 11:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Mwenje.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the counseling feedback form and the EWYL pledge form. I was going through your EWYL pledge form and I noticed that you have mentioned that the orientation is 3/10/2023, however, please understand that the orientation date is the date followed by the EWYL availability date and the initiation date and orientation date should not differ by more than 3 days, so may I know by when will you be able to update the form and share the from again?
21/09/23, 11:52 am - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
Our thoughts were that if the orientation date is 3 October then after 3 days we would go to 7th.
21/09/23, 11:52 am - +260 97 7798912: What's your reaction?
21/09/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 Thank you for sharing your thoughts, however, as I clearly stated above, the EWYL availability date is followed by the Orientation date, y for example, if Mwenje is available to commence the EWYL program from 7th october, the orientation date is the next day followed, that is 8th October 2023. May I know if you are clear now?
21/09/23, 12:03 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I am clear about it
21/09/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know Mr. Dennis, so may I know by when will you be able to update the form and share again?
21/09/23, 12:05 pm - +260 97 7798912: I will share with you later in the afternoon
21/09/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, may I know a time by when can I expect you to share the updated form?
21/09/23, 12:13 pm - +260 97 7798912: By 17:00hrs CAT
21/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 please note that our available working hours are from *12.00 PM CAT to 04:00 PM CAT and 07.30 PM CAT to 10.30 PM CAT, Monday to Friday* hence connecting with you at 05.00 pm CAT will not be possible for me.
21/09/23, 12:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: I will see what happens
21/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 I would appreciate it if you share the update from before 04.00pm CAT today, as already stated above, that the admission process is likely to finish within 4 days if we move proactively.
21/09/23, 12:48 pm - +260 97 7798912: <Media omitted>

21/09/23, 12:56 pm - +260 97 7798912: The details number 2 we have indicated not applicable because on number 1 we have answered YES. Answer 2 requires an explanation if  one is not in a position to begin the EWYL Program. I hope this answers your concern
21/09/23, 12:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 Yes Mr. Dennis, however, However, as per our earlier discussions, I would like to remind you that your EWYL program was scheduled to commence on September 26th (Tuesday). Therefore, it is important that we reflect this corrected date in the form. Could you kindly assist me with the same clarification?
21/09/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 7798912: What was the basis for 26 September if I may ask?
21/09/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 7798912: I will be out of the country from 24 September to 5 October
21/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The next batch of students is supposed to commence their EWYL Program on the 26th of September. As per our earlier discussions, we have been reiterating the same instructions with you so that you can keep a note of the timeline shared, ensure to complete the procedures on time, and plan your availability accordingly.
21/09/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7798912: Ok then I will rehearse with my spouse and see the best way for this next phase
21/09/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7798912: We shall get back to you before 4pm CAT
21/09/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall wait for your response, I hope you will be able to have a discussion and update the form accordingly.
21/09/23, 3:56 pm - +260 97 7798912: <Media omitted>

21/09/23, 4:21 pm - +260 97 7798912: No problem
We can continue chatting
21/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
21/09/23, 4:27 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes we can go ahead
21/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 4:35 pm - +260 97 7798912: I have gone through the image
21/09/23, 4:35 pm - +260 97 7798912: You can proceed with the explanation
21/09/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/09/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
21/09/23, 4:46 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes please.
We can proceed
21/09/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm to continue with our discussion as our available working hours are over for now, I hope you will be available.
21/09/23, 4:57 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes
21/09/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/09/23, 8:28 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
I am here
21/09/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, may I know if you have any queries so far?
21/09/23, 8:31 pm - +260 97 7798912: I don't have anything to ask at the moment
21/09/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/09/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
21/09/23, 8:35 pm - +260 97 7798912: Well noted
21/09/23, 8:35 pm - +260 97 7798912: I am following attentively
21/09/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
21/09/23, 8:39 pm - +260 97 7798912: Does this amount vary from one university to the other? This question is based the statement that registration fees range between $500-750
21/09/23, 8:40 pm - +260 97 7798912: How long does it take to process the student visa
21/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand, yes the registration amount can vary as per different universities however, to be on the safer side we always encourage parents to prepare themselves mentally and financially for $750 so that if it can be used further in future, if extra. Now coming to your second query please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
21/09/23, 8:45 pm - +260 97 7798912: Let's keep going
21/09/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
21/09/23, 8:50 pm - +260 97 7798912: The message from the Founder's office sets the tone for the scope of work of Edoofa and the guidelines of what is involved in access to higher education.
21/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes indeed true. Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
21/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
21/09/23, 8:55 pm - +260 97 7798912: Kindly go ahead and share
21/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
21/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

21/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

21/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
21/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
21/09/23, 8:59 pm - +260 97 7798912: Can you allow me to watch them after our session
21/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you can please take your time to go through the videos and let us reconnect tomorrow at 02.30 pm. I hope you will be able to go through the videos by that time.
21/09/23, 9:05 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I will

26/09/23, 12:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. Dennis, Ms. Penny, and Michelin.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond and I noticed that you were able to go through the message, so may I know if you are facing any challenges that you would like to share?
26/09/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 7693061: Good morning
26/09/23, 12:29 pm - +260 97 7693061: We are well thanks
26/09/23, 12:29 pm - +260 97 7693061: Yesterday was a busy day but today we can chat
26/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand that you must be occupied and busy with work, however, I would have really appreciated it if you could inform me beforehand.
26/09/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7693061: It wasn't expected to be the way it turned out to be
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
26/09/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 7693061: Yes
26/09/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 7693061: We went through the videos
26/09/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - +260 97 7693061: It's generally about following counselling sessions and procedures of Edoofa.
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - +260 97 7693061: Which makes things easy for the students
26/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
26/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
26/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
26/09/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
26/09/23, 3:36 pm - +260 97 7693061: Thank you and well understood
26/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/09/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 7693061: We are on same page Sir
26/09/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Mwenje's application ahead and help to write a proper statement of purpose so that she can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on her application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require Mwenje's availability for approximately 30 minutes. If she is unavailable, she can provide you with her input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on her behalf.
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mwenje.

I hope you are in good health. Kindly excuse me for not contacting you earlier, as we had a long weekend followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 1:24 pm - +260 97 7798912: Hello 
We are available
03/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, thank you for sharing the academic documents, may I know by when will you be able to share the Identity proof as well?

03/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand, however, Friday is a long time, and we have already delayed the process, so may I know if you will be able to look for the birth certificate by tomorrow 12:30 pm?
03/10/23, 3:23 pm - +260 97 7798912: We can't lie that tomorrow it will be found. We need to do a thorough check
03/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I completely understand the need for a thorough check, especially when it comes to important documents or information. It's essential to ensure everything is in order and accurate in that case, let us reconnect on Friday at 12:30 p.m.
05/10/23, 11:35 am - +260 97 7798912: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 11:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mwenje.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 11:53 am - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
Yes we are
05/10/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate Mwenje's response and will be proceeding to work on them so that Mwenje's university application is well prepared.
05/10/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/10/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Mwenje wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry for her higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/10/23, 11:57 am - +260 97 7798912: Yes you are right
05/10/23, 12:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
05/10/23, 12:14 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes we are ready to proceed
05/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Mr. Dennis. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
05/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
05/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
05/10/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/10/23, 12:21 pm - +260 97 7798912: I have understood the information contained in this process including the receipt of multiple admission letters
05/10/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
05/10/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
05/10/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
05/10/23, 12:29 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes the counselor mentioned the fee.
I would however want to know how long this process takes of paying the registration fees if for example we count from now when we are in this counseling session
05/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please Mr. Dennis as we move forward your queries shall be covered. Do not worry about that.
05/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 12:44 pm - +260 97 7798912: Sure I am following
05/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/10/23, 12:51 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I am clear with this explanation
05/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
05/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
05/10/23, 12:54 pm - +260 97 7798912: Is it possible to make three instalments or four instead of monthly instalments. If such happens, how much would be the initial payment
05/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query Mr. Dennis, let me help you understand. Although our standard payment plan permits only two installments or monthly payments, we recognize that certain students may have unique financial requirements. If you would rather make three or four installments as opposed to monthly payments, this can be accommodated. However, it's important to note that the remaining balance must be settled before your arrival.  

I hope we are clear now?
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes that much I know and willing to follow it
05/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now as you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
05/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
05/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
05/10/23, 1:41 pm - +260 97 7798912: Great
This is insightful
05/10/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 1:46 pm - +260 97 7798912: Can the student be allowed to remain in university during semester break and only come at the end of each academic year for her break? Can the EWYL concept work out while on vacation?
05/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 Yes please, it completely depends upon the student if they want to stay here and explore and work on projects to get better skills during the semester break, however, if they wish to go back for the break they can do that too and yes the EWYL still continues while they are on vacation, depending how much the student is consistent. 

I hope we are clear now?
05/10/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7798912: It's clear
05/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
05/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:29 pm - +260 97 7798912: This looks exciting
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, it was great to meet them finally I am sure you are excited to see Mwenje in this picture for next year?
05/10/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 7798912: Definitely that's our wish as parents
05/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that, I am looking forward to meeting Mwenje as well. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 7798912: I have read and we can continue
05/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level/ Grade 12 results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means @260977798912 , as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 7798912: Okay noted
05/10/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 7798912: Carry on
05/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you? <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 3:41 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes it resonates well with me
05/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 3:49 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes it's well noted
05/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 4:11 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I am following
05/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 7798912: Kindly furnish me with the information
05/10/23, 4:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/grade 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades/ 45% passing marks. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
05/10/23, 4:45 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I have understood the concept
05/10/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades/ 45% passing marks to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades)/ 45% passing marks in grade 12 in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 4:58 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I know the grading system
05/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ Grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 5:00 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes
In Zambia they are to reseat for the weak subjects
05/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level/ Grade 12

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level/Grade 12 exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 5:09 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes this is very clear
05/10/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/10/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mwenje.

I hope this message finds you well, I am glad to hear that you have understood everything clearly since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/10/23, 1:44 pm - +260 97 7798912: Hi
We are fine. How is India so far?
06/10/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are doing fine and it is a bright sunny day here in India. May I know if you are available to connect with us ?
06/10/23, 2:06 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes please
06/10/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
06/10/23, 2:13 pm - +260 97 7798912: So far we are moving at the same pace
06/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/10/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 7798912: Ok well noted
06/10/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/10/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7798912: Currently what has been shared is well received
06/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Mwenje's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Mwenje is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
06/10/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 7798912: Everything is ok
06/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/10/23, 5:31 pm - +260 97 7798912: Enjoy your weekend
06/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you so much have a great weekend to you too.
26/10/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Mr. Dennis and Ms. Penny.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great may I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
26/10/23, 3:41 pm - +260 97 7798912: We don't have anything to share at the moment. What about you? Do you have anything for us as an update?
26/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We are still waiting for updates from the universities and this is something I can not answer as the delay is from the universities as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
08/11/23, 6:30 am - +260 97 7798912: Good Morning
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mwenje.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns?
27/11/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Mwenje,

30/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the above questions.

30/11/23, 4:05 pm - +260 97 7798912: December is a tricky period for us

Moving forward I would like to inform you that as we start with our discussion I'll help you understand the letter if at the end there is any query that is unattended then we can cater to that as well. So may I know if you are available to start with the discussion?
30/11/23, 4:20 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes I am available hence giving you my feedback
30/11/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please now let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1184, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2443. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
30/11/23, 4:26 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes please it does
30/11/23, 4:26 pm - +260 97 7798912: How will the feeding be
30/11/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
30/11/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
30/11/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
30/11/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2184 ($1184 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
30/11/23, 4:28 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes it does
30/11/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 7798912: Does the $1250 cover food if they are on campus?
30/11/23, 4:29 pm - +260 97 7798912: As for registration fees, how much is the initial payment anticipated?
30/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 yes the $1250 is the per annum cost and it includes food as well along with the basic expenses like wifi, water, and electricity bills.
30/11/23, 4:30 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
Wonderful explanation
30/11/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Dennis as I mentioned above, I would please encourage you to be patient since we will be discussing everything in detail. You do not have to be worried.
30/11/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
I notice Mwenje isn't added here
30/11/23, 4:32 pm - +260 97 7798912: Well noted
30/11/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have granted you the admin Mr. Dennis, please go ahead and add Mwenje to the group.
30/11/23, 4:33 pm - ~ Dennis Milanzi added +260 779747930
30/11/23, 4:34 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
I have done that
30/11/23, 4:34 pm - +260 779747930: Okay thank you dad
30/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Mwenje, how are you doing today?
30/11/23, 4:37 pm - +260 779747930: I'm doing great thank you
30/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, congratulations on receiving the offer letter ⭐, you can go through the old conversation from your father's phone, right now let us move ahead with the discussion.
30/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
30/11/23, 4:40 pm - +260 779747930: I'm listening
30/11/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2184, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
30/11/23, 4:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
30/11/23, 4:43 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
It is well noted
30/11/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Mwenje with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
30/11/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2184. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2184 - $1000 = $1184, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
30/11/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
30/11/23, 4:45 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes it does
30/11/23, 4:46 pm - +260 97 7798912: @260779747930 
I hope you understand the matrix of the EWYL Program
30/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
30/11/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1184 - $750 = $434, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
30/11/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1184 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2434. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2434 - $750 = $1684 This amount can be paid in two installments of $842 and $842, spaced 6 months apart.
30/11/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
30/11/23, 4:49 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 yes it's well understood
30/11/23, 4:49 pm - +260 779747930: Yes dad
30/11/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as December 11, 2023.
30/11/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
30/11/23, 4:53 pm - +260 97 7798912: Please do
30/11/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Mwenje's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
30/11/23, 4:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
30/11/23, 4:55 pm - +260 97 7798912: Yes we take note
30/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
30/11/23, 4:58 pm - +260 97 7798912: We have used this method before
30/11/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Let me reshare the account details with you once -
30/11/23, 5:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Account Name* - Penmal Connect Limited
*Account Number* - 0222030000591
*Name of Bank* - Indo Zambia Bank
*Branch Name* - Jacaranda
*Sort Code* - 090122
*Swift Code* - INZAZMLX

Team, these are the updated details for payment from Zambia, please ensure you use these details from here on.
30/11/23, 5:02 pm - +260 97 7798912: What narration do we put when depositing
30/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 kindly excuse me for the delay in responding it was my dinner break. When you would connect with them you can inform them that the payment is regarding the registration fee
30/11/23, 6:07 pm - +260 97 7798912: Thank you for the response
30/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
30/11/23, 6:11 pm - +260 97 7798912: I don't have anything to ask at the moment
30/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
30/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.
30/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To gain a comprehensive understanding of PDM University's credentials and official recognition by the government of India, you can visit their website by following this link: [PDM University - Recognition & Approval] (https://www.pdm.ac.in/recognition-approval/).

30/11/23, 6:14 pm - +260 97 7798912: It looks good and clean
30/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
30/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
30/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be tomorrow. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
30/11/23, 6:21 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
What's the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees (INR) to a US$?
30/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260977798912 as per today the exchange rate of the Indian Rupees (INR) to a US$ is 1 INR = 0.011994 USD Nov 30, 2023.
30/11/23, 6:42 pm - +260 97 7798912: Thank you so much
30/11/23, 6:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great evening ahead.
01/12/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mwenje!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by PDM University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from PDM University as a collective?
01/12/23, 2:03 pm - +260 779747930: Good afternoon
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from PDM University as a collective?
01/12/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 7798912: @917292063289 
How are you doing
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 97 7798912: We discussed the offer letter and percentage offer. One collective concern as parents is that we anticipated Mwenje to qualify for a 70% scholarship because of other educational constraints for Mwenje's siblings. If we are to pay 30% plus the Airticket and other needs for Mwenje while in university this would be more realistic to us.
Would you be in a position to support our request?
01/12/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I completely understand what you are saying here. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
01/12/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
01/12/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
01/12/23, 4:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the PDM university and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now? <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 8:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning to Parents and Mwenje,

I trust you are in good health. I've been eagerly anticipating your response to my previous message. However, I understand that you may not have had the opportunity to reply just yet. If convenient for you, could you kindly confirm whether our communication is still ongoing? Your confirmation would be appreciated.
02/12/23, 8:41 am - +260 779747930: Good morning
02/12/23, 9:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greeting Mwenje, may I know if you were able to go through my messages from yesterday?
02/12/23, 9:13 am - +260 779747930: Yes I did go through them
02/12/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 7693061: Well understood.  Then we wait  for the other universities
02/12/23, 10:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by PDM, you would lose out on the scholarship from PDM and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
02/12/23, 11:10 am - +260 97 7693061: We are not aware
02/12/23, 11:10 am - +260 97 7693061: If you can help us understand we will appreciate
02/12/23, 11:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with PDM by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at PDM without risking losing out on the scholarship.
02/12/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to PDM to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for PDM, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
02/12/23, 11:19 am - +260 97 7693061: I am clear thank you very much
02/12/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
02/12/23, 11:22 am - +260 97 7693061: No question, our only major concern about fees
02/12/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
02/12/23, 11:43 am - +260 97 7693061: We searched for the universities in order to appreciate the environment
02/12/23, 11:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is fantastic to hear. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 11, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
02/12/23, 12:15 pm - +260 97 7693061: Let me discuss this with family then we get back to you
02/12/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, can I anticipate you will be able to update me by Monday?
02/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 97 7693061: Yes
04/12/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and Mwenje. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.

We have been trying to do some analysis on the matter but also our desire to get responses from other universities. As indicated, the first offer of 55% wasn't going to be feasible.
Let's see how other offers will come.
Mwenje isn't the only in tertiary education and so we need to make sure we have a balanced equation to these decisions since she will have to be in a foreign land
05/12/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mwenje.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your concern with me, we completely understand that you alone will not be able to cater all the costs, but you know this offer letter is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and that too an opportunity to study internationally, students ideally not even get a 50% scholarship however, your daughter has been able to secure a 55% scholarship offer, although I understand that even after this scholarship these challenges can occur so could you please help me understand what is the particular challenge that you have or which cost according to you is the challenge? Maybe you can help me with this
