If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
30/11/23, 4:21 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes pliz let's do while I am waiting for my son to edit for me
30/11/23, 4:22 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes let's start
30/11/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 4:25 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Done
30/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
30/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
30/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
30/11/23, 4:28 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes they are clear
30/11/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
30/11/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/11/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
30/11/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
30/11/23, 4:34 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes I am following
30/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
30/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
30/11/23, 4:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
30/11/23, 4:37 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Very clear thank you
30/11/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/11/23, 4:39 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes let's start
30/11/23, 4:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/11/23, 4:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

5. A Statement Of Purpose (SOP) is a very important document which students should be prompt and diligent in filling out
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kelvin, Wishing you a good day!

I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos, have shared great insights with us. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
01/12/23, 12:33 pm - +27 81 002 7935: Yes, we have understood
01/12/23, 12:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
01/12/23, 12:34 pm - +27 81 002 7935: Indeed, we are
01/12/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant! Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 9:00 AM.
01/12/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

04/12/23, 5:48 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Question 2)

Primary memory, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is volatile and used for temporary storage of data that the computer is currently processing. It allows quick access to information but loses its content when the power is turned off. For example, when you open a document or run a program, the data is temporarily stored in RAM for fast retrieval.

On the other hand, secondary memory, like a hard drive or SSD (Solid State Drive), is non-volatile and used for long-term storage of data. It retains information even when the power is off. Secondary memory is crucial for storing the operating system, software, and user files. For instance, your documents, photos, and installed applications are typically stored on the hard drive or SSD.

In summary, primary memory provides fast but temporary storage, while secondary memory offers slower but persistent storage for essential data and applications.
04/12/23, 5:48 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Question 3)

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardises the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers help ensure that different networking technologies can work together seamlessly. 

1. **Physical Layer:** The lowest layer deals with the physical connection between devices, defining aspects like cables, connectors, and electrical signals.

2. **Data Link Layer:** This layer is responsible for reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication over a physical link, involving protocols for framing, addressing, and error detection.

3. **Network Layer:** It manages routing and addressing, ensuring data packets can be delivered across multiple networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at this layer.

4. **Transport Layer:** This layer provides end-to-end communication, ensuring data integrity and flow control. Examples include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

5. **Session Layer:** It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections or sessions between applications. It also manages dialogue control and synchronization.

6. **Presentation Layer:** Responsible for translating data between the application layer and the lower layers, dealing with data format conversions, encryption, and compression.

7. **Application Layer:** The topmost layer interacts directly with end-user applications, providing network services such as email, file transfers, and remote file access.
04/12/23, 5:48 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Question 4)

Operator overloading allows a programmer to define multiple behaviours for an operator based on the operand types. Here's how it works in different languages:

1. **C++:**
   In C++, operator overloading enables the definition of custom behaviours for operators. For example, you can define how the '+' operator works for user-defined classes by overloading the '+' operator. This feature provides flexibility and allows developers to create more intuitive and readable code.

2. **Java:**
   Java does not support traditional operator overloading like C++. In Java, operators have a fixed meaning for built-in types. However, for classes, you can achieve a similar effect by defining methods with meaningful names (e.g., `add`, `subtract`) instead of overloading operators directly.

3. **Python:**
   Python supports operator overloading extensively. Developers can define special methods (e.g., `__add__`, `__sub__`) within a class to specify the behaviour of operators for instances of that class. This allows for a more natural and expressive coding style, enhancing the readability of code.

In summary, while C++ and Python provide robust support for operator overloading, Java, although not supporting traditional operator overloading, allows achieving similar functionality through method naming conventions.

Technological advancements play a pivotal role in fostering economic growth by driving innovation, increasing efficiency, and creating new opportunities. Firstly, improved technology enhances productivity across various sectors. Automation, artificial intelligence, and advanced manufacturing processes lead to increased output with fewer resources, reducing costs and boosting economic output.

Additionally, technology facilitates the development of new industries and business models. The digital economy, driven by technologies like cloud computing, e-commerce, and mobile applications, opens avenues for entrepreneurship and job creation. It enables small businesses to reach global markets, fostering economic diversification.

Furthermore, advancements in communication technology enhance connectivity, enabling seamless global trade and collaboration. The Internet has transformed the way businesses operate, fostering international trade, and promoting economic integration.

In the education sector, technology provides access to knowledge and skills, empowering the workforce with the tools needed for a knowledge-based economy. This, in turn, attracts foreign investment and promotes a skilled workforce, crucial for sustained economic growth.

Environmental sustainability is also addressed through technology, as innovations in clean energy, resource management, and sustainable practices contribute to green economic growth.
04/12/23, 5:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response regarding academic interview question. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma (Computer Science Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/12/23, 5:54 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes it is accurate
04/12/23, 5:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/12/23, 5:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/12/23, 5:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/12/23, 6:07 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Yes it is not possible
04/12/23, 6:07 pm - +27 83 986 0810: Ok
04/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 6:17 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes we discussed about the registration fee with the counselor
04/12/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 6:21 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes that's great
04/12/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
04/12/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
04/12/23, 6:24 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes I understand
04/12/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @27717070139 Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
04/12/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900  each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
04/12/23, 6:33 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Noted 🙏
04/12/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/12/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
04/12/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/12/23, 6:49 pm - +27 71 707 0139: That's great
04/12/23, 6:50 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Noted
04/12/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 7:34 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I have no queries I understand everything and I am happy to have this opportunity to further my child 's education through this program
04/12/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps
04/12/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
04/12/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
04/12/23, 7:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 8:04 pm - +27 71 707 0139: We are eagerly waiting for the offer letter thank you for helping us 🙏
04/12/23, 8:04 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Awesome
04/12/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @27717070139 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
04/12/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
04/12/23, 8:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
04/12/23, 8:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27717070139 May I know if we are still connected?
04/12/23, 8:53 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I have reviewed them
04/12/23, 8:54 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Still connected
04/12/23, 8:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
04/12/23, 8:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Kelvin, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
04/12/23, 9:00 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Noted thank you
04/12/23, 9:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27717070139, Let's move forward with second benefit.
04/12/23, 9:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
04/12/23, 9:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
04/12/23, 9:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/12/23, 9:04 pm - +27 71 707 0139: Yes this explanation resonate with me
04/12/23, 9:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
04/12/23, 9:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/12/23, 9:11 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I understand and it's reasonable
04/12/23, 9:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
04/12/23, 9:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
04/12/23, 9:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
04/12/23, 9:20 pm - +27 71 707 0139: It's okay  .it sounds great
04/12/23, 9:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 9:22 pm - +27 71 707 0139: No queries thank you
04/12/23, 9:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
04/12/23, 9:25 pm - +27 71 707 0139: I am very excited and looking forward to receive the offer letter

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
