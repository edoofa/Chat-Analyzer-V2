11/10/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 227 1141: The third video talks about universities and colleges  under Edoofa scholarship which have a holistic culture where friendship and education.

11/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 227 1141: It states that the SOP is not just document but it should outline one's abilities, unique traits, strengths , abilities and skills.

11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Prosper, that is correct. These videos have provided you with a comprehensive understanding of the admission journey and how Edoofa supports students in their pursuit of higher education
11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to students' career goals.
11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/10/23, 9:19 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
11/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 227 1141: Yes I have understood this and the videos explained well on these
11/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 227 1141: I agree with all the above
11/10/23, 9:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 09:00 AM.
11/10/23, 9:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

11/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 227 1141: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 10:18 am - Ashi Edoofa: Understood @263772271141 that you were going through the shared documents. Regarding your concern, let me inform you that for the team to work on his application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, he will have to take his time and try to complete these.
11/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 227 1141: Understood
11/10/23, 10:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: The question from 2 - 5 should be answered in about 150-200 words.
11/10/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
11/10/23, 10:22 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when Prosper will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
11/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 227 1141: 2. The difference between rights and duties is that a duty is a requirement that someone does something while a right  is a requirement that someone receives something. Hence the difference is that duty specifies the donor but not the recipient, whereas a right specifies the recipient but not the donor.  Human rights are rights that everyone should have for example freedom of association while  civil rights are granted by government for example right to housing
11/10/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 227 1141: I am trying to contact him he isn't reachable at the moment. If possible can I answer on his behalf for progress' sake
11/10/23, 10:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand the concern @263772271141, but these documents needs to be attended by the prosper as these documents will be shared to the universities for his admission and hence these documents must be filled by Prosper. While I understand the challenges that Prosper is not reachable at the moment, With that in mind, I would like to encourage you that you can fill these forms by today and we'll connect tomorrow at 9:00 am. By this time, I am sure that Prosper will get a chance to complete the above process. What are your thoughts on this?
11/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 227 1141: 3. A prosecutor works for the government agency bringinging criminal charges and must prove the defendant' s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while the attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence
11/10/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 227 1141: Ok if it's for Prosper Only tomorrow will be fine hope then he would have managed to get the chance to answer .  On my side I was almost done answering all the questions.
11/10/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 227 1141: He is currently doing his final touches on revisions next week Tuesday he starts his final exams so teachers will be with him almost every time during the day
11/10/23, 10:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: I want to express my gratitude for your efforts, @263772271141 . However, as I've previously mentioned that, this particular tasks must be carried out by Prosper. Although, I completely understand that his examination date is fast approaching, and his schedule is undoubtedly tight with preparations.

Nevertheless, it's important to note that the completion of the Statement of Purpose and the related documents should not be overly time-consuming; in fact, they should only require about 30 minutes. I surely believe that, he can get sometime to complete the same as this process will potentially unlock new opportunities for him, making the effort well worth it in the long run.
11/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 227 1141: Ok noted I will keep on trying to reach him so that he completes all the requirements today
11/10/23, 11:00 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 09:00 am for our next session. 

I hope by then prosper will be able to complete all the documents. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a amazing day ahead.

Moreover, I hope you have taken a note of my last message that we'll continue our session tomorrow at 9:00 am. Please note the timing so that you'll not missed our scheduled session.
11/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 227 1141: PROSPER have managed to fill the statement of purpose and has rushed back to ongoing lessons
11/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Noted
11/10/23, 12:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I truly appreciate his dedication and efforts in successfully crafting the Statement of Purpose.
12/10/23, 5:06 am - +263 78 090 4054: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 5:07 am - +263 78 090 4054: 2. The difference between rights and duties is that a duty is a requirement that someone does something while a right  is a requirement that someone receives something and duty specifies the donor but not the recipient, whereas a right specifies the recipient but not the donor.  Human rights are rights that everyone should have for example freedom of association while  civil rights are granted by government for example right to housing.                                                 3.

12/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Ok its clear
12/10/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
12/10/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 227 1141: very clear
12/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 227 1141: clear
12/10/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
12/10/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 227 1141: ok
12/10/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 227 1141: No queries for now
12/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have clearly understood the process. As Prosper's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Prosper is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
12/10/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 227 1141: very much excited
12/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
12/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
12/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Thank you so much looking forward to your unwavering support always
12/10/23, 1:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772271141
12/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 227 1141: On this note we send this message to ourEWYL Mentor Ms Saloni and she requested us that if we are available from today onwards we can commence and said yes to this. So we commenced the procedures today with a time slot of 13:30-14:30 everyday
13/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Thank you
13/10/23, 12:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263772271141
13/10/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Saloni and she has scheduled my session for 1330hrs to 1430hrs and we have started today
13/10/23, 12:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263780904054 Wish you all the best for this new beginning, Make it count
13/10/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Ok thank you
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prosper.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by MVN University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 01.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement!
15/10/23, 11:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 5:54 am - +263 78 090 4054: Thank you sir to you and the rest of tge admission team
16/10/23, 5:55 am - +263 78 090 4054: Thank you sir. We couldn't have done it without your aid
16/10/23, 7:41 am - +27 73 928 3175: 💃💃💃💃💃💃💃
16/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 227 1141: Thank you very much for this opportunity and for all your unwavering support
16/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we will discuss that further as well. Now, I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
16/10/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
16/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 227 1141: 1. $350           
2. $0
3. $1600  
4. $250
5. $1000
16/10/23, 3:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/10/23, 3:03 pm - +27 73 928 3175: Yes
16/10/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
16/10/23, 3:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
16/10/23, 3:06 pm - +27 73 928 3175: Yes
16/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Crystal clear
16/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Clear
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
16/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Understood
16/10/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Very clear. Is there a situation where one fails to reach 800 credits per year
17/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Greetings of the day to all.
17/10/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear, when it comes to earning credits with the help of the EWYL Program, there is no limit to how much credits that a student can earn, and along with that, there is no specific situation where in you can fail to earn this much scholarship credits, since your mentor will bet here for you all along to make sure that you are doing well in the EWYL Program. I hope this is clear?
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Clear
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Clear
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
17/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Understood
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850  - $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Clear
17/10/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
17/10/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 29th November 2023.*
17/10/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 227 1141: Yes we are
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 227 1141: The deadline is too close not sure if we can be able to arrange for this in this short space of time since we are to arrange for the $150 balance for Edoofa enrolment fee but we will try
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask when is the deadline for you to pay the remaining Enrollment Fee please?
17/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 227 1141: 9th of November
17/10/23, 5:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, how would you be then planning to move ahead with the registration process please?
17/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 227 1141: We are still running around and we will advise in the due course. Meanwhile we can proceed with whatever that needs to be done
18/10/23, 5:37 am - +263 77 227 1141: We have agreed to first pay the Admission fee since it's the one that has a due date that is fast approaching while we look for that balance which is due on the 9th of November
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/10/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?

18/10/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment.

This is Ms. Vilsha, the head of admission at Edoofa. 

Please excuse Mr. Milan for not being able to help you with the updates, he was a bit under the weather and hence is currently unavailable. 

However, I was able to review the messages you shared, and if I am correct, I believe that you have been waiting for a Mama Money Order for the remaining amount of $425 for your university registration fee? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 090 4054: Yes ma'am
18/11/23, 4:38 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation. To help you with the same order, could you please let me know when you intend to make the payment? As Mama Money orders are only valid for 24 hours, understanding your preferred timeline will enable us to coordinate the order appropriately, ensuring its validity.
18/11/23, 4:41 pm - +27 73 928 3175: Tomorrow sir
18/11/23, 4:42 pm - +27 73 928 3175: Create order for 325

18/11/23, 4:45 pm - +27 73 928 3175: Yes the pending fee is 425  so tomorrow I'm ready to pay 325 then balance on Friday
18/11/23, 4:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, and that will work perfectly. Regarding the order, as you must be aware that there is a monthly account transaction limit for Mama Money. I just checked with the accounts team and they mentioned that the Mama Money's Limit for this month has been reached due to a higher number of students joining the program from South Africa.
18/11/23, 4:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Since you are planning to make the payments in parts, here is what you can do: visit the Mama Money agent you went to last time and provide them with the following details for the payment:

- *Beneficiary Name:* Avreen Singh
- *Bank Name:* ICICI Bank
- *Savings Account Number:* 055201503452
