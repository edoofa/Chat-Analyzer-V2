05/08/23, 12:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kafula!
I hope you are doing well today.

I have an exciting news to share with you. When you paid the the first part of your registration fee, we shared your application with a few of our partner universities. And I would like to share that LPU has also accepted your application and shared your Offer Letter. Congratulations to you on that! ⭐🎓

I am sending the offer letter here, please go through it once and then let me know when you are done, we will connect with each other tomorrow at 10.30 PM to discuss the same and plan the way ahead for your admission process.
05/08/23, 12:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/08/23, 12:23 pm - +260 96 6605412: Thank you so much we've received and we will go through it
Good morning to you too
06/08/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kafula!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
06/08/23, 10:43 am - +260 96 6605412: Good morning sir
We are doing great thank you and you
06/08/23, 10:44 am - +260 96 6605412: We are available sir
06/08/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
06/08/23, 10:55 am - +260 96 9125560: 1.$975
2.3years
3.$200
4.$700
06/08/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
06/08/23, 11:00 am - +260 96 6605412: Yes it is sir <This message was edited>
06/08/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
06/08/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
06/08/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
06/08/23, 11:03 am - +260 96 6605412: Understood sir
06/08/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675. 

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
06/08/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
06/08/23, 11:11 am - +260 96 6605412: Yes sir we are clear
06/08/23, 11:23 am - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
06/08/23, 11:27 am - +260 96 6605412: Yes we are sir
06/08/23, 11:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, Moving forward to the registration fee -

The registration fee which we discussed earlier is $700 for LPU, and your admission processing fee is $200, which is one-time payable. To reserve a scholarship seat with the university one has to pay $700 in total and if you see your offer letter. Now, since you have already paid a part of the admission fee earlier for MVN University, and if after our discussion here, you wished to transfer your admission to LPU, then the paid fee will be adjusted for your admission at LPU and then you will have to pay the balance for LPU registration fee i.e. $700. I hope this is clear?
06/08/23, 11:40 am - +260 96 6605412: It is clear and we don't intend to make a transfer from mvn to any university for now <This message was edited>
06/08/23, 11:48 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that. For now, let us move ahead to first complete the discussion here and then you can take your time to make your final decision. I hope you understand?
06/08/23, 11:50 am - +260 96 6605412: Yes sir
06/08/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Before we wrap up our discussion on your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to raise?
06/08/23, 11:52 am - +260 96 6605412: Just two concerns sir
06/08/23, 11:53 am - +260 96 6605412: The date of birth and the nationality are incorrect sir
06/08/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, it will be corrected moving ahead, any other concerns or queries apart from that?
06/08/23, 11:58 am - +260 96 6605412: There are no other concerns or queries sir
06/08/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
06/08/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students. 

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

06/08/23, 12:14 pm - +260 96 6605412: Thank you for the insights sir
It is a very beautiful university
06/08/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
06/08/23, 1:27 pm - +260 96 9125560: Alright sir understood
06/08/23, 7:28 pm - +260 96 9125560: Hello Mr millan, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is ms Saloni Rastogi
07/08/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kafula!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/08/23, 10:52 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, may I know if you were able to have a discussion about the offer letter from LPU as a family by now?
07/08/23, 11:16 am - +260 96 6605412: We are doing well sir 
We hope you are doing well 
And yes we where able to discuss
07/08/23, 11:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Great. So how did the discussion with your family go about the offer letter from LPU, what were their thoughts?
07/08/23, 11:37 am - +260 96 6605412: They said it's a very lovely university and we are looking into it
And by Gods grace we might take kafula there
07/08/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, since you have an offer letter from two different universities, i.e. MVN and LPU, may I know which university are you parents more inclined towards and where do they wish to send you for your higher education?
07/08/23, 12:25 pm - +260 96 6605412: Forgive me for the late reply
And we are most inclined to MVN for now because of the current financial status
07/08/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, may I know if we shall move ahead to finalize your admission for MVN University please?
07/08/23, 1:14 pm - +260 96 6605412: Yes sir
07/08/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Let us confirm that with the university and move ahead to the next steps. 

Also, can you please let me know by when are you planning to pay the remaining admission fee as well?
07/08/23, 2:02 pm - +260 96 6605412: By 20 of August

08/08/23, 9:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, when it comes to making the payment of the balance fee, I understand that you are planning to make that by 20th August, however, as you can see that we are already in the month of August and we also need to complete other steps for Kafula such as VISA Process and Travel Preparations, so, I would advise you to make the payment a bit earlier so that we can confirm the admission as soon as possible and then transit to the next steps in her admission journey.
08/08/23, 9:02 am - +260 96 6605412: Ok sir I will look into it
