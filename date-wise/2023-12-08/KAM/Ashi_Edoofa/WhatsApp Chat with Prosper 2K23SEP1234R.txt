I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , we can start
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Okay you can explain the process
20/09/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/09/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright that's fine
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes l have understood
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 068 4943: It's okay
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , l am following the steps
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright I understand
20/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yeah , thank you for the explanation
20/09/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

22/09/23, 12:04 am - +263 78 068 4943: On the first video they discussed that students must follow instructions while continuing their application and do exactly what they are told to do .They talked about the EWYL program and urged  students to try  earning more scholarship credits which covers their fees  left for tuition .They gave an example of a student named Courage who earned a lot to cover the fee left for tuition through the EWYL program . I think that's all l got and it's really important as well.
22/09/23, 12:09 am - +263 78 068 4943: On the second video , they talked about Edoofa's Vision for us as students ,they said Edoofa's Vision is to help , giving students a chance to have quality education which is affordable.They also said a student should be employable and that can be done though the EWYL program and students can gain experience on the projects undertaken.
22/09/23, 12:13 am - +263 78 068 4943: On the third video , they talked about universities  , explaining that they choose particular universities which suits international students and which offer good education .They also talked about the EWL Program which make students employable not for a student to just have ideas which he/she cannot use .They gave an example of student who van study engineering and have engineering knowledge and ideas but can not express them on ground . That's what I've understood on that and it's helpful to me as well .

26/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes I am available we can start
26/09/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, I was going through your understanding and Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
26/09/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
26/09/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
26/09/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
26/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes l understand and I'm grateful for that
26/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Okay thank you for the explanation

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
26/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes we are on the same page
26/09/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
26/09/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.

They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.

28/09/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Commerce, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
28/09/23, 11:17 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Afternoon
28/09/23, 11:17 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes that's it
29/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Prosper.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was past our available working hours, so we were unable to get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/09/23, 10:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Prosper.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges?
30/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 068 4943: How are you , today I am available for the session
30/09/23, 11:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. That is great to know. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
30/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 068 4943: No challenges , it's just that the exams are about to start , so most of the times I will be studying
30/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 068 4943: Yes ma'am , l am ready
30/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
30/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
30/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
30/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright
30/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Understood
30/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , it's not .What will I do then.
30/09/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
30/09/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
30/09/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
30/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright
30/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes ,he explained about it
30/09/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
30/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes ma'am, thank you for this information
30/09/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
30/09/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes l have
30/09/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
30/09/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
30/09/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright
30/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Okay
30/09/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
30/09/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
30/09/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
30/09/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright , that will be really helpful to reduce the costs
30/09/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed Prosper. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 068 4943: No queries
30/09/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
30/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yeah sure
30/09/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
30/09/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 068 4943: I appreciate
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
30/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
30/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Thank you for that , it's really important
30/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 068 4943: We can proceed , l am done reviewing the benefits
30/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Prosper, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright
30/09/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 068 4943: I understand it
30/09/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/09/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/09/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/09/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright , how will you be assisting ?
30/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand that as well.

3. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Okay, so it will remain the same right ?
30/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , l understand
30/09/23, 1:29 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes ma'am , thank you for explaining on that
30/09/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes you are correct now for a better understanding.

4. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/09/23, 1:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/09/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright that's clear
30/09/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 068 4943: No
30/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 068 4943: You can explain it
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/09/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
30/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes ma'am , what about those students who will pass with higher grades
30/09/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Okay
30/09/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the last message?
30/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , l only need more explanation on it
30/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please if you pass with higher grades, the university will re-evaluate your application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. 

I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
30/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , thank you
30/09/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
30/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes ma'am
30/09/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
30/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes  , l agree
30/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
30/09/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
30/09/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , that's clear
30/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
30/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright that's clear as well
30/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright , l understand all of them
30/09/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 068 4943: I have no queries
30/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now as your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , really excited and grateful
30/09/23, 2:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright , I'll be waiting for it
30/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day and weekend ahead.
30/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Same to you
02/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Hello Ms Kirti !
What percentage of the scholarship can someone get after scoring A grade's in all subjects which is 15 points when doing 3 subjects.
03/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Prosper.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
03/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes, thank you so much for that
04/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Prosper!

06/10/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 068 4943: Yesterday l had more school work to do , but today will be okay if you can.

I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure dear, let us move ahead with our discussion here. Before we do that, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter from Galgotias University by now?
07/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes l have gone through it , but there are some things l need to know
07/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Afternoon
07/10/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we will make sure to discuss about all the things that you may need to know moving ahead during our conversation. For now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
07/10/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 068 4943: 1) $900
2) 3 years with 6 semesters
3) $300
4) $ 750
07/10/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
07/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , that's clear
07/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
07/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
07/10/23, 1:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
07/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 068 4943: So, on  that option of an AC room for the two-seater , this also  includes food costs for both of the two students right ?
07/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright
07/10/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is absolutely right.
07/10/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
07/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Okay
07/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , we are , you can proceed
09/10/23, 6:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 6:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you on Friday, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 6:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
10/10/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/10/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
11/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 068 4943: I am good and you
11/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 068 4943: Yes
11/10/23, 11:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion.

13/10/23, 1:23 am - +263 78 068 4943: How are you?
13/10/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.
13/10/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Regarding the payment plan, we will discuss the same now, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here about the same?
13/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Afternoon
13/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes we can discuss
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.

15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead with our discussion here, I believe you are clear till here, right?
16/10/23, 7:50 am - +263 78 068 4943: We wish you a quick recovery

16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 18th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 18th November 2023.*

16/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 068 4943: Morning
16/10/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 068 4943: Yes that's it

19/10/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Prosper!

I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Afternoon
26/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes l am available
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prosper!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear. Now, regarding that I would like to inform you that it may not be possible since you have already taken an extension fromm the side of the university to pay the fee by 30th October, now, on top of that if you would straight away pass on an update that you will pay on 1st November, I do not believe that this is the right way to do that dear. 

The university has its policies in place and they are very strict with them. In your case, I had already discussed the matter with them once and on requesting, they hardly approved of the plan where you would be making the payment on or before 30th October. Moving ahead, i you have exam on 30th October, then you should focus on making the payment before 30th, otherwise, the university may revoke your letter this time. I hope this is understood?
26/10/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 486 2657: Can you please sent account number
14/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 068 4943: How are you everyone
14/11/23, 11:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Prosper!

I hope this message finds you and your family in good spirits. I'm delighted to share that the first installment of the university registration fee has been successfully processed and confirmed by our accounts team. Additionally, we've promptly updated the university officials about this important step in your admission process.

In an effort to ensure transparency and clarity regarding the breakdown of your university registration fee, we've requested a summary from the accounts team. Following thorough coordination, we now have the details ready for you. Please take a moment to review the provided information. If you notice any discrepancies or have any questions, we encourage you to reach out to us. On the other hand, if everything seems accurate and clear, your confirmation and acknowledgment of the received details would be greatly appreciated. <This message was edited>

Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Ashi, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
