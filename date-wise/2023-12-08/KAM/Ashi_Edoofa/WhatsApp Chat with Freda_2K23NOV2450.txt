How are you?
07/12/23, 12:38 pm - +265 999 95 13 02: We're okay, that side?
07/12/23, 12:41 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Pretty good
07/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Noted Freda, Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well. My name is Freda Mbozi. I was born on the third of April 2002. I am 21 years of age. I was born in a family of 3. However we have lived as an extended family of 8 for almost all my life. My father being the first born of his family, he is also is responsible for looking after his other 3 brothers hence totaling to 8 when I include my mother, older brother and little sister. As I was clocking towards 2014. I was lucky enough to be selected to a government school known as Chichiri Secondary School where I did my secondary school (high school) education and was able to complete in 2018. 2019 through the help of my family and other well wishers I started my Bachelor’s Degree program in Business Administration- Management at Malawi Adventist University though the fees gathered was only able to carter for two years. In my Second year I was able to find a part time job where I worked at Lagra Centre Branch as an Administrative assistant from Fridays to Sundays giving me a chance to attend classes during weekdays. Knowing the financial situation we had I would exceed the normal credit hours or courses I was required to take with three 4 extra courses of the upcoming semester on conditions that I do not fail even one course by our academic advisor and head of department which I fulfilled finishing in my 7th semester and not my 8th. I finished in august 2022 but my graduation occurred in July 2023.

The sponsor or rather guardians has been my father but my brother comes in here and there.
07/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey with me. It's evident that you've faced various challenges throughout your academic path, yet your determination and hard work shine through. Congratulations on completing your Bachelor's Degree program in Business Administration-Management at Malawi Adventist University. 

It's heartening to hear about the support from your family, especially your father and brother, as well as other well-wishers. Extended families often provide a strong foundation, and your story reflects the strength that comes from such bonds.

I can imagine the pride your family must feel, and you should be proud of yourself as well. Graduating in July 2023 is a significant accomplishment, and I'm sure it marks the beginning of a new chapter for you. As you move forward, may your education and experiences continue to shape a bright and fulfilling future.
07/12/23, 2:31 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much we really do truly appreciate it.
It’s really been nothing but testimonies
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265996406762, Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention.

You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
07/12/23, 3:24 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok.
07/12/23, 3:25 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: The messages are loud and clear
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
With my counselor we managed to cover four stages. 
Where the first stage look at a brief detail on both ends. Which was mine and Edoofa’s as well. It gave an insight and deep understanding on its goals and what it’s all about. 

Secondly, we have an eligible check where they’re were interviews and other necessary documents and questions 

After Edoofa’s serious consideration, I was luckily enough to be accepted into Edoofa’s scholarship program. Which is the third step.

Lastly, we we’re guided to the right enrollment processes. Which have been fulfilled.

Then the counselor said we leave the rest to here so believe  that’s why this group was made
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and feedback about your counseling session. We're thrilled to see that you have shared such amazing insights with us.
