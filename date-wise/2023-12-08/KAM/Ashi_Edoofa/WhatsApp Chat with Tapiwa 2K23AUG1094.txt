04/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
05/09/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Good Morning
05/09/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Greetings
05/09/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Noted
06/09/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Connected good afternoon
06/09/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/09/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Good afternoon.
Yes we are following
06/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/09/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Loud and clear ma'am
06/09/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

06/09/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/09/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

They are talking about the check points they look at on identifying universities which have a suitable environment for students to pass with flying colours.
07/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 71 342 2739: They are explaining about importance of the statement of purpose on convincing universities why i am worth to be admitted in there school. They went to explain what should be included in the SOP so that i can have a maximum scholarship
07/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
07/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints. <This message was edited>
07/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
08/09/23, 12:11 am - +263 71 342 2739: Okay following
08/09/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tapiwa.

08/09/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Okay we can move forward

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.

11/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Yes

12/09/23, 4:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I understand, in that case, we shall reconnect today at 08.00 pm.
12/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Tapiwa currently is on night shift ,it starts at 8 pm till 7 am next day, so when he is available he will connect with you. My apologies ma'am.
12/09/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/09/23, 9:26 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Connected
12/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/09/23, 6:31 am - +263 71 342 2739: Yes
13/09/23, 6:31 am - +263 71 342 2739: Good morning
13/09/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope you are doing well, By the time you responded, it was past our available working hours, hence we did not get back to you so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
13/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Following
13/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 808 8021: For sure it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities
13/09/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/09/23, 1:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/09/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Connected
13/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
13/09/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Well received
13/09/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we can connect for the discussion now?
14/09/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Connected greetings , at times we are experiencing poor network my apologies.
14/09/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand, may I know if you are clear here?
14/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/09/23, 10:56 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Loud and clear
15/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was attending a meeting may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/09/23, 7:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move forward with the admission process without any delays?
18/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 808 8021: No queries everything is   clear and well explained
18/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Noted and clear
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
18/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 342 2739: Good afternoon.
Noted
18/09/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
18/09/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
18/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Noted ,but i have a request or question
18/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Can the 750  be paid in instalmenta as well
18/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please each and every query of yours will be covered as we move ahead with our discussion, so please do not worry.
18/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
18/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
18/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
18/09/23, 4:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/09/23, 11:19 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Well explained no questions ma'am
19/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Greetings
19/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 808 8021: Greetings
19/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Tapiwa,

I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 01.00 P.M. I hope this time works for you.

22/09/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India.

22/09/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Greetings connected
22/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great to hear that and I am also excited to meet you in person. We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
22/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Great
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
22/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
22/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Very clear Ms kirti
22/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
22/09/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
22/09/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Clear
22/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
22/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
22/09/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Well explained
22/09/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
22/09/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Well explained , great news indeed
22/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
22/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/09/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 7, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 7, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 7, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/09/23, 8:01 am - +263 71 814 2522: Greetings following
25/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Greetings
25/09/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwa.

I hope you are doing well, and had a great weekend, kindly excuse us for not connecting with you earlier, since it was the weekend and we were unavailable. However, we can connect now, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/09/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Connected
25/09/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that may I know if you have any queries so far?
25/09/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 814 2522: No queries everything is clear
25/09/23, 5:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/09/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 814 2522: As for the cost for higher education may you please explain again
25/09/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263718142522 Thank you for your query, do you want me to share the cost breakdown with you again, which was explained above?
25/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Oh I thought it was something that I missed ,   according to your explanation it was clear Ms kirti
25/09/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please, I am glad that you are clear. Now, as Tapiwa's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tapiwa is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/09/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Very excited
25/09/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/09/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Noted
25/09/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. Have a great evening ahead.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
06/10/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
06/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Very clear
06/10/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
06/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Very clear
06/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
06/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Very clear sir
09/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Greetings Milan Singh
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tapiwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
09/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Very clear and much appreciated
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 13th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 13th November 2023.*
09/10/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *13th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
10/10/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tapiwa!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
10/10/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 814 2522: I am in Harare
10/10/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/10/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/10/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Well received thank you
10/10/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
10/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Yes ,may I have the account details again.
10/10/23, 2:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Well received thank you.
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Well explained
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
10/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 814 2522: Very clear
10/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
