04/12/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 945 5781: I have gone through it sir
04/12/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/12/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
04/12/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 945 5781: Ok ok
04/12/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 945 5781: Yes sir

05/12/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 945 5781: Yes sir I am
05/12/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/12/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 945 5781: I am following sir and it is well understood
06/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 945 5781: Sir can I please have the Edoofa Agent number we want to prepare for the balance application fee
06/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule for the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. The reason behind this is that I am doing this for my student’s benefit only.

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
