I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 810 4432: I'm ready
23/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
23/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 810 4432: Ok 
My name is Allen Lawe. Im a young man,18 years of age. I stay with my mum and my 2 siblings one of which is in grade 1 and the other one is doing form 1. I myself am currently doing my L6. My mum works as a Hardware supplier and she'll be the one playing the role of shaping my education plans. She doesn't earn that much but she always makes sacrifices so that my siblings and I can live a better life.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's great to meet you, Allen! It sounds like you're in a family that values education and supports each other's aspirations. Your mother's dedication and sacrifices are truly admirable. As you navigate your educational journey, remember that perseverance and determination can make a significant difference.
23/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know your parents' names and the number they would be using in this group to connect with us?
23/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 810 4432: My mum's name is Tendai Sakaike and her number is
+263 773 650 624
23/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
23/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir we will make sure to inform you
23/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
23/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (1st December) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Tuesday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
23/11/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
23/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir we can move forward
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 810 4432: Um sir the challenge that I'm facing these days is that I'm writing my end of year examinations so most times I won't be available especially during the day due to those exams
23/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I can understand that you are currently in your exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect your exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, you can enhance your study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit your performance in the upcoming exams.
23/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in. 

This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if you are occupied with exams, your parents on your behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here.
23/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir we're on the same page
23/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
23/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Allen 2K23NOV0995)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
23/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Allen EWYL23E0936)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
23/11/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 810 4432: Yes sir I understood
25/11/23, 10:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!
