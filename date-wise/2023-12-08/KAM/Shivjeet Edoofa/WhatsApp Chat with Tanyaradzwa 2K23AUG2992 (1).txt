This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
20/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tanyaradzwa EWYL23E0652)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 490 4026: lam ready sir
27/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 490 4026: done
27/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
27/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 490 4026: very clear
27/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/09/23, 9:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes sure
27/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 490 4026: l am following
27/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 490 4026: very clear sir thank you
27/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes sure,l am ready
27/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
27/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
27/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes sure
27/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

04/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?
04/10/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 490 4026: How are you Sir, m glad you're back and thank you for the knowledge..... l am available for the session aswell
04/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. So may I know if you might be able to give me a brief understanding about the four videos with me?
04/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 490 4026: the first video is where founders were talking about the advantages and qualities of the enrolled students or those students who have earned the Edoofa scholarship programme and the advantages of scholarship credits
04/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 71 490 4026: the second video mainly talks about the difference between an enrolled student from the otyer students who haven't attained the scholarship programme or those who dont have a scholarship
04/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 490 4026: the third video they break down schools,colleges and universities under the Edoofa platform amd how they appreciate students under the Edoofa scholarship programme and apso a brief on how other students are experiencing on these schools or universities
04/10/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, please move on with the fourth video. <This message was edited>
04/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 490 4026: the fourth video literally emphasised on Statement of purpose,its importance and how it is attained
04/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
04/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
04/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
04/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
04/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 490 4026: sorry my network is very bad💔
04/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 490 4026: so from my understanding,the Statement of purpose is a document that allows a student to convince schools why l am worthy being admitted in their school,this where l write my every detail.i.e.abilities,goals and my academic qualifications just toention a few
04/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes Sir we may proceed
04/10/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sorry to say that I will not be further available to proceed with our session for now, as unforeseen work has come up that requires my assistance. Let us connect tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/10/23, 10:40 pm - +263 71 490 4026: Sure,have a blessed night too

09/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.

13/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 490 4026: Qn 2: Explain about BPM(Business Process Management)Lifecycle


 BPM is a systematic approach companies use to design,model,execute,monitor and optimise standard business processes.

DESIGN
When a business start outs it has fewer stakeholders and processes so it will find it easy to lay out the business processes and execute them everyday.
But when you expand,your process begin to fall into predictable patterns.

MODEL
You need to represent the process in a digital format for teams to visualize the workflow sequences and for the workflow engine to understand your instructions,you cannot run a process on pen amd paper,you need to digitize it inorder to flow it through the system and execute or automate it.

EXECUTE
Once you have mapped and illustrated your processes for easy consumption,you need to execute them.But you don't know if your workflows are error free just yet,you need to run them in a testing environment or by a small group of users before making it live.

MONITOR
For sustained process compliance,you need to monitor processes and review processes in real time,you can prevent potential bottlenecks and spot  improvement opportunities.Business process monitoring is a vital step in the BPM lifecycle as its benefits are more than successful problem prevention.

OPTIMISE
With a proper monitoring system in place ,you can drive operations towards optimization and process improvement.
Business process optimisation refers to the use of vital metrics and measurements to revisit and optimise the existing processes.
13/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 490 4026: Qn3:How does a business contribute to economic development?
Businesses contribute a lot to economic development be it a small business,multinational etcThey contribute both positively and ne atively.Once you have started a business say which produces blankets,you will increase competition to other companies that have been in the market for a while which will increase the government's revenue also there will be availability of locally produced goods to consumers  and insome way this leads to economic development.
There will be employment creation in the area where the business is operating which will raise peoples standards of living thus they will be paid and able to pay for their bills and education which in some way contributes to economic development.If people get employment in companies which operate in an area this will give them skills,knowledge on how to run the business,so individuals may open their own firms and start operating individually which will cause an increasi in tax payment thus income to the economy,even GDP is increased efficiently.
13/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 490 4026: QN5: Explain the importance of Human Resource Management in an organisation.

The HR makes sure employees feel supported,satisfied and motivated so that they put in their best work everyday and become productive thus motivated employees make your business meet its quarterly goals and continue to grow and produce great products.
The HR also work well with people and understand what motivates them to put in their best work .He takes the responsibility of training, development, compliance and employee productivity off the hands of the leadership team,allowing them to focus on what they do best.
Federal and state laws governing employment and employee safety can be complex,HR managers understand these laws and make sure to keep the company in compliance both to avoid fees and penalties and to create a workplace environment where everyone can feel safe and valued.
13/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 490 4026: Can you please elaborate question 4 for me l can't seem to understand

14/10/23, 8:33 am - +263 71 490 4026: question 5....l answered that one
14/10/23, 8:36 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pease excuse me for the error here. Sure! The question is asking you to explain a time in your life when you demonstrated good management skills. For instance, it's like sharing a story from your past where you had to organize, lead, or handle a situation effectively.

For example, let's say you were the captain of a sports team. You could talk about how you organized practices, motivated your team, and made decisions during games. This would demonstrate your skills in leadership, organization, and decision-making.
14/10/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 490 4026: okay okay, it's clear now
14/10/23, 8:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. Please do let me know by when you might be able to answer the said questions with me.

14/10/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 490 4026: thank you Mr Shivjeet
14/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 490 4026: Qn4

Back in high school l was a Junior Councilor and a prefect,so as a junior councilor it was my duty to make sure l develop the school interms of access to water, Wi-Fi just to mention a few,so that students will feel safe and to make education easier and reliable to students.So l usually had meetings with my fellow Junior Councillors from other schools where we will be discussing issues concerning our schools and how to tackle them and after such meetings l would announce whatever l discussed to the teachers, students and the head of the school then from those l would volunteer students to state whatever they need to be developed at the school,and with the assistance of the teachers we would do a fund raising at the premises and raise the funds to do whatever that has to be done.

So inshort that is when l practiced my managerial skills where l would order around people to do tasks.l also practiced my leadership skills where l was the owner of the project,people would come and ask what to do next and stuff...l also practiced other skills like time management

17/10/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BBA and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
17/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes,it is correct
17/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
17/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 490 4026: lam ready Sir
17/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
17/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
17/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
17/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
17/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 490 4026: clearly yes
17/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
17/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
17/10/23, 5:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
17/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected @263714904026
17/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yeah l familiar with this
17/10/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
17/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 490 4026: lam available,my network was a bit trippy
17/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes Sir
17/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
17/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
17/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
17/10/23, 10:25 pm - +263 71 490 4026: noted
17/10/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late and my available hours are coming to an end, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow at 3:00 pm. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 490 4026: done
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 490 4026: quite an advantage, following
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes yes l get it...following
18/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay if my registration fee is 750 l will pay 600,then on my yearly tution 750 will be deducted...am l correct
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct.
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay.
18/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 490 4026: no this is very clear
18/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 71 490 4026: familiarize me with it
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
18/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 490 4026: very clear we may proceed
18/10/23, 4:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 490 4026: we discussed about this one
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes
18/10/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 490 4026: option 2 is better
18/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes it is clear
18/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 490 4026: very clear,so soon after the diploma in 2024,l will be able to persue my bachelors in 2025
18/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 490 4026: whilst l will be doing my diploma will l be part of the Edoofa scholarship programme?
18/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed.
18/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 71 490 4026: no , let's proceed
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes lam looking forward to it
18/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
18/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay no problem
14/11/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening dear parents and Tanyaradzwa

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.

15/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay okay l just wanted to confirm
15/11/23, 6:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, I'm glad you confirmed that. Now, let's delve into the details of the offer letter. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?

15/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
15/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 490 4026: eagerly waiting on that
15/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions that is tomorrow as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon as it is late here. So, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
15/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay sure,have a great night
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Tanyaradzwa!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 243 2633: Afternoon  Mr Shivjeet, Tanyaradzwa is not available now his mobile phone is flat , we are facing electricity problems nowadays in Zimbabwe,  however l hope he will get in touch as soon his phone get charged, sorry for the inconvenience
16/11/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries at all! I understand that electricity issues can cause disruptions sometimes. I hope the situation gets better soon. In the meantime, as this is also a family discussion group, we could also proceed with the parents. So, if you are comfortable, shall we proceed with the session?
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 243 2633: Yes, go ahead  sir
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Come to my last message may I know if you might be able to give me the answers to the above questions?
16/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping a response from your end. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
17/11/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 490 4026: Good morning Mr Shivjeet, sorry l wasn't available yesterday
17/11/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 490 4026: l couldn't catch up due eo to electricity problems this side
17/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 490 4026: 1.$0
2.$0
3.$1250
4.$250($125 each)
5.$1000
17/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 490 4026: very clear
17/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 490 4026: so about the payment plan on the registration fee?
17/11/23, 2:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your enthusiasm. I am coming to that now. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
17/11/23, 2:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Tanyaradzwa through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 490 4026: elaborate please
17/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yhaa it is very clear now
17/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @263714904026. 
Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 490 4026: yes lam in Harare
17/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay thank you
17/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 490 4026: if hez trustworthy we will do the same
17/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 71 490 4026: okay sure
17/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
17/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
