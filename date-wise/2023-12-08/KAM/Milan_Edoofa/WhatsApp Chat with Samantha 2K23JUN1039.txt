However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Samantha's higher education?

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather.

11/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 335 7360: <Media omitted>

11/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes you can go ahead
11/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 335 7360: You are welcome @917292063289
11/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yaa i do remember some of them
11/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
11/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 319 9891: I do understand that she will be on the eaney will you learn program we will be paying party of the fee's
11/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understand, may I know if you recall anything related to the registration fee?
11/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 319 9891: On her visa to india we will be helped by the indian embassy hre in Zimbabwe
11/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 319 9891: About the registration fees we first paid 388 as the inrollment fees
11/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, $750 is the registration fee and it is a one-time payable fee which is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
11/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 319 9891: After that if accepted we will pay $750
11/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes that is clear
11/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
11/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
11/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
11/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Ok thank you for sharing such information to us as a family
11/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
11/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
11/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
11/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes I have reviewed them
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
11/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Samantha, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
11/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Okay
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
11/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes it does resonate Kirti
11/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Thank you for asking
11/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
11/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
11/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes it does
11/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
11/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
11/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
11/10/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Know i do understand
11/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Here i need your help
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
11/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
11/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yaa
11/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Sorry Kirti how long is our session going to take im tired now
11/10/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that you must be tried in that case, we can continue tomorrow at 12:30 pm.
11/10/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Ok no problem thank you for the time we head been discussing
11/10/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Good night Kirti
11/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome and have a blessed night @263773199891
11/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Thank you
12/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that must be occupied with work, it is completely alright, we can connect at 08:00 pm today to continue with our discussion.
12/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Good evening everyone i hope this message finds you well
12/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening @263773199891 it is a pleasure to connect with you again. May I know if you are available for a discussion?
12/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes i am available
12/10/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great so may I know if you are clear so far?
12/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yaa everything is clear if their is any problem i will ask
12/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
12/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yaa that's correct
12/10/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
12/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 319 9891: I'm noting
12/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
12/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
12/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes that is quite clear
12/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
12/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
12/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes we are
12/10/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
12/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Ok i do understand but she is aming high
12/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure she is and she will make you proud. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
12/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yaa my question is based on food how is going to manage food and accomodation
12/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand. Once you receive the offer letter, from the scholarship quantum to accommodation, and food, all will be mentioned, please do not worry about that and everything will be discussed in detail after receiving the offer letter.
12/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Hoo ok
12/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Samantha's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that samantha is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
12/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Yes I'm excited
12/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 319 9891: For my daughter to secure a place in the Edoofa scholarship
12/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
12/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 319 9891: Okay thank you hope I will manage to pay for my daughter 's higher education
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Samantha.

19/10/23, 10:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, shall we move ahead to discuss about the course that we were doing?
20/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 335 7360: Hello Sir how are you doing today, its unfortunate that waited for you yesterday and you didnt show up

20/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Hello Sir how are you
20/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Which one exactly
20/10/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is fine dear. Shall we now move ahead with the discussion dear?
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Yes Sir
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, we were discussing about your course Samantha. Since you had interest in two different fields, if I may ask which one are you more interested in?

20/10/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, can you please share with me in detail about why is it that you wish to pursue a course in that field as well as your career aspirations too?

20/10/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, I would like to share some insights about the BBA course you were initially interested in. The field of Business Administration (BBA) offers great career opportunities and is highly marketable. BBA graduates have a wide range of job prospects and can work in various industries, including marketing, finance, human resources, and more. With a BBA degree, you can potentially earn a higher salary compared to some other fields. I hope you are following?
20/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 335 7360: Yes im following
20/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding, Samantha. Now, since you had initially expressed interest in the BBA course and have some valuable skills in entrepreneurship and business, there's a way to merge your passion for social work with a business-oriented degree.

Have you considered specializing in Business Administration with a focus on Social Entrepreneurship or Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)? This specialization combines business principles with social impact, allowing you to work for organizations that are dedicated to making a positive difference in society. I hope you are following?
21/10/23, 6:26 am - +263 71 335 7360: Yes Sir im following
21/10/23, 6:26 am - +263 71 335 7360: Good morning to you all.
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Samantha!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 4:56 am - +263 71 335 7360: Here we are doing great.
