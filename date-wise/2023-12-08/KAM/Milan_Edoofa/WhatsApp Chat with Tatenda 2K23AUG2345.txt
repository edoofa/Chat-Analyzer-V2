29/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups. Moving forward, It's reassuring to hear that.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring he has access to the finest opportunities to launch his career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

30/08/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 040 6011: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 040 6011: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, That is alright, Thank you for sharing the counseling feedback form and the EWYL Program pledge form, it is duly noted with us. Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
30/08/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir i am available
30/08/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
30/08/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir we can start
30/08/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir i am done
30/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
30/08/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir they are clear
30/08/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/08/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
30/08/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir i am following
30/08/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/08/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/08/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir they are clear
30/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
30/08/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir we may proceed 

But I just want to clarify something first before we move on


The Admission team is the one that processes both my SOP  and  VISA application??
30/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed you are correct.
30/08/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir

Let’s proceed
30/08/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
30/08/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
30/08/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
30/08/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir am ready
30/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
30/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

30/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
30/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
30/08/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
30/08/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 040 6011: On this video i have understood that I should be open minded and also I should follow instructions
30/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the other videos.
30/08/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 040 6011: In this video i have understood that edoofa was established to deliver higher education at affordable prices  and aslo it helps the students attain more Skills through the earn while you learn program. The edoofa program is also there with a vision of increasing the capacity of students to hold success
30/08/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Sorry sir for the late replies 

My network is a bit slow on downloading the videos
30/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I shall wait for your response, to the rest of the videos.
30/08/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 040 6011: From this forth video I understand that  on the SOP  the student must. Show his or her strength , vision  aswell as academic progress and it is the only subjective opportunity
30/08/23, 9:32 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Sir i am having trouble downloading the third video
30/08/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that in that case, let me share the audio version of the video 3.
30/08/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir
30/08/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared it, you can go through it now and share your understanding of the same.
30/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir it’s downloading
30/08/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I shall wait for your response.
30/08/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 040 6011: As per this audio i have understood  that  with edoofa on my side I should not be worried about which school am I going to because edoofa offers the best schools in Inda and   Also the EWYL program is applicable to any school you choose
30/08/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
30/08/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
30/08/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
30/08/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir thats true
30/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*

The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle is a continuous series of steps that organizations use to improve their business processes in order to achieve better efficiency and effectiveness. The BPM life cycle typically includes the following phases:

1. Design: This phase involves identifying and documenting the current business processes, analyzing them to identify areas for improvement, and designing new or revised processes that meet the organization's needs.

2. Modeling: In this phase, the new or revised processes are modeled using process modeling tools to create visual representations of how the processes will work.

3. Execution: This phase involves implementing the new or revised processes in the organization's systems and training employees on how to use them.

4. Monitoring: Once the new processes are implemented, they need to be monitored to ensure they are working as intended and to identify any issues or areas for further improvement.

5. Optimization: Based on the monitoring results, the processes can be optimized by making incremental improvements and adjustments over time.

6. Automation: Finally, when the processes have been optimized, they can be automated using technology tools such as workflow management software and other automation tools to increase efficiency and reduce errors.

 Overaly, the BPM life cycle is an ongoing process, with each phase building on the previous one to continuously improve processes and achieve better outcomes

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and the O- level results. It is duly noted with us. May I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form by now?
01/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Afternoon  sir how are you today
01/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes I managed to fill the sop form and I submitted it
01/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
01/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
01/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
01/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir
01/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir
01/09/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
01/09/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir i am ready
01/09/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
01/09/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
01/09/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
01/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir
01/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
01/09/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
01/09/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Noted sir
02/09/23, 7:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tatenda.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded, it was past our available hours, so we could not get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/09/23, 7:58 am - +263 78 040 6011: Morning sir how are you
02/09/23, 7:58 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ohhh thats ok sir


Yes i am available
02/09/23, 8:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. So may I know if you are clear here?
02/09/23, 8:09 am - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir  the i was clear with the fees and how they are paid
02/09/23, 8:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're clear. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
02/09/23, 8:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
02/09/23, 8:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
02/09/23, 8:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/09/23, 8:28 am - +263 78 040 6011: Sir can i ask something 

So does this mean that  i pay the registration fee and also the visa fee and the flight expenses or the edoofa program covers all that too
02/09/23, 8:29 am - +263 78 040 6011: After I have arrived in inda or before I even go
02/09/23, 8:30 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir
02/09/23, 8:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263780406011 thank you for your queries let me help you understand. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself. The tickets are to be booked after one gets their visa from the embassy and the visa would cost $83.
02/09/23, 8:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now addressing your very first query regarding the registration fee, let me help you understand. The registration fee of  $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
02/09/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir
02/09/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir 

So i have to process my visa and flight tickets  personally
02/09/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, however, through the process we will be assisting you.
02/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir 

Thank you for the clarification
02/09/23, 9:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

I hope you are doing well, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was occupied with some personal reasons, however, now without any further delay, we shall move forward, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Afternoon  Sir how are you
07/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes I am available
07/09/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
07/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 040 6011: No sir  we have no queries
07/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Sir my grandfather wants to be part of the program. Can I add him?
07/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please go ahead, and you grandfather to the group as well.
07/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
07/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir
07/09/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please.
07/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 040 6011: No sir I wasn’t aware of it
07/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for adding your grandfather. 

I understand Tatenda, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
07/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
07/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir
07/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 040 6011: That’s  very true
07/09/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
07/09/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 698 5595 was added
08/09/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tatenda.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from your side, however, you did not respond, so may I know if you are able to connect with us now?
08/09/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 698 5595: Yes I able to connect. How are you
08/09/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. So may I know if you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
08/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Good afternoon sir 


The thing is that I went to school on Tuesday  thats why i am not available mots of the time because i will be attending lessons from 7:30 am to 13:00 pm then i go for lunch and resume lesson from 14 :00 upto 16:00 pm
08/09/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that you must be busy with the lessons, in that case it is completely alright for your parents to attend the discussions on your behalf.
08/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir I will tell them
08/09/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, in the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us?
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir i am
08/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
08/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir
08/09/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
08/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 040 6011: No sir I wasn’t aware of it
08/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
08/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
08/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir thank you for the clarification
08/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
08/09/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
08/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir it is
09/09/23, 10:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tatenda.

09/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 040 6011: Morning sir how are you today
09/09/23, 11:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I hope you are doing well too, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir i am available
09/09/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now, moving forward. 

2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/09/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/09/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 040 6011: Yea sir
09/09/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/09/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Noted
09/09/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/09/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/09/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes i have followed 



Sir i can you  please clarify something for me.  So if i receive the letter of intent  does that mean that i will not be able to choose which university to go
11/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tatenda.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we could not get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Evening  sir how are you today
11/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir i am available
11/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
11/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Not exactly sir
11/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Sir can you  please clarify something for me.  So if i receive the letter of intent  does that mean that i will not be able to choose which university to go
11/09/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I was getting to that query of yours, Let me help you understand, no, since we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities, and as time, we will receive offer letters from those universities, one by one, then we will assist you with your university selection as to whichever is the best university according to your preference.

I hope you are clear now?
11/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir 

Thank you for the clarification
11/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, now Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
11/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 040 6011: You can provide more information sir
11/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
11/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
11/09/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
11/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 040 6011: It is well noted sir
11/09/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 040 6011: So  when exactly can one initiate their admission process befor their results are out
11/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir . So in that case  will they be able to pursue a deploma ??
11/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your queries @263780406011 as we move forward both your queries will be answered, shall we move ahead?
11/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir we can move ahead
11/09/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
11/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Well giving up is never an option . So will the diploma course have the same duration as the degree course
11/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263780406011 a diploma degree is also a 3-year course.
11/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
11/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir
11/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
11/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
11/09/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir
11/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
11/09/23, 10:36 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Noted
11/09/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
11/09/23, 10:41 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir they are all clear. We can proceed
11/09/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. We shall reconnect tomorrow same time, please make sure that your parents are available to connect as well.
11/09/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok sir i will remind them
11/09/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night.
11/09/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Same to you sir
12/09/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tatenda. 

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Good evening sir . We are ok
12/09/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well. I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
12/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Thank you sir. We discussed as a family and we are happy with the advantages of early decision benefit because if his results are below the required 2E grades , he can perdue a diploma first then continue with his bachelors
12/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
12/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
12/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Yes sir we are on the same page. There is no going back in our decision
12/09/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
12/09/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
12/09/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Yes sir it's clear. How much time do they normally give for us to pay the required registration fee?
12/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, I shall help you understand that as we move forward with our discussion.
12/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
12/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Yes sir we can go ahead
12/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 12th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 27th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Yes I am clear on this
12/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
12/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
12/09/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 12th of September, the deadline becomes the 27th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 12th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 27th of September 2023, making the second deadline the 27th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
12/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Yes sir we are on the same page. And I think the Early Registration/ Admission process is better . It easy to work with regarding our situation hear in Zimbabwe
12/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
12/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 330 4638: I am pleased with the second option sir because it gives us ample time to organize the funds . Unlike the first option which will have only 15days to do final payment
12/09/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
12/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Admission process start from the day the parents gave you go ahead and make sure they are mentally and financially prepared for the next step
12/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 330 4638: There are 2 ways to proceed with the admission process
1) Standard Registration/ Admission process where by once you get the offer letter from the University you are given 15 days to make full payment of admission fee.
2) Early Registration / Admission process is whereby once you get the offer letter from the University you are given 15days to pay half of the admission fee and and 1 month to pay the balance
12/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
12/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Yes sir we are clear on that. Can we start the registration process from the first of October sir ?
12/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773304638 everything will be explained in detail, sir.

Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
12/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *27th September* and *27th October*.
12/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *27th September* and *27th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Tatenda's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
12/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Ok sir . Let's go ahead with the registration process that I have chosen
12/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, however, please note that the Early Decision Benefits are only  for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September.
12/09/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Tatenda's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities?
12/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Let us Go ahead  with the Application sir
12/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Tatenda's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *27th September* and *27th October*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
12/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Yes sir . I will do what it takes to give my son better education
12/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are so dedicated to your son's higher education. Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Tatenda's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Tatenda's higher education well.
12/09/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 330 4638: Ok sir , Thank you so much 👏🏿👏🏿
12/09/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome @263773304638 . 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

22/09/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier regarding the last message that I have shared here in this group. Hence, can you please let me know by when can we reconnect and continue with our discussion here?
25/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 040 6011: 1.900
2. 3 years (6 semesters 
3. 300
4.750
26/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tatenda!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
26/09/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 330 4638: Yes sir . It's clear now
26/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
26/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
26/09/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Noted sir
26/09/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Sir i want to ask something  regarding the registration fee 


Is it paid once or it can be paid in two  sessions
26/09/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Tatenda, we will discuss this moving ahead during our sessions, for now, may I know if you are clear till here?
26/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes sir everything is well explained
26/09/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?

28/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Afternoon sir  how are you today
