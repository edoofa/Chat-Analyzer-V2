08/09/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. How are you doing today?
30/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parent.

I have received an insight that you wanted to inquire about Anodiwa's admission process and payment. However, I was hoping to discuss the same with you here in the admission group. Unfortunately with repeated reminders I received no response from your end. So if you are currently available now. Shall we proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now. I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, I would only requires one hour of your time for our session, and with pure consistency, we can easily wrap it up during that time frame.
02/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I would like to inform you that there are certain opportunities awaiting your admission process that will be of great help to your finances. This opportunity has been greatly appreciated by your fellow peers and their parents, and I would not like you to miss out on it as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.*
06/11/23, 6:05 am - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you Sheevjet for your kind gesture. Am sorry for the inc9nveniences that couod have been caused by our inconsistences as regards attending our admissions sessions. We as Anodiwa's proud Edoof8an parents mentioned earlier that we are sole traders usually we are always out of network working from hand to mouth. Anything that requires out attention as parents might have slipped through the fingers mostly because we will either be out of data or network. Im.usually driving nearly daily for the most part of the day do in Zimbabwe we experience serious intermittent internet network problems. However am sure ad from the *16th of November 2023* Anodiwa will vlbe through with her final examinations and we as her parents would be prepared to proceed with the 1hour sessions without any problems. Please kindly bear with us and allow us to proceed with the sessions as from the 16th of November 2023. Thank you in advance👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
06/11/23, 6:08 am - +263 71 291 4917: However, as I  asked from Saloni earlier on, we are prepared to get a copy of our great daughter's admission breakdown so we can schedule all the payments plan in advance as we await her final results.
06/11/23, 12:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding and for providing this update. I completely understand that you may have some challenges due to network issues and your busy schedules. It's great to hear that Anodiwa will be finishing her final examinations on the 16th of November 2023, and you'll be ready to proceed with the sessions after that date.

Regarding your request for Anodiwa's admission breakdown, we can certainly provide you with that information. When we proceed with the session.
06/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 291 4917: Thank you. We will surely await to get all finer details as  early as possible 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
06/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You're very welcome, and we appreciate your patience.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
