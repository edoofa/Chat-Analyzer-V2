04/08/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Lorent!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse us for not being able to reach out to you in the past few days since the team was occupied with the arrivals of the first batch here in India.
04/08/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, thank you for sharing your thoughts on Lorent's admission here with me. Regarding that, can you please also let me know how much amount are you planning to raise by 10th of August 2023 towards Lorent's admission fee so that on the basis of the same, we can discuss and plan the way ahead for his higher education?
04/08/23, 10:45 am - +265 988 29 83 70: It's okie we understand
04/08/23, 10:46 am - +265 988 29 83 70: Alright we're planning to raise the sum of $100
04/08/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that. Now, since you will be raising the $100 by 10th of August, and I believe you are aware that in order to complete your registration, you will have to pay the $500-750 registration fee. So, let us assume that your registration fee comes to be $750, then by when do you think you will be able to raise the remaining $650 after having raised the $100 please?
04/08/23, 1:05 pm - +265 988 29 83 70: You're welcome, well, on that I can't jus talk about the remaining amount. May you pliz give us some time so that we can discuss about it cuz as for Mrs Elizabeth Mwiriha is offline so she's our mother and we can't jus decide anyhow unless if we get in touch with her and we give you the response later,
Thank you
04/08/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is completely fine dear, you can take your time to have a discussion with them and come up with a plan that suits your preparations. Regarding that, may I know by when can I expect a response from your side please?
04/08/23, 1:15 pm - +265 988 29 83 70: Thanks for your understanding, perhaps during the weekend or before the weekend it will depend sir
04/08/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, so does that mean we should connect with each other by tomorrow for that?

I hope you are doing well today.
07/08/23, 9:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Lorent, as per the discussion that we had earlier, may I know if you were able to have a discussion with you parents about the plan for raising your registration fee amount?
07/08/23, 9:24 am - +265 988 29 83 70: Yes we had the discussions and we agreed that we will first pay the $100 and start with other processes and we shall finish the rest whilst Lorent is in India .
07/08/23, 9:49 am - +265 994 86 48 23: And the mode of payment will be through Rands ,,,my brother in South Africa will pay directly to your associates ...we discussed this with MR Austin ...so he said that we will get the details from you sir !
07/08/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, if I am getting you right, you are planning to pay $100 by 10th of August and the rest after Lorent comes to India, is that so?
07/08/23, 10:24 am - +265 994 86 48 23: Yes sir it is
07/08/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case can you please also help me understand why is it that you are planning to raise the rest of the registration fee amount after your arrival here in India?
07/08/23, 10:36 am - +265 988 29 83 70: We are aiming at securing the seat for the university and considering the time we want him to attend the classes and in due course we'll be raising the fee and be sending ,,, currently we can't afford to do it all due to devaluation in our country currently hence the reason behind plan
08/08/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Lorent!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/08/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I completely understand that, however, in that case, I would like to mention that in order to complete Lorent's admission process and move ahead to the next steps, i.e. the VISA Process and travel process, the admission letter of the student is required and for us to get that, it is mandatory to complete the registration process first. I hope you understand.
08/08/23, 3:13 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Of course yes we understand sir

10/08/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the confusion here. Yes, please I was meaning to say about your brother please. Now, in that case, can you connect with him now and ask if he will be making the payment through Mama Money so that I can get the order generated for that now and he would be able to make the payment by tomorrow.
10/08/23, 4:35 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Alright sir let me contact him
10/08/23, 4:36 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: In other ways can I just share with you his contact number so that you can inquire him for yourself?
10/08/23, 4:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Will he be available as of now for a discussion?
10/08/23, 4:41 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: To be honest I don't know how free he is so maybe when you get in touch he can tell you if he's ready but he has been waiting since morning
10/08/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is why I was suggesting you to have a call with him and then let me know.
10/08/23, 4:42 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Alright please sir I will do so
10/08/23, 4:44 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Can we proceed with the conversation whilst am contacting the brother?
10/08/23, 4:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Lorent please check with him first and then on the basis of that we will move ahead.
10/08/23, 4:48 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Alright sir I get your point
10/08/23, 4:53 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Malih.vcf (file attached)
10/08/23, 4:54 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: He said you should contact him at 07:30 pm CAT .... because he knows the app but he's not familiar with it but if you can guide him he can actually do that ...so that's it sir ....I hope you would be able to connect with him on time?
10/08/23, 4:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Lorent your brother does not have to make the payment through App dear, we will generate the order for making the payment for him and then he will have to visit a Mama Money Outlet to pay the money in cash and then the payment will be done. I hope this is clear?
10/08/23, 5:00 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: But sir where he stays is far from shopprite etc ....and  ithink the use of the app is quite easy mode ....it's just simple when you connect with him and make orders so that he can use the app ...
10/08/23, 5:01 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Would that going to be possible?
10/08/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Lorent, we can only create the order using the App dear, the payment has to be made from one of the Mama Money outlets please.
10/08/23, 5:03 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: In consideration of his work and restrictions given by him he thought it better to have the money in his account so that he can use the mode payment ...so ithink you will take this consideration sir
10/08/23, 5:06 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: If you can advise him he can do that and if igot him well he said that he knows the app but he has nvr used it before but he assured that if he is told what to do then it's simple to do that .... that is nwhy itold you that you can guide him when you connect him
10/08/23, 5:13 pm - +265 994 86 48 23: Would that going to be possible sir ?
