I hope this message finds you well. I have been wanting to connect with you to carry forward Tabo's admission process ahead for his higher education in India. Since you were informed at the start the process is to be completed within 4 days of time, and it has been a week since we did not hear back from you. 

I noticed that you were able to go through my messages, and hence I feel something has been bothering you because of which you have not been active in your admission group. If I may ask, may I know what happened? Have you been facing some kind of challenges?

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/08/23, 9:39 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes
04/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 9:44 pm - +260 96 0756851: Yes you can start
04/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
04/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - +260 96 0756851: Yes they are.
04/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 10:04 pm - +260 96 0756851: Following
04/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
04/08/23, 10:10 pm - +260 96 0756851: Yes they are clear
04/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
04/08/23, 10:11 pm - +260 96 0756851: Yes
04/08/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
04/08/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
04/08/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
04/08/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

04/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
04/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
04/08/23, 10:27 pm - +260 96 4140979: Tomorrow same time, have a good night

05/08/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
05/08/23, 10:41 am - +260 96 0756851: Yes we did
05/08/23, 10:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
05/08/23, 10:59 am - +260 96 4140979: 1 arriving of enrolled edoofer students, advise on following instructions and being open minded. 2founders of edoofer sharing vision on how to be successful students, responsible and independent 3.founders insure that learners are provided with good universities and colleges and encourages them to work hard and follow instructions to be better people and responsible in future
05/08/23, 11:07 am - +260 96 4140979: 4.statement of purpose the student should fill the form  being interactive for them to secure good scholarships
05/08/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. 	
I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
05/08/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
05/08/23, 11:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
05/08/23, 2:15 pm - +260 96 0756851: Understood
08/08/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tabo.

08/08/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
08/08/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

14/08/23, 9:06 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sure
14/08/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
14/08/23, 9:11 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes
14/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
14/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
14/08/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sure
14/08/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
14/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
14/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
14/08/23, 9:14 pm - +260 96 4140979: True
14/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $1200-$1800 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
14/08/23, 9:20 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes it's understood
14/08/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
14/08/23, 9:27 pm - +260 96 4140979: Clear
14/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 9:29 pm - +260 96 4140979: Following
14/08/23, 9:29 pm - +260 96 0756851: Understood
14/08/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
14/08/23, 9:33 pm - +260 96 0756851: Have you finalised the SOP or still working on it?
14/08/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The evaluation will be done by Wednesday since tomorrow is a National holiday in India, so we will not be able to do evaluate tomorrow, also Tabo's year of intake is August 2024, so his registration process will also commence after August 2023.

I hope we are clear here?
14/08/23, 9:41 pm - +260 96 4140979: Clear
14/08/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Wednesday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well. <This message was edited>

23/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - +260 96 0756851: 1.Message from the founder which is an explicitly on how to be an Adoofan.
2. SOP statement of purpose is a document that makes us convince the university or board why  Tabo is worth a place in the University. 
3. Counselling sessions with experienced Adoofa academic officers.
4.offer letter, the Adoofa experts will send applications to various recommended  universities.
5. Registration and Admission: Once we receive the letter of intent and paid the required amount  then we receive University  acceptance  letter of admission. 
6. Visa application. As  soon  as  we have the acceptance letter in our hand then the admission team eill assist on visa acquisition.
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level/ grade 12 Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +260 96 4140979: Noted
25/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tabo, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 4:38 pm - +260 96 4140979: Following
25/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:41 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sure it does
25/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 4:51 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sure
25/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/10/23, 4:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 4:58 pm - +260 96 4140979: Following
25/10/23, 4:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/10/23, 5:01 pm - +260 96 4140979: inform us please
25/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
25/10/23, 11:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tabo,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
26/10/23, 2:26 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sure though am at work
26/10/23, 2:29 pm - +260 96 4140979: We can proceed
26/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
26/10/23, 3:19 pm - +260 96 4140979: Very clear
26/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) 45% passing marks in grade 12, in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/10/23, 3:20 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 3:22 pm - +260 96 4140979: Following
26/10/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 3:27 pm - +260 96 4140979: Clear
26/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 3:30 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sure
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

Let's begin our efforts to ensure that tabo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment.

30/10/23, 5:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. However, we shall share the application with the university when you have shared the grade 12 examination timetable.
30/10/23, 5:18 pm - +260 96 4140979: Noted thanks

16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tabo,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 8:14 pm - +260 96 0756851: Thank you  
We will need some clarifications or questions on the letter  and would like to hear your advice and guidance.
16/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
16/11/23, 8:31 pm - +260 96 0756851: Question
1.Usd 350
2. Zero fees after sponsorship
3. Usd 1600 yearly 
4.UsD 125 one time payable
5.Usd 1000 one time
16/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/11/23, 8:44 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes it is
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
16/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
16/11/23, 9:05 pm - +260 96 0756851: What about the 15 days period to for securing for the place from the date of offer letter?
16/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we will be discussing the same as we move ahead.  I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and I'll be answering your concern tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:24 pm - +260 96 4140979: Ok and have a pleasant night
16/11/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: thank you.
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tabo.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 6:47 pm - +260 96 4140979: Good evening, hope you are doing fine
17/11/23, 6:48 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sorry we had a busy day
17/11/23, 6:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great it is alright please I understand may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/11/23, 7:16 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes we are available
17/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear here?
17/11/23, 7:19 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes we are clear
17/11/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Tabo's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/11/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 7:22 pm - +260 96 4140979: Following
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
17/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
17/11/23, 7:26 pm - +260 96 4140979: Clear
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - +260 96 4140979: Sure it does
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
17/11/23, 7:45 pm - +260 96 0756851: That means once the fiest year usd 1850 is paid we  will be paying usd 350 annually?
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the above message?
17/11/23, 8:56 pm - +260 96 4140979: Yes we did
17/11/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am
18/11/23, 8:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tabo,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 9:55 am - +260 96 0756851: Yes we can connect
Hope you a well  too.
18/11/23, 10:05 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, thank you for asking, I am feeling better now so may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 10:26 am - +260 96 4140979: Clear
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $1200 to $1800 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
18/11/23, 10:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($1200 to $1800).
18/11/23, 10:30 am - +260 96 4140979: Okay
18/11/23, 10:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
18/11/23, 10:42 am - +260 96 4140979: Sure
18/11/23, 10:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Tabo is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
18/11/23, 10:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
18/11/23, 10:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
18/11/23, 10:47 am - +260 96 4140979: Sure the same scholarship we ve gotten is okay
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 30th, 2023*.
18/11/23, 11:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 11:06 am - +260 96 4140979: Please
18/11/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 30, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 30, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 30, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 11:30 am - +260 96 4140979: Yes please
18/11/23, 11:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zambia, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 11:31 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, most of the students from Zambia prefer to process the payment through our associate Mr. Hammond (Penmal Connect) since it is more convenient and the transfer charges are only 5% of the amount you want to send. 

May I know if you would be able to use the same mode to process the payment of your registration fee as well?
18/11/23, 11:35 am - +260 96 4140979: Will get back to you on this one
18/11/23, 12:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let me share the accounts details just for your refernce:

*Account Name* - Penmal Connect Limited
*Account Number* - 0222030000591
*Name of Bank* - Indo Zambia Bank
*Branch Name* - Jacaranda
*Sort Code* - 090122
*Swift Code* - INZAZMLX
18/11/23, 12:02 pm - +260 96 4140979: Thanks noted
18/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - +260 96 4140979: It's clear,I want to know is food provided or its self catering also concerning A levels and visa
18/11/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with the food here. The university will provide you with the opportunity to cook your own food at your accommodation, which means you have the liberty to eat your home-cooked meals. It will cost the students a monthly expense of $40 to $50 to gather groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university, giving you affordability and convenience too. I hope I am clear on this?
18/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your concern regarding the grade 12 and visa?
18/11/23, 12:42 pm - +260 96 0756851: He has done O levels here what about the Alevels part
18/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes,if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
18/11/23, 12:45 pm - +260 96 0756851: Clear, and then Adoofa will also organise visa?
18/11/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @260960756851 we will be guiding you through the visa process please, so that you do need to hurry at the end time, we would be guiding you as to what documents would be required for you to attain the visa.
18/11/23, 12:48 pm - +260 96 0756851: We are asking so that we get prepared of all hidden costs that may arise
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern as a parent here, and I hope you are clear now?
18/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.
20/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tabo.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond despite our reach out on Saturday, may I know if you are facing any challenges, I would appreciate it if you share your challenge with us transparently?
20/11/23, 6:55 pm - +260 96 0756851: We are all well hope you are, we just wanted to know of any other fees / costs if they are any so that we are aware and plan for them
20/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please, there is no other expenses apart from the travel and visa which is just a one-time investment.
20/11/23, 9:29 pm - +260 96 4140979: Okay noted

The indo bank rate is K23.86 per dollar abd your agents rate is K24.56 per dolla you advise us before we deposit because its now proving expensive, the saving for scholarship is getting eaten up through these hidden costs , I propose in future we pay direct into the MV University account to avoid agents charges because we have 4 years of these payments.
Advise.
