02/11/23, 7:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 7:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes they are
02/11/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes lam
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?

02/11/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/11/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

03/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 355 9768: Lastly , on the last video the core founders were telling me of the statement of purpose and how important it is . It paves a way for me to be enrolled by a certain university. I aso got into mind that l  should take a one full hour in answering or filling the document. That's all , l thank you .
03/11/23, 10:30 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding and takeaways from the videos, Eve. It's great to see that you've absorbed the key points and messages from each video. Understanding these concepts is essential for your successful journey with Edoofa.

03/11/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
03/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we are
03/11/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

03/11/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
03/11/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 10:45 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 355 9768: Okay thank you
03/11/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
03/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 355 9768: Okay sure l will
03/11/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
03/11/23, 11:00 am - +263 71 355 9768: Am at school at the moment ,so l guess by the end of today l will be done
03/11/23, 11:02 am - Milan Edoofa: That sounds good, Eve. Once you're back from school, you can begin the tasks, and by the end of the day, if you can complete them, that would be wonderful.

And then once it would be done from my side, we will then continue with our discussion here by tomorrow at 08.30 AM please. Until then, have a blessed day ahead.
03/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 355 9768: Okay , have a blessed day as well
04/11/23, 1:47 am - +263 71 355 9768: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 1:54 am - +263 71 355 9768: <Media omitted>

06/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 355 9768: 2.It is true that society is a social construction, and its existence is dependent on the beliefs and behaviors of individuals.However, this does not mean that it is merely a figment of our imagination. Rather, it is a system of norms, values, and institutions that influence and constrain individual action.For example, the laws and rules of society are a real constraint on individual behavior, even if they are socially constructed. In addition, the norms of society shape individual behavior by setting expectations and providing a framework for how individuals should behave.
06/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 355 9768: 3.The relationship between sociology and economics is a complex one, but the two fields often overlap and complement each other. Sociology is the study of human society and social relationships, while economics is the study of how resources are produced, distributed, and consumed. The two disciplines share many topics of interest, such as inequality, class, work, consumption, and globalization.  In addition, many economic theories, such as the concept of rational choice, have been heavily influenced by sociology. Similarly, many sociological theories, such as the concept of social capital, have roots in economics.
06/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 355 9768: 4.Institutional theory suggests that institutions serve both positive and negative functions in society . On the positive side, institutions can provide stability and predictability, promote cooperation and social cohesion, and facilitate economic growth and development.For example, the rule of law provides a predictable legal framework that protects property rights and allows for the enforcement of contracts.This fosters trust and encourages investment, which in turn leads to economic growth.On the negative side, institutions can also be used to maintain power and privilege, and to oppress and exploit certain groups.
06/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 355 9768: For example, the institution of slavery was used to enforce the dominance of white slave owners over African slaves.This institution was designed to maintain power and privilege for the slave owners, and to exploit the labor and bodies of the slaves.Similarly, the institution of colonialism was used by European powers to extract resources and wealth from colonized countries, often at the expense of the local populations.In this way, institutions can be used to perpetuate inequality and injustice.
06/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 355 9768: 5.In sociology, primary groups are small, face-to-face groups that are characterized by intimate, long-term relationships.Examples of primary groups include families, friends, and neighbors. Whereas Secondary groups are larger, more impersonal groups that are based on a specific purpose or interest.Examples of secondary groups include organizations, work groups, and clubs. 
Furthermore , In-groups are primary or secondary groups to which a person belongs and feels a sense of belonging.whereas out-groups are groups to which a person does not belong and may even feel a sense of hostility or opposition towards.
06/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Sorry for the late reply , we are having problems with with electricity ,so my phone had no power
06/11/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eve!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/11/23, 3:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your documents with me here, they are well noted please. Moving ahead, I would also like to mention that you were to share your A-Level supporting document as well, but you have not share the same with me till now. On that note, can you please let me know by when would you be able to share the same with me here so that we can proceed with our discussion here?
06/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Iam at school at the moment ,l will send it as soon as l get home
06/11/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. On that note, if I may ask, by when would you be able to share them with me here please?
06/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 355 9768: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 355 9768: I have got access to tell someone from home to send it
06/11/23, 6:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process.
06/11/23, 6:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay
06/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes it is indeed accurate
06/11/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
06/11/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
06/11/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
06/11/23, 7:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
06/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes l agree
06/11/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
06/11/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
06/11/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
06/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay this is understood
06/11/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
06/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Correct
06/11/23, 8:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
06/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we are
06/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes l have
06/11/23, 9:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
06/11/23, 9:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
06/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay this is as well understood
06/11/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/11/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/11/23, 9:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay  understood as well
06/11/23, 9:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 10:01 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay let's say l don't receive an acceptance letter from any University. What will you then do ?
06/11/23, 10:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a valid concern. At Edoofa, we partner with multiple universities in India, and our team works diligently to present your application to these institutions.

Moving ahead, a situation in which you won't receive an offer letter can only arrive when you won't be eligible for pursuing the selected course. I hope this is clear?
06/11/23, 10:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your end since I haven't received it yet, and as it's getting late on our end, I was considering concluding our conversation for today. 

I kindly suggest that we reconnect here tomorrow at our scheduled time of 01:00 PM CAT to continue our discussion and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Wishing you a peaceful evening until then!
06/11/23, 11:03 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes its clear
06/11/23, 11:04 pm - +263 78 659 9881: This message was deleted
06/11/23, 11:05 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay thank you , wish you a peaceful night as well
07/11/23, 1:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Eve!
I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits.

As the time for our scheduled session has arrived, I would like to confirm your readiness to proceed with our discussion. This will allow us to move forward seamlessly with the next steps in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready to begin with our discussion here?
07/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we are ready
07/11/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for confirming your readiness. Moving ahead, if I may ask, are you clear till here please?
07/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes lam
07/11/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
07/11/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
07/11/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
07/11/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we are very much excited
07/11/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience. <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

07/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Thank you very much
07/11/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
07/11/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
07/11/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

07/11/23, 3:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
07/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes l have reviewed the benefits
07/11/23, 5:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
07/11/23, 5:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 5:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
07/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay this is well understood
07/11/23, 5:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead to the second Benefit.
07/11/23, 5:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
07/11/23, 5:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
07/11/23, 5:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes it does
07/11/23, 6:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead to the third benefit.
07/11/23, 6:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
07/11/23, 6:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
07/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes it does
07/11/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
07/11/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
07/11/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
07/11/23, 8:50 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes l have followed the details
07/11/23, 8:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 71 355 9768: No l don't have anything to inquire
07/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 355 9768: I would like you to provide the  information
07/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 8:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/11/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
07/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay that's clear ,thank you
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes
07/11/23, 9:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes,but now l would like to know what if l choose the 3rd option will l get my parent's money back
07/11/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, let me help you in understanding all three options here starting with the first one. 

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/11/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes that's clear
07/11/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Coming to the second option here. 

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/11/23, 9:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes lam
07/11/23, 9:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/11/23, 10:06 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Oh okay l get it now
07/11/23, 10:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 10:48 pm - +263 71 355 9768: no all is clear thank you
07/11/23, 10:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 42 students have already secured their seats, leaving 58 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/11/23, 10:50 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes am very anxious  about all these
07/11/23, 10:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Your enthusiasm is truly appreciated, and I share your excitement. We believe in your potential and are confident that you will make the most of this wonderful opportunity. Rest assured, the journey ahead will be rewarding and transformative.
07/11/23, 10:53 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Thank you and l truly trust and believe you
07/11/23, 10:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please! We will now move ahead to process Eve's university application and will share the updates with you here moving ahead. For now, we can conclude our discussion here. Wishing you a blessed night!
07/11/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Wish you a blessed night as well
16/11/23, 10:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Eve!
I hope this message finds you well.

As we discussed earlier, your EWYL Program was initially scheduled to commence on November 7th, 2023. However, last week marked the Diwali festival here in India, and our team was observing this significant celebration, resulting in a pause in our operations.

Considering this, I'd like to inform you that your EWYL Program is rescheduled to start on November 21st, 2023. Therefore, I kindly request you to re-submit your EWYL Form with the updated date mentioned and share it with me here. However, since it is already too late on my end, I would request you to work on your EWYL Form again and share it with me by tomorrow at 01.00 PM so that I can relay the same information ahead to the EWYL Team and get your EWYL Program started. Until then, wishing you a blessed night!
17/11/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eve!
I hope you are doing well today.

As per the update that I had shared with you here last night, if I may ask, were you able to correct the EWYL Form by now so that we can move aehad to start with your EWYL Program?
17/11/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 355 9768: My absolute apology , l had an exam today in which l needed to attend to ,when l came back l figured out that there was no electricity so l couldn't print it but definitely tomorrow morning l will do so and resend it to you
17/11/23, 10:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. How was your exam?
17/11/23, 10:24 pm - +263 71 355 9768: It was fair and fine not sure as to how your day was?
17/11/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: My day was very well, thank you for asking dear. Now, after such a lengthy day, I believe you must be in need for proper rest, right?
17/11/23, 11:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Eve, since I am wrapping up for the day, hence, while doing so, I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/11/23, 11:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 08:30 AM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐ <This message was edited>

18/11/23, 8:31 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Eve!
I hope you are doing well today and had a great evening yesterday.

Moving ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter that I had shared with you here earlier and if you are available to discuss the same now?
18/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we went through the offer letter
18/11/23, 8:33 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 8:33 am - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 71 355 9768: Yes it does work
18/11/23, 8:37 am - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 8:37 am - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 355 9768: Yes am set
18/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 355 9768: 1.   $900 USD
2.   3 years 
3.   $300 USD 
4.   $750 USD
18/11/23, 8:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 355 9768: Yes
18/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 355 9768: Sorry for the late replies , network is tripping here
18/11/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 10:17 am - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 71 355 9768: Ohhh okay ,that is well understood
18/11/23, 12:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes it does
20/11/23, 8:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Eve!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 355 9768: Yes its fine ,no issues
20/11/23, 9:43 am - +263 71 355 9768: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eve!

I am glad to reconnect with you here. Now, as we're about to reconvene our discussion shortly, I trust you're ready to continue with our conversation as per the schedule?
20/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we ready
20/11/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. How was your weekend?
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 355 9768: It was fine ,l can't complain not sure about yours
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mine was good as well dear, thank you for asking. Now, let us move ahead with our discussion here. But before we do that, may I know if you are clear till here please?
20/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes all clear
20/11/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes clear
21/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Good afternoon to you all ,hope you doing fine
21/11/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Eve!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we can continue
21/11/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/11/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
21/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 355 9768: This is great news
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we are
21/11/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes l would like that
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes we are in agreement
21/11/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes l reside in Harare
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 2:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Okay thank you
21/11/23, 2:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles' FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes sure
21/11/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo

21/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Thank you very much
21/11/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Ohhh okay
21/11/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/11/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/11/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?

It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes l have
21/11/23, 5:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 355 9768: Yes it does
21/11/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/11/23, 5:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 355 9768: No l don't have any queries
