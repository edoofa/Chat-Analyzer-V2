As agreed, our session is scheduled to commence now, aimed at initiating your admission journey and progressing further. Are you available to start our discussion?
02/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 472 4997: good evening to you too sir
02/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 472 4997: You can carry on
02/11/23, 6:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know Mrs. Rutendo! How was your day?
02/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 962 4966: good evening sir
02/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 962 4966: you can go on
02/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 472 4997: My day was pretty good and how was yours over there.
02/11/23, 6:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: It's been a productive day. Thank you for asking, Mrs. Rutendo. Now, as you've mentioned, the forms are in the process of being completed and the completed ones are to be submitted. I'll check on that. Please allow me a moment.
02/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 962 4966: it’s ok
02/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Glory be to God. It is well.
02/11/23, 7:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your patience here. Now, I have gone through the EWYL Document that you have filled in here and I have noticed that you have written EWYL Program Availability as August 2024, if I may ask why is that?
02/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Because Joy is completing her A Level  this year in November .I don't if it's possible for her to start this year if I my ask.
02/11/23, 7:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand, Mrs. Rutendo. Completing the A Levels is indeed important. Concerning starting the EWYL Program in 2024, it is possible to commence it earlier if Joy is open and ready to begin. The availability mentioned in the document is aimed at ensuring the student is prepared for the program. Now, as I had mentioned earlier as well that the next batch of EWYL Program is planned to begin on 07th November please. On that note, you can fill in that date for staring with Joy's EWYL Program as well, I hope this is understood?
02/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I think i need to be assisted on this issue sir Joy's last examination paper is on 15 November so I need your advice on this issue
02/11/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I can understand that Joy is currently in her exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect her exams, which already began. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, she can enhance her study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit her performance in the upcoming exams.
02/11/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between the EWYL program commitments and her exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
02/11/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if she is occupied with exams, you as parents on her behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 07th of November, and the next date will be followed as the orientation date, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
02/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Understand
02/11/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand, Mrs. Rutendo. We always aim to be flexible and supportive of the students' academic commitments. It's great to have you on board for the EWYL program, and we'll make sure you have all the necessary resources and information for a successful start.

Moving ahead, can you please let me know by when would you be able to share the corrected form with me here please?
02/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 472 4997: So I'm going to change the dates  to November 2023 I stand to be corrected  sir
02/11/23, 7:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for considering the adjustment, Mrs. Rutendo. Changing the dates to 07th November 2023 would be aligned with our planned schedule for the EWYL program. If you can revise the document accordingly and submit it here, that would be great. I hope this is clear?
02/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Completely clear
02/11/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, if I may ask by when would you be able to share the corrected form with me here please?
02/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Tomorrow my be same time that I send today
02/11/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. I would wait for you to share the same with me at that time, moving ahead, shall we proceed with our discussion here now?
02/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 472 4997: With pleasure
02/11/23, 7:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Ready to hear from you sir
02/11/23, 8:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 8:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
02/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I'm through Mr sir
02/11/23, 8:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 8:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Clear
02/11/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 472 4997: In the same track
02/11/23, 8:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 8:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Noted
02/11/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
02/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Is there any payment plan on Admission fee  or else ?
02/11/23, 8:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, indeed, there would be a payment plan available for the admission fee and we will be discussing that moving ahead during our discussion. For now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask pertaining to the admission process?
02/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Know query
02/11/23, 8:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 472 4997: You can carry on

04/11/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: 1.

05/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 962 4966: 2.Our environment means our physical surrounding and the characteristics of the place in which we live .Furthermore, human beings have been interacting with their environment since people first walked the earth .In addition  a good climate where there is clean water,fertile soil etc ,enables us to live and thrive , however harsh conditions like hot climates , environmental disasters ( earthquakes,floods,droughts etc) and limited water makes 
human life hard .The impact of human activity were not very significant because the technologies used were not capable of modifying the environment on a large scale.People at that time used simple tools with limited environmental impact.Our relationship with the environment changes due to the industrialization in the 18th centuries which introduced the use of machines ,example  for now we are using powerful chainsaws to cutdown trees and industrially produced chemical fertilizer and pesticides for crop production which fosters exploitation of resources .Moreover,these changes have rapidly increased the human impact on the environment.
05/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 962 4966: 4.In Geography places can be connected through transportation networks,communication,cultural interactions, trade and economic ties and environmental factors . 
Transportation networks : Places can be connected through roads,railways,airports and ports.In addition, these  networks enable the movement of goods ,ideas and people between locations.
Communication:Communication systems such as internet,telephone lines and satellite communication connects places .In addition information can be exchanged via video calls,emails and more social media platforms.
Trade and Economic ties:Trade and economic activities connects places through the exchange of goods and services,development of economic interdependence ,for example Zimbabwe exports Agriculture products whilst importing manufactured goods. 
Cultural interactions:Migration,tourism and cultural exchange connects places.People move from one place to another ,they bring in  their traditions and cultures.This lead to blending of different cultures and exchange of ideas 
Environmental factors:Places can be connected through rivers,mountains and climate patterns.Furthermore, this shape the interaction between places
05/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 962 4966: 5.GIS(Geographic Information System):This is a computer system for capturing,storing,checking and displaying data related to positions on Earth surface.
GIS uses information that includes location,expressed in many ways such as longitude,latitude,address or Zip code.Information can be assessed using GIS.Moreover, it includes data about people such as population,income and educational level .The Geographical Information System includes information like landscape,location of streams,schools ,vegetation,roads,farms,factories,storm drains ,electric power lines and different kind of soils  etc .In addition the system enable different kind of information on a certain map .GIS  uses data that is attached to unique.The system enables people to compare locations in order to discover how they relate to each other.Furthermore,it provides information in both hardware and software form .Also the data can be cartographs or surveys.Remote sensing provides tools that can be integrated  into  a GIS.However it is expensive and complex to use GIS ,also it requires certain skills .
05/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 962 4966: 1.Zimbabwe is a developing country.With the carriers I want to built I will develop my country by fostering:

06/11/23, 10:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your end since I haven't received it yet, and as it's getting late on our end, I was considering concluding our conversation for today. 

I kindly suggest that we reconnect here tomorrow at our scheduled time of 01:00 PM CAT to continue our discussion and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Wishing you a peaceful evening until then!
07/11/23, 6:03 am - +263 77 472 4997: Morning morning I'm very sorry for that JOY is at school and she is the one who has her O Level result same time network is a great challenge at her school
07/11/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Joy!
I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits.

Now, thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, I would like to ask that if you were able to arrange the O-Level Results from Joy yet so that we can proceed?
07/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Note yet I am trying to call the school  head of her school where the results are but unfortunately his phone is not reachable but I hope that by the end of the day we shall have a better answer
07/11/23, 2:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, shall we now move ahead with our discussion here and then once you will receive the results, you can share them here. I hope this is understood?
07/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes I do understand
07/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 472 4997: We can proceed
07/11/23, 3:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Geography) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
07/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes
07/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
07/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
07/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
07/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
07/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Ye I do
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
07/11/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
07/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I'm completely aware
07/11/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
07/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes we are
07/11/23, 6:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
07/11/23, 10:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Since I haven't received a response yet, and considering the time, I believe it's best to conclude our conversation for today.

I propose that we reconnect tomorrow at our scheduled time of 01:00 PM CAT to continue our discussion and progress further in your admission journey. I wish you a peaceful evening until then
08/11/23, 5:59 am - +263 78 962 4966: Yes i understand
08/11/23, 1:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Joy!
I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits.

As the time for our scheduled session has arrived, I would like to confirm your readiness to proceed with our discussion. This will allow us to move forward seamlessly with the next steps in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready to begin with our discussion here?
08/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Good afternoon sir we are ready
08/11/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Before we move ahead, can you please let me know if you are clear till here?
08/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I'm at work so I will just adjust a little bit so that I can attend to you
08/11/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. However, I am not clear whether you wish to move ahead now, or later?
08/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Lets move
08/11/23, 3:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, before we move ahead, can you please let me know of this as well?
08/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I'm oky with that
08/11/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
08/11/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
08/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 472 4997: well noted
08/11/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
08/11/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
08/11/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
08/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 472 4997: oky
08/11/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the hour is getting late on my end, I'm regrettably reaching the end of my available time for today.

Hence, let's reconnect tomorrow from 09:30 AM onwards to continue our conversation. Wishing you a restful and pleasant evening, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family as well.
09/11/23, 8:27 am - +263 77 472 4997: Morning noted
09/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Dear Parents and Joy!

This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education? <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 472 4997: No questions
09/11/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, I understand.

You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/11/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
09/11/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in. <This message was edited>

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/11/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 472 4997: Together we conquer
09/11/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
09/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 472 4997: Wauul wonderful I really appreciate that
09/11/23, 10:46 am - Milan Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/11/23, 10:46 am - Milan Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/11/23, 10:47 am - Milan Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
09/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 962 4966: Morning Sir
09/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 962 4966: I have go through the benefits they are too good . You can go ahead
09/11/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/11/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
09/11/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
09/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 472 4997: Done
09/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 472 4997: Wonderful
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes it's does
09/11/23, 12:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/11/23, 12:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Indeed
09/11/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/11/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/11/23, 12:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Noo
09/11/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I need more information on it
09/11/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/11/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/11/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/11/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes
09/11/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
09/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Nooo
09/11/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 472 4997: Yes I do
14/11/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Happy Happy thank you
14/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Long time
14/11/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes please. Kindly excuse us for the same since the team wasn't available due to the festive occasion of Diwali, which was a time for everyone to celebrate and enjoy the holiday. But now that we're back, let's continue where we left off. If you're ready, we can dive back into continuing with our discussion. Shall we?
14/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes
14/11/23, 2:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please let me know if you are clear till here as well so that we can proceed?
14/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes you can proceed
14/11/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/11/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes I do understand
14/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
14/11/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Completely clear
14/11/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Noted
14/11/23, 4:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 472 4997: No queries
14/11/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Currently, 70 students have already secured their seats, leaving 30 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
14/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Much excited sir
14/11/23, 6:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Your enthusiasm is truly appreciated, and I share your excitement. We believe in your potential and are confident that you will make the most of this wonderful opportunity. Rest assured, the journey ahead will be rewarding and transformative.

We will now move ahead to process your university application and will share the updates with you here moving ahead. For now, we can conclude our discussion here. Wishing you a blessed night!
15/11/23, 8:09 am - +263 77 472 4997: Thank you hope you also have a blessed night.Good morning
16/11/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Joy!
I hope this message finds you well.

Therefore, I kindly request you to re-submit your EWYL Form with the updated date mentioned and share it with me here.

Until then, wishing you a blessed night!
16/11/23, 10:50 pm - +263 78 962 4966: Evening , how are you Sir
16/11/23, 10:50 pm - +263 78 962 4966: Noted with thanks

17/11/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask why would it take you till Monday to do that dear?
17/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I'm going to my father's home which is in rural area where they is no network
17/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I am  on my way right now
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear. Once you are done with that, please let me know.
21/11/23, 9:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents Joy!

28/11/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Joy,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Can you explain further the nonrefundable issue  and what original documents needed
28/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: yes, please. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 472 4997: OK Thank you
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 472 4997: 1)$1165
2)3
3)$2415
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please check and respond to the 3rd question again?
28/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 472 4997: 3)$750
28/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1165, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2415. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
28/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes
28/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
28/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
28/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
28/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2165 ($1165 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
28/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes
28/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
28/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 472 4997: OK sir
28/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established Name’s total annual education cost as $2165, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
28/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
28/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Well noted
28/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Joy with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
28/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2165. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2165 - $1000 = $1165, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
28/11/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
28/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 472 4997: I can see
28/11/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
28/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1165 - $750 = $415, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
28/11/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1165 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665. This amount can be paid in two installments of $832 and $833, spaced 6 months apart.
28/11/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
28/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Noted
28/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as december 11, 2023.

In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
28/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes I do
28/11/23, 9:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Yemurai's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Sure
28/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/11/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 472 4997: I reside in Chegutu a small town in Mashonaland Province which is about 108 km from our capital city 
That is Harare
29/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Joy.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that, I have taken note of the same, and we will be connecting today again in the evening at 06:00 pm for our discussion, I hope you will be available.
29/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we can connect now to continue with our discussion?
29/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Good evening how are you
29/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
29/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes I am
29/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Oky thank you so much
29/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
29/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
29/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 472 4997: It's oky
29/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
29/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Thank you
29/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

29/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.

30/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Joy!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by PDM University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from PDM University as a collective?
30/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Good afternoon how are you
30/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes I am
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from PDM University as a collective?
30/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Yes we have  discussed the issue
30/11/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Very excited and busy working on fees targeted before deadline
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 472 4997: On the offer letter it is written that In case of non_confirmation if admission due to deficiency of original and valid documents forfeiture..... can you please explain further on this
30/11/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, allow me to clarify this statement further. The statement you've come across is indeed accurate, but it typically applies to students who pursue regular admissions without the support of Edoofa. Your situation is unique because you are enrolled through Edoofa. We have taken proactive steps to ensure that all of Joy's documents are properly prepared and in order before submitting the application to the university on your behalf. Therefore, there's no need for you to be concerned about it. It's important to note that the format of the letter is standardized for all students, which is why you have come across this statement.
30/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Thank you for clarification on this
30/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
30/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 472 4997: Still in process of researching on that
30/11/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
30/11/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
30/11/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
