17/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 318 3119: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and thank you for sharing the academic documents, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Sure you can
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Master of Computer Applications (MCA) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?

17/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, could you also please share the following documents.

1. Bachelor's degree.

2. Bachelor's transcript.
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 318 3119: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the Bachelor's transcript, may I know by when will you be able to share the degree also?
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 318 3119: What do you really need for the degree
17/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 318 3119: So I should write an application letter
17/10/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263783183119 No please, once you finished your Bachelor's, the university must have issued you a bachelor's degree along with the transcripts, that is what I am asking you to share, please.
17/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 318 3119: I'm in my fourth year right now
17/10/23, 4:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, right now you are in your 8th semester, right @263783183119?
17/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Yes I'm I'm in 4:1
17/10/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the information. To clarify, could you please specify the exact start date for your 4th-year 2nd-semester studies?
17/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 318 3119: February 2024
17/10/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 318 3119: We ended on stage 3
17/10/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct, may I know if you recall the registration process and the registration fee of $500-$750 as well?
17/10/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Registration fee due is $750, I will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve my  scholarship seat, and when I make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards my first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee I will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months.
17/10/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
17/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 318 3119: I don't have any question
17/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
17/10/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Thank you I'm looking forward to
17/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Afternoon
18/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Received
18/10/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moses.

I hope you are doing well, since we were not able to connect yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
18/10/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 8:04 am - +263 78 318 3119: Good morning
19/10/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moses.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress?
19/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 318 3119: We can continue
19/10/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you were able to go through the benefits above?
19/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Yes I did
19/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results bachelors transcripts, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Moses, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Noted thank you
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Clear enough thank you
19/10/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Noted thank you
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 318 3119: So far everything is clear
19/10/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 318 3119: $600 for admission and this will be adjusted against my first year university fee of $2000-$3000
19/10/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. This $600 you can pay in two installments as well, and the remaining $150 Edoofa will cover for you hence a total of $750 would be adjusted to your annual fee of $2000-$3000.

I hope you are clear?
19/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Clear enough thank you
19/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 318 3119: I can't wait
19/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Same to you thank you
17/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Moses,

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/11/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
17/11/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 318 3119: I did thank you for asking
18/11/23, 6:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 6:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Sure, you can continue
18/11/23, 6:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 6:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 318 3119: 1. $900
2.$1800
3.$300
4. $750
18/11/23, 6:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the response here dear, however in question number 2, you have to mention your course duration, so, can you please let me know of that as well by taking at the offer letter again?
18/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 318 3119: 2. Master in Computer Applications 
Time: 2 years Total fee $3600
18/11/23, 6:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a two-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 4 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Clear enough
18/11/23, 6:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 6:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 6:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 318 3119: I think I will go for Independent accomodation
18/11/23, 7:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed, you can choose on the basis of your preference. Moving ahead, I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Can u clarify the transportation
18/11/23, 7:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, what do you wish to know more about transportation? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 318 3119: does the university provide transport?
18/11/23, 7:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that all the accommodation options are situated at a walking distance from the university campus therefore, there is no need for the transport. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Okay thank you
18/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 318 3119: I would like to know the issue about the pending results and due dates
18/11/23, 7:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. What do you wish to know more about that please?
18/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 318 3119: can i know the registration due date to submit my full transcript
18/11/23, 7:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. Now, when it comes to the statement that you are referring to, means that once you will arrive here in India, you would have to submit your results before registering yourself here. I hope this is clear?
18/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 318 3119: I'm finishing my bachelor's degree in August 2024  so can you tell me my arriving month to  India
18/11/23, 8:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, you would be arriving here in the month of August-September 2024, since that is the same month when your course will be starting please. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Clear enough thank
18/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 318 3119: You
18/11/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Clear you can  continue
18/11/23, 8:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 8:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Understood
18/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 318 3119: When is this $300 supposed to be paid
18/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 318 3119: What is  the payment plan here
18/11/23, 8:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Sure
18/11/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Clear enough thank you
18/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 318 3119: This $300 is paid when
18/11/23, 9:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: As I have mentioned here, the deadlines for making the payment in parts are the ones mentioned here. I hope you are now clear about that?
18/11/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Parents and Moses, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.
20/11/23, 8:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moses!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 8:14 am - +263 78 318 3119: Noted the time is good
20/11/23, 8:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. I'm glad 1 PM works for you. I look forward to our continued discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University at the scheduled time now.

20/11/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear. Thank you for asking that question, now let m e help you in understanding about the same here. As you can see that it is written that the $300 Admission Processing Fee has been waived off under the Early Registration Scheme. This means that you do not have to pay that amount at all. I hope this is understood?
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 318 3119: understood thank you
20/11/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 575 5629: Moses is currently staying in gweru town but during vacation will be in masvingo town
20/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 575 5629: May you let us know about the harare alternative
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moses!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
22/11/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moses!
I hope you are doing well today.

I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter here. May I know by when can we connect with each other here again for the same?
23/11/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Moses!

24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Since tomorrow is our off day and the team won't be available, that is why I was suggesting that we have this discussion here today. May I know if you would be able to connect with me here for a session by 09.30 PM today?
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Sure we can discuss from 6
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Once you are available, please let me know.

24/11/23, 7:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
24/11/23, 7:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
24/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 318 3119: 1. $900
2.$1800
3.$300
4. $750
24/11/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response on that. However, when it comes to question number, second, I believe you have not answered it correctly, hence, may you please take a look at the letter again and let me know of the correct answer.
24/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 318 3119: may I know about the payment process
24/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 318 3119: in Zimbabwe
24/11/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Stay assured that we will discuss about every aspect of the offer letter moving ahead, including the payment process, deadlines, fee structure etc. However, since it is meant to be done step by step to give you better clarity, shall we do it that way?
24/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 78 318 3119: sure
24/11/23, 7:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are ready to cooperate. Now, moving ahead, may you please do this as well.
24/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Sure
24/11/23, 8:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through the offer letter again to correct the second answer?
24/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Yes it's $3600
24/11/23, 8:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263783183119 I believe you are having some confusion here. Let me help you in clearing that up. Question two here asks about the duration of your course, i.e. 2 years. Now, As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a two-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 4 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
24/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 802 1283: Ok.Thank You
24/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
24/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
24/11/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
24/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 71 802 1283: Ok
I opt for off campus
24/11/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
24/11/23, 11:08 pm - +263 77 230 3068: True
25/11/23, 8:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Moses!
I hope you are doing well today.
25/11/23, 8:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
25/11/23, 8:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, I am glad to hear that you are clear till here please. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
25/11/23, 8:22 am - +263 78 318 3119: you can move on
25/11/23, 8:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
25/11/23, 8:23 am - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
25/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 318 3119: sure
25/11/23, 8:34 am - Milan Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
25/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 318 3119: understood
25/11/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 318 3119: you can explain
25/11/23, 8:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
25/11/23, 8:39 am - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
25/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 318 3119: understood
25/11/23, 8:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
25/11/23, 8:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
25/11/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 318 3119: yes i stay in Harare
25/11/23, 8:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
25/11/23, 8:51 am - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
25/11/23, 8:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
25/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 318 3119: okay thank
25/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 318 3119: what is needed in terms of paperwork process
25/11/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, which Paperwork Process are you referring to here?
25/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 78 318 3119: I'm only supposed to give Mr  Rajan the $321 ...?
25/11/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
25/11/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
25/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 230 3068: Yes
25/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 318 3119: Can I have the account number for Mr Charles
25/11/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
25/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 230 3068: Thank you
25/11/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
25/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 230 3068: Thank you
25/11/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
25/11/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
25/11/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
25/11/23, 10:57 am - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
25/11/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 230 3068: Thank you
25/11/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
25/11/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
25/11/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
25/11/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 318 3119: Understood
25/11/23, 12:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
25/11/23, 12:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
25/11/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263783183119 @263772303068 May I know if we are still connected with each other here please?
25/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 230 3068: Yes
