09/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Name of Student: Makanakaishe Mutasa
University Name: MVN University

Registration Fee Due: $1000
Endowment Grant: $150
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $1000 - $150 = $850

Payment Mode Used: Mr. Charles 
International Transfer Charges: $106 (12.5% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $850 + $106 = $956

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $481 (Paid on 25 November 2023)

Balance Amount Due: $956 - $481 = $475

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $475 is to be paid on or before the due date of 30th December 2023. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process.
09/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok noted.
09/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 368 2925: But I thought also that as a University, it was going to send a proof of payment in a Pdf form maybe with it's Logo for us to see.  Thus my question.
