25/10/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. So may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
25/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 552 0120: Yes i did listen to the audios
25/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos/ audios.
25/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 552 0120: The emphasis on the Videos is that   students who would excell in their education in India are those who follow instructions,are disciplined and open minded in their approach to school moreso since Edoofa programs offer business opportunities to students.The role of Edoofa is to make education affordable.Higher education is comprised of a system that is integrated hence the need for students to follow the necessary protocols in order to succeed in their schooling.
Its not all the schools and Universities that are good.Good  schools are those that make students pass with flying colours because they have good infrastructure,qualified teachers,are accredited,There are some schools that just make education a business and negate the need to produce quality results.
Statement of purpose is very key in determining the kind of a student one is as it outlines the strengths of the student,the vision that the student has with regard to where they want to achieve through their education,it also outlines why a student chooses a particular course,the kind of activities the sfudent was involved in previuosly as this should be married with the path that one wants to take.The statement of purpose should be able to convince any school of one's  suitability,it is a marketing tool for any student.The student's documents should present a unique selling proposition
25/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
25/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
25/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
25/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
25/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 552 0120: Noted
25/10/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
25/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 552 0120: Yes i am following
25/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of Victor's university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in victor's admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
25/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move Victor's application ahead and help him write a proper statement of purpose so that he can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on his application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, we would require his availability for approximately 30 minutes. If he is unavailable, he can provide you with his input, and you can proceed with the statement of purpose on his behalf.
25/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in victor's admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

26/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Question 4 what is Heat treatment and why it is done: Heat treatment is a process that involves the controlled heating and cooling of materials to alter their physical and mechanical properties. 

Heat treatments is done so as to :

1 .Improving Mechanical Properties:
One of the primary reasons for conducting heat treatment is to enhance the mechanical properties of materials. By subjecting a material to specific heating and cooling cycles, its hardness, strength, toughness, and ductility can be improved. Heat treatment can modify the microstructure of materials, such as metals and alloys, by changing the arrangement of atoms or the formation of new phases.

2. Increasing Wear Resistance:
Heat treatment can significantly increase the wear resistance of materials. By subjecting a material to processes like carburizing or nitriding, a hard surface layer with high wear resistance can be formed. Carburizing involves introducing carbon into the surface layer of a low-carbon steel by heating it in a carbon-rich environment.

3. Enhancing Machinability:
Certain materials, such as stainless steels and high-alloy steels, are known for their poor machinability due to their hardness and toughness. Heat treatment techniques like annealing or stress relieving can improve machinability by softening these materials. Annealing involves heating the material to a specific temperature and then slowly cooling it to relieve internal stresses and make it more workable.
26/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Question 5 what are compressors ? What are the different types and what types are used in a gas Turbine and why ?:

 A compressor is a device that is used to reduce the volume of air or gas by increasing its pressure. It works by forcing the air or gas through a small opening, which causes the pressure to increase and the volume to decrease. This process is known as compression.

There are several types of compressors, including:

1. Centrifugal compressors: These use a spinning impeller to increase the velocity of the gas or air, which causes the pressure to increase. They are commonly used in gas turbines because they can handle large volumes of air and are efficient at high speeds.
2. Axial compressors: These use a series of rotating blades to compress the gas or air. They are commonly used in high-speed applications, such as jet engines.
3. Reciprocating compressors: These use a piston and cylinder to compress the gas or air. They are commonly used in low- to medium-pressure applications, such as air conditioning and refrigeration systems.

In a gas turbine, centrifugal compressors are typically used because they can handle the high temperatures and pressures generated by the combustion of fuel and air. The compressor draws in air and compresses it before delivering it to the combustion chamber, where it is mixed with fuel and ignited, producing power.
26/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Question 2 Elaborate about the law of Thermodynamics with examples:  The Law of Thermodynamics

The law of thermodynamics is a fundamental principle that governs the behavior of energy and its interactions with matter. There are four laws of thermodynamics, each of which describes a different aspect of energy and its behavior.

First Law of Thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This means that the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant, but the form of the energy can change. For example, when you burn gasoline in a car engine, the chemical energy of the gasoline is converted into kinetic energy of the car, and the total amount of energy remains the same.

Second Law of Thermodynamics

The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system always increases over time. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system, and the second law states that the universe as a whole is becoming more disordered and random over time. For example, when you mix hot and cold water together, the total entropy of the system increases because the hot water loses its ordered structure and becomes mixed with the cold water. 

Examples of the Law of Thermodynamics

1. A car engine converts the chemical energy of gasoline into kinetic energy of the car. This is an example of the first law of thermodynamics, because the total amount of energy remains the same, but the form of the energy is converted.
2. Mixing hot and cold water together is an example of the second law of thermodynamics, because the total entropy of the system increases as the hot water loses its ordered structure and becomes mixed with the cold water.
26/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions, may I know by when will you be able to share question 3 as well?
26/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Question 3  what is  a valve? What is the function of a butterfly valve and where it is used? : 
A valve is  a mechanical device that controls the flow of fluids , by opening  closing,or partially obstructing various passageways . It is an essential component in many systems and industries including  gas and oil industries, power generation, chemical processing.

Butterfly valves are a type of  a valve that use a disc shaped closure element to regulate the flow of fluid through a pipe or tube. The disc is mounted on a rod passing through the center and can be rotated in to control the flow . When the valve is fully open, the disc is positioned parallel to the flow direction, allowing for unrestricted passage of fluid. When the valve is closed, the disc is turned perpendicular to the flow , direction, blocking off the passage completely 

The function of a butterfly valve is to control and regulate fluid flow it can be used to start stop ,or throttle the  flow of fluid in  a pipe line. Butterfly valves are particularly suitable for large scale systems where high flow rate is required.Butterfly valves are also used in heating , ventilation, and air conditioning systems. These systems often incorporate butterfly valves for controlling the flow of air or water with in the system They are also used in aerospace , for their quick operation and  low pressure drop . 
 Butterfly valves are used on all types of ships and firefighting apparatus. They are also widely used for domestic piping purposes. On ships they are used for large capacity lines such as forward and aft sea water suction lines or lines from various tanks to their respective pumps.
26/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the questions, may I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents?

26/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your academic documents, may I know by when will you be able to share your statement of entry for A- level
26/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 814 3739: I only wrote the O level exam then i came straight to Bulawayo polytechnic i did not sit for the A level exam
26/10/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
26/10/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Diploma (Mechanical Engineering) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
26/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 814 3739: I want to pursue a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering as I wrote the O level examination
26/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes, iam very much ready .
26/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
26/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes, it is not possible to study at multiple universities at the same time.
26/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
26/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
26/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes we discussed about the registration fee with my counselor
26/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
26/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes we are  , iam following .
26/10/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
26/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes i have
26/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
26/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
26/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay madam that’s is very much clear
26/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes very much clear mam . So the EWYL earnings will only be paying my university fees only .
26/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can use them once you register yourself with the university.
26/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 814 3739: No i have no questions right now,  lam following .
26/10/23, 10:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. to continue with our discussion as our available hours for today are almost over now.
26/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Ok mam thank you very much , have a blessed night.
27/10/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Victor.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Good afternoon ,Yes mam now iam available. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied in a meeting, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes, iam available now mam.
27/10/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam i am really waiting to get my offer letter so that i can also secure my scholarship seat.
27/10/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that Victor. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
27/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes, mam
27/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes ,i went through the benefits of Endowment program .
27/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes, we may proceed
27/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
27/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Victor, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay mam i am following I went through the first benefit
27/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes ,it does mam .
27/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam I am following  and i have gone through   , we are on the same page I understood everything.
27/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes ,mam i have followed and i have understood quite well.
27/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/10/23, 10:29 pm - +263 78 814 3739: I think all is well i have no queries for now mam .
27/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
27/10/23, 10:39 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes, mam iam very much excited for the next step and for my offer letter
27/10/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
27/10/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay ,mam thank you very much .
30/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Greetings

30/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263788143739 Since we are done with Step 4, now we await university's responses regarding your offer letter, please.
30/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay, thank you .
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya  and she has scheduled my session from 1:30pm to 2 :30pm Monday to Friday CAT.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Greetings ,Yes i went through the offer letter. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Thank you very much , indeed my family and i are very happy for this achievement of getting the offer letter.
15/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 5:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam noted , we may proceed.
15/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 78 814 3739: 1 .Tuition fee after scholarship :$900

2. The  standard Duration of my course : 3yrs ( 6 semesters )

3.Admission and procedure fee : $300

4.I need to pay the registration fee of $750 so that they can issue my admission Acceptance letter to apply for the student visa .
15/11/23, 6:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam ,indeed. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam noted , so the accommodation that costs around $800 where will i be staying.
15/11/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam .
15/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam, iam clear
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 814 3739: That is very good news mam , indeed this is great news as it will reduce the financial burden on my parents .
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam indeed i am following and we are together.
15/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam ,please explain .
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

Message after acknowledgment
15/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes , so  by  paying the first $300 registration fee  before the first deadline i will have occupied my scholarship seat  and pay the remaining $300 before yhe second deadline.
15/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 814 3739: I stay in Bulawayo city mam .
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay mam , we will connect with Mr.Rajan
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay, so paying through Mr. Rajan  , the transfer charge 7% of the total amount .
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct.
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay , noted
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Okay mam thank you , paying through  Mr charles will be okay . <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam thats very much okay  , noted
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes , I understood the same
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 814 3739: No , i  have no questions to ask you for now.
15/11/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes,  before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 18th of Novemeber. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
15/11/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Yes mam ,indeed this is great
15/11/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please have a great night ahead.

15/11/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 814 3739: That is very good mam, thank you very much .
15/11/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
18/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 814 3739: Greetings ,thank you same to you .
18/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Welcome.
20/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Victor!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 552 0120: Yes Madam we reviewed the offer letter,we are indeed verry grateful to the University for having accorded our son an opportunity to  study at such a prestigious institution
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 552 0120: We received the offer letter with much enthusiasm and we are determined as a family to put in place all the necessary resources in a bid to make sure that our son fully achieves his dream.
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 552 0120: So far we do not have any issues with the offer letter,we are seized with the issue of enrolment fees whose timelines we want to meet so that we do not blow away such a golden opportunity for our son
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 552 0120: We understand the first instalment of $300 i required on the 28th of November,then the balance of $300 by end of December 2023.
20/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 552 0120: *is required
20/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is excellent I can see you are through with our discussion. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 552 0120: The only request by our son is whether it is permissible for him to br placed at same University with his friend who is already studying in India
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, could you please help me with the name of his friend and the university he is currently studying in?
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 552 0120: Tinotenda Chari she is studying at Lovely Proffessional University
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 552 0120: She is doing Geology
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 552 0120: Its quite clear and noted with thanks
20/11/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let me help you understand even better. At the same time, since Lovely Professional University is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 552 0120: We are not aware of the transfer option
20/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 552 0120: That being the case we can continue with the current University that has accepted him,that is Galgotias
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias  without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Glagotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 552 0120: Its quite clear Madam
20/11/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that your query has been answered well. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
20/11/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

20/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this.

Hence, could you share these with me?
