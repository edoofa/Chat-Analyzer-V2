Along with Mr. Milan (Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Senior Admission Officer), Mr. Jyotishman (Head of Admission), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa, I will be handling the next steps in your university admission journey and will be directing you in the right direction so that you can reap the most benefits from the Edoofa scholarship program.

Before we proceed, I would like to check in with you and your family. How are you all doing today?

31/07/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I am doing great, thank you for asking. It is a pleasure connecting with you today. Since it's the first time we are connected with each other, may I know your good name or how would you want me to address you?

31/07/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's my pleasure too
31/07/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I would even like to inform you that this group wants equal participation of Parents if the student is unavailable, and it would be appreciated if you share your reasons for not connecting beforehand if you or the student is not available.

As the admission process discussion is likely to finish within 4 days, so please be attentive so we can carry the process smoothly without any delay. I hope we are clear on this?
31/07/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Very clear. Let's proceed. Thandekile's father will join us along the way
31/07/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that.  First of all, I would like to congratulate you and your family on making the decision to enroll Thandekile in the Edoofa program.

Our goal here remains the same: *To ensure that every Edoofian is treated with the same respect and care, and now that you've been accepted into the scholarship program, I'd want to walk you through the steps you'll be taking*
31/07/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, I would like to share that our available hours are from *12.00 pm to 04:00 pm* and our discussions will be held from *07.30 pm to 11.00 pm* so make sure that you are available during our discussion hours so that, our discussion will be carried out within the same duration. I hope you have taken note of our discussion hours?
31/07/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted. Thank you
31/07/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you
31/07/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I recently had a conversation with Ms. Harmehak, and she did brief me about Thandekile's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of her and must be working towards providing her with the best opportunities to kick-start her career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
31/07/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 360 7200: The Edoofa Scholarship program offers students the opportunity to get the best quality education and also creates them for employment from the best universities in India
31/07/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 360 7200: The counseling session went on very well. It was quite informative
31/07/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Edoofa Scholarship program is also affordable as compared to our local universities and offers students to earn while they work
31/07/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Good evening Ms Kirti, hello Ms Ndlovu, I'm Mr Moyo Thandekile's father. My apologies for joining the session late
31/07/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 715 2664: What had striked me most from the counseling session was to learn that Edoofa scholarship program parovidez  50% of the fees, it facilitates registration of children and reduces the registration fees from approximately 2000usd down to 300usd. The Earn as you learn program allows learners to earn credits that are subsequently exchanged for self sponsorship.
31/07/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I’m delighted to know that you had such a great experience and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.
31/07/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand.
31/07/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
31/07/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Thandekile 2K23JUL2165)* will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
31/07/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Thandekile  EWYL23E0495)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
31/07/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's clear Ms Kirti.
31/07/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Thank you for for the elaborate explanation Ms Kirti

Let's do it tonight at 8 if that is fine with you
02/08/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely alright. We shall reconnect at 08.00 PM.
02/08/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, as per our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect now?
02/08/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes we are ready
02/08/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/08/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Please go ahead
02/08/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We are ready Ms Kirti
02/08/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/08/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Please go ahead and explain
02/08/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/08/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/08/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes ma'am they are clear
02/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We are following ma'am
02/08/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/08/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/08/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Sorry to take you back a bit, will we receive assistance in writing the SOP?
02/08/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 715 2664: This message was deleted
02/08/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you get complete assistance. Also, @263773607200 please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
02/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you for the clarification. You can proceed
02/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes it sounds clear ma'am
02/08/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/08/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Ok. You can continue
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
02/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
02/08/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Let's 920. My internet is acting up
02/08/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 715 2664: This message was deleted
02/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand, in that case, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 PM. I hope you will be available.
02/08/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Ok. Thank you
02/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
02/08/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Likewise. Thank you
02/08/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
03/08/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good evening
03/08/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Initially the video explains how critical it is for the students to be teachable and be able to follow instructions from Edoofa. Edoofa offers mind transformative education, it creates the feeling of independence on students. Edoofa has robust systems for ensuring that students get the best  education program that ultimately improves the capacities of the students . Edoofa boasts of years of experience which are paying dividends - students are passing with flying colors, overtime they created a network of well accredited universities in India where edoofians are placed for the right kind of knowledge, attitude and skills. The SOP is very critical as the learner will get an opportunity to convince the admission board why they should admit her in that program of study. Application form should be taken seriously, completed on time with efficacy.
03/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Thandekile.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you for the detailed summary
03/08/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Thank you ma'am
03/08/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
03/08/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 360 7200: MaMoe Thande.vcf (file attached)

07/08/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good evening Ms Kirti. Hope you are well.
Lets pick up from where we left on Friday
07/08/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thandekile has completed all the tasks
07/08/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Please find above Thandekile's birth certificate
07/08/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 360 7200: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes
08/08/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes Ma'am
08/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
08/08/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes
08/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
08/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
08/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/08/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes i can only study at one university
08/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
08/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
08/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
08/08/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. It was explained in detail
08/08/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
08/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. It's clear
08/08/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
08/08/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. Please go ahead
08/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
08/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. We are following. Please proceed
08/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
08/08/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's very clear. Thank you very much
08/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
08/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Noted Thank you

However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Thandekile's higher education?
09/09/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 715 2664: Greetings Ms Kirti and the rest of your team. As a family we are doing well. We have just come out of our harmonised elections and people are yet to come to terms with the out come. The outcome was highly contested and criticised by many observer missions. It's difficult real to plan as we are not so sure of the socio-economic and the political future of our country. Ms Kirti with regards to our daughter's education we are  prepared to sacrifice everything for her sake even if things are difficult.
19/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Thandekile.

21/10/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 360 7200: Thandekile is at a boarding school and she doesn't have a phone.
She is using the statement of entry for her examinations
21/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 360 7200: I talked to the principal about it and they promised to share on Mondau
21/10/23, 10:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, you can share the document on Monday then, I hope you do not delay any more. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
21/10/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 360 7200: Monday

21/10/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 360 7200: Yes I still remember it
21/10/23, 10:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 360 7200: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 11:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 715 2664: My understanding of the admission process

1. Edoofa will share scholarship applications with several universities
2. Universities will respond and send offer letters outlining scholarship amount, tuition fee, accommodation and registration fees.
3. Then out of several offer letters from different universities we can make a choice of the university where we want our child to study considering factors such as affordability, rank of the university....
4. Registration fee will have to be made which may range between USD500 to USD 750.
21/10/23, 11:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 360 7200: So far so good Ms Kirti
21/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you so much.. We are waiting eagerly
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Understood
21/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We can proceed
21/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Thandekile, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We are following
21/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 360 7200: This is noted
21/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however since it is a Saturday today and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 2:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
21/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted. Let's connect on Monday then
23/10/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 360 7200: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 8:40 am - +263 77 360 7200: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 360 7200: Good morning. Please find  the statements of entry, one is our local examination board and the other is for Cambridge
23/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Thandekile,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic document, it is duly noted with us.
23/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good afternoon. We are ready
23/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are clear so far?
23/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes we are clear. We can proceed
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
23/10/23, 3:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Clear. Thank you for that, it will help us as a family during these harsh economic times
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
23/10/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's clear. We appreciate the contribution from Edoofa
23/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
23/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
23/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's clear. Will you share the list of the best universities in India for us to go through? Do we have an option of declining an offer from a university in preference for another?
23/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, as you are aware that we are connected with 250+ universities hence providing you with a list will be impossible for us, however, yes you do have the complete right to decline the offer letter from the university if it is not according to Thandekile's preference.
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Ok. Will check them over the internet
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
23/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Please provide me with more information
14/11/23, 10:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Thandekile,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 05:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 05:30 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
14/11/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 360 7200: Good morning Ms Kirti. Thank you very much for sharing the news with us. We are happy and look forward to connecting in the evening.
Lets connect at 700pm
15/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 360 7200: In the meantime we will go through the offer letter
15/11/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Thandekile,

I hope you are doing well. I am happy that you were able to acknowledge the offer letter, that is alright please I am looking forward to connecting with you at 07:00 pm today.
15/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good evening Ms Kirti
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes we are ready
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted. Let's proceed
15/11/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 360 7200: 1. 900 USD
2. 3 years
3. 300 USD
4. 750 USD
15/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It does. Thank you
15/11/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted
15/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 360 7200: In the first year when she is still getting used, I would prefer that she pays for on-campus accommodation
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Accommodation yes but I miseed the transportation part
15/11/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your concern here. The off-campus accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well?
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 360 7200: That's clear. Thank you
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted. Let's proceed
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes we are together.
In our last discussion we talked about the option of declining an offer and opting for another. How does it look like now?
15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/11/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's clear. Let me Google  the universities in India and will let you know. I currently do not have any preferences at the moment
15/11/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
15/11/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted. Kindly shed light on the transfer option
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Glagotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 360 7200: That's good news. Thank you for the clarification
15/11/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, hence securing the seat is an important part, I hope you understand now?
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes.
In the meantime we wait for the Acceptance Letter from the University?
15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are ready to discuss the offer letter?
15/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. Let's proceed
15/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, however, since our available hours for today are over we will be reconnecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm I hope you will be available to connect with us without any delays.
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 360 7200: My apologies I am not available during the day. Can we reconnect same time tomorrow at 0700 pm
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if Mr. Moyo will be available to connect with us during the day time?
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 360 7200: He is busy nowadays unfortunately.
15/11/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, it is fine let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time. I hope you will be available.
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 360 7200: I will be available. Thank you for your understanding
15/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
16/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good evening Ms Kirti
16/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Thandekile.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if we can connect now with regards to our conversation yesterday?
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Evening
Network is bad. We may proceed now
16/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 360 7200: My apologies for that
16/11/23, 8:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, we can connect now. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted. Let's proceed
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We are together
16/11/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Yes. Please do
16/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 360 7200: That's clear and the payment options  will help us in planning as a family
16/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We really appreciate the support from Edoofa
16/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you. Will do. Looking forward to connecting tomorrow
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
17/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Network problems
17/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that network can be a challenge. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We are in Bulawayo
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Ok. Don't you have anyone on Bulawayo?
Last time we made a deposit to someone who is in Masvingo. Have forgotten the name. Harare is another city
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Please do. We would use Mr Shorwi's account
17/11/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you very much
17/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Will send a POP once we have paid
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we will get to that later, may I know if you were able to go through the breakdown above?
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Would prefer the on campus accommodation in the first year. Then later we can decide once she has adjusted
17/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Use on campus accommodation
17/11/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand your inclination towards the on-campus accommodation, as per my thoughts I believe you are concerned about the security and safety of the off- campus accommodations, and hence you wish to opt for campus accommodation may I know if I am correct?
17/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 360 7200: You are correct. But it appears you used the off campus cost. I stand guided
17/11/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.

18/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted thank you.
700pm then
18/11/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 07:00 pm Monday yes, please.
18/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Have a great weekend
20/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Thandekile.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, I am looking forward to connecting with you at 07:00 pm today.
20/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Ok
20/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good evening Ms Kirti. I hope you had a wonderful day.
We are ready to connect
20/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, my day is indeed going well, and I hope the same for you. I am glad to connect with you again, so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 71 622 4662: I've managed to go through the conversations and im happy please clarify on the total cost per annum with on campus accommodation
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 622 4662: We are together with Mum she is having challenges with  her network
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that network can be a challenge, let us continue with our discussion and once she is connected to a stable network she can go through our conversation, may I know if this sounds acceptable?
20/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes please
20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
20/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes its  clear and im happy for the opportunity
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Yes its clear
20/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 360 7200: I  have managed to catch up. We can proceed
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 360 7200: All is clear. Let's proceed
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

20/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

20/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
20/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
20/11/23, 8:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 22nd of November . We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We have seen the offer letter as parents
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Very exciting indeed
20/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Clear will do that
20/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great evening ahead.
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Thank you
We connect at 0700pm on the 22nd right?
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, we can I am looking forward to connecting with you on 22nd.
20/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Likewise. Good night
22/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Thandekile!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective? <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 622 4662: Good evening. We managed to go through the offer letter and we are excited by the opportunity
22/11/23, 8:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
22/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 622 4662: We as a family we felt its worth to embrace the opportunity. We believe EWYL will help reduce the financial burden on the family .
22/11/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
22/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Sorry to take you back, kindly summarised the total cost per annum including on campus accommodation
22/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you here.

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum On-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $2000

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $2000 = $4000
22/11/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, if you see this cost it is expensive and hence our students want off-campus accommodations because even if the students are inclined towards the on-campus accommodations after they arrive in India, they realize that off-campus accommodations are better as they provide the same facilities at a cheaper cost.
22/11/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Noted. Thank you.
22/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Last time we spoke we had made a mistake. We will discuss as a family
22/11/23, 11:05 pm - +263 77 360 7200: I totally agree with you but she can't just opt for of campus first time she arrives. She needs to acquaint herself first before opting for off the campus accommodation
22/11/23, 11:05 pm - +263 77 360 7200: As a result 4000 per annum will be too steep for us as a family
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Thandekile.

I hope you are doing well. See I completely understand where you are coming from, if I were at your place I would have the same thought process, however, let me share a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians who are staying off-campus together with Indian students and how they celebrated Diwali together one of the biggest Indian festivals, and you can see how very well even the girl child feel at off-campus accommodations.
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good evening Ms Kirti.
My apologies for responding late. I was traveling
23/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 360 7200: This means if we offer for off campus accommodation our annual total stands at 2800
23/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 360 7200: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 360 7200: As shown here
24/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Thandekile.

I hope you are doing well and this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
24/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Good afternoon Ms Kirti
24/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 360 7200: We are ready. Please go ahead
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now that you are clear with the cost breakdown. I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
24/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 360 7200: It's clear now. Let's proceed
24/11/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
24/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 360 7200: I haven't had the chance to do so. But will do it on Monday. Been busy traveling
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
24/11/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

24/11/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
24/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 360 7200: I will pay 300 before the 28th of November
24/11/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
24/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 360 7200: Will deposit in Mr Shorwi's account
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly.

This will enable me to promptly confirm the transaction with our accounts team and notify the university officials. Remember, I am here to assist you, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you require any support or guidance during this process. 

With that, we will be bringing our today’s discussion to a close. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
