21/10/23, 8:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Pardon,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 109 9352: Ok how are you
21/10/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 109 9352: Yes I’m available
21/10/23, 11:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 109 9352: Ok I remember
21/10/23, 11:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 109 9352: That’s the 5th stage where we are now as I’m waiting for acceptance letter from the university .I guess after the letter there is need to pay the admission fee
21/10/23, 11:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, if you do not recall, I understand it has been a long time, we have completed step3 and will move toward step 4 now.
21/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 78 109 9352: Ok yaaa I guess long time
21/10/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
21/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 109 9352: Ok you can
21/10/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
21/10/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
21/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 109 9352: Ok I get you
21/10/23, 11:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
21/10/23, 11:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
21/10/23, 11:39 am - +263 78 109 9352: Ok I got you
21/10/23, 11:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
21/10/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 109 9352: No question yet
21/10/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 11:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 109 9352: Thank you I appreciate
21/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 109 9352: Ok
21/10/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 11:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 11:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 109 9352: Yaaa I understand the benefits
21/10/23, 12:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 12:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Pardon, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok understood
21/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes it has resonate
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
22/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok  understood
23/10/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Pardon,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Pardon,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 11:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 109 9352: I understand
26/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 109 9352: I think according to my performance l can get at least 10 points
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you will, however, it is our responsibility to give you choices. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Olk wah about the second option
26/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 109 9352: So if l finish my education is there opportunities to get employed in India
26/10/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me provide you with some insight. Yes, indeed, after completing your degree in India, you will have the opportunity to seek employment there. As an organization, we are committed to your success. We have colleges that offer placement programs, connecting students with well-known companies that provide job opportunities. The EWYL program is a crucial component in this process. Not only does it allow you to earn credits, but it also equips you with essential 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability upon completing your studies.

I trust that this explanation addresses your query.
26/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes indeed it does
26/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 109 9352: No queries
26/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok Yaa sure
26/10/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok have a good day
27/10/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Pardon.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
27/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Jus that I’m too curious about the university which I will I choose ..when are you going to send  the letters 😊
27/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand and I can clearly see your enthusiasm, however. This is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry. However, we look at the positive side of this, you are getting more time to prepare your finances as well and you can save accordingly, right?
27/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Thanks Ms

15/11/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok so you mean the registration fee is needed in 15 days  starting from today or
15/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. However, I would encourage you to be patient. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 109 9352: So as they said I receive a 50% scholarship..So totally the amount which is being needed by this university ranges to which figure
15/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Please Note: A Level Results Pending, please submit before registration, else your admission will be cancelled …so does this mean that the registration is done after Alevel results are out
15/11/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263781099352 your cost of education is within the range that your counselor shared with you which is $2000- $3000 only, it will not exceed this. I would like, encourage you to be patient as we move ahead with our discussion all your concerns are going to get answered.
15/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your concern here if you recall our previous discussions, for a student to receive a 50% scholarship he/she should have at least 2E passes. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.
15/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear now?
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok you mean that figure will will satisfy the costs mentioned on the University fee structure  , Hostel / residential detail
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please do not worry about that. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Can you also explain on this statement:: Note: Student may choose out-campus private apartment on monthly sharing basis at the cost 1200 USD per annum with self-cooking facility.
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok yes I’m clear
15/11/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263781099352 yes I will be explaining every query that you have, however, I would request that you note down all your concerns at once so that we can discuss them at the end of the letter discussion. As I mentioned above The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Tuition fee per semester is 1800
Stands duration for my course is 3 years 
Admission fee is 300
And registration is 750
15/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 109 9352: So is the 1200 included in the 2000 to 3000 figure
15/11/23, 12:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please let me know that amount of tuition fee per semester after the scholarship please?
15/11/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to that part of the discussion as well.
15/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 109 9352: I guess it’s 900
15/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok sure
15/11/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes sure
15/11/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 109 9352: I would like the first option with three seater
15/11/23, 1:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok I get you
15/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes lests move
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes we are
15/11/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes you can explain
15/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes sure thank you I understand
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 109 9352: I’m in Kwekwe
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok thank you
15/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Understood
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Yes send the details
15/11/23, 1:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
15/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok thank you
15/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok thank you it’s affordable
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok sure
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 109 9352: Ok that’s pretty well sure
15/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 109 9352: I will focus with EWYL
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 109 9352: No queries now u explained it well
15/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?

I hope you're doing well and you had a great weekend thank you for asking, I am doing great and since we were not available yesterday because of the weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?

27/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 109 9352: How are you doing
27/11/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am doing great, thank you for asking. I was able to go through your message above and I would like to understand. As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
27/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 109 9352: I’m paying today
27/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 109 9352: But why is the account number you gave me different from the one I used though the person is the same
27/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 109 9352: For $200 the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $222 ($200+ $22 transfer charges as this is an international transaction and so the bank charges an 11% fee), and the process would be similar, you would be visiting the bank branch and depositing the fee in his account, the same details are as below:-
