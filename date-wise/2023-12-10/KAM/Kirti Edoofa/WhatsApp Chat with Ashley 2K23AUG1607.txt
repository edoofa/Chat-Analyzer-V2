12/09/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes go ahead
12/09/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
12/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes they're
12/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes there are
12/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/09/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Let the session begins at 0400 am tomorrow
12/09/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773508876 Please, note that 04.00 am CAT is ahead of our working hours, please and India is already 3.5 hours from Zimbabwe, so connecting at 04.00 am will not be possible for me.

16/09/23, 8:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, I am please to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
16/09/23, 8:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

Business process management (BPM) refers to the systematic design, implementation, execution, monitoring, and improvement of business processes within an organization. BPM aims to optimize business processes to achieve improved efficiency, effectiveness, and overall performance.
The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle typically consists of four phases which includes,

 Firstly there is a design , this phase involves defining the processes and their goals, identifying the stakeholders, and mapping out the process flow from start to finish.

Secondly, modeling  in this phase, the process is further refined and optimized through the use of modeling tools such as flowcharts and data diagrams. The focus is on ensuring that the process achieves its intended objectives while minimizing waste and inefficiencies.

Thirdly there is execution ,Once the process has been designed and modeled, it is implemented for actual use. This may involve automating certain aspects of the process using software tools or integrating with existing systems.

Lastly there is monitoring and Improvement , the final phase involves monitoring the process to identify any issues or inefficiencies and making improvements as necessary. Data analytics may be used to identify trends and patterns that can inform future optimizations. This phase is ongoing and iterative, as the process is continuously evaluated and improved over time.
29/09/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 595 6693: 3. Economic development refers to the process by which a country or region experiences sustained growth in its economic activities over time. It involves increasing productivity, generating wealth, and improving living standards for people within the economy. Businesses contribute to economic development in several ways, that include.

Job Creation, Businesses provide employment opportunities for people and help reduce unemployment rates. This leads to increased income for individuals, which in turn stimulates economic growth.

Moreover, Innovation and Technology, Businesses drive innovation by investing in research and development, which results in the creation of new products, services, and technologies. This helps industries become more efficient, cost-effective, and globally competitive.

Furthermore, Tax Revenue, Businesses generate tax revenue through corporate taxes, payroll taxes, and value-added taxes (VAT). This revenue is then used by governments to fund public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.

In addition ,Export Earning, Businesses that export goods and services contribute to foreign exchange earnings, which can be used to pay for imports, service debt, and boost the country's overall economic performance.

For example, a software company can contribute to economic development by creating jobs for programmers, developers, and other professionals, investing in research and development to create innovative software solutions, paying taxes on their profits, and exporting their software products to earn foreign exchange.
29/09/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 595 6693: 4.Suppose that there is a project team consisting of several members with different skill sets and responsibilities. As a manager, my job would be to ensure that all team members are working efficiently towards the project's goals. To achieve this, I would.

Firstly, clearly define the project objectives ,This will help everyone on the team understand what they need to accomplish and the expected outcome.

Secondly ,Delegate tasks, Assigning specific responsibilities to each team member based on their strengths and expertise will ensure everyone is working effectively towards achieving the goals.

Thirdly, establish communication channels, Effective communication is essential for any team, so establishing regular check-ins and clear communication channels will help keep everyone on the same page.

Forthly there is monitor progress, Regularly monitoring the team's progress and providing feedback will help identify potential issues early and allow us to make adjustments as necessary.

18/10/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with Ashley's EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. I appreciate you sharing that. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
18/10/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
18/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes proceed
18/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
18/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
18/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Lets continue tomorrow
18/10/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that you must be tired, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30. I would require your active participation for 2 hours tomorrow, so please I request you to adjust your schedule accordingly.
18/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Thank you
19/10/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress?

20/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 350 8876: I am considering that you can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm

So I would suggest that we connect at 02:00 pm CAT.
20/10/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you during the day however it seems like you are not available to respond, may I know if we are still connected @263714008973 @263773508876?
21/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Ashley,

I was hoping to get a response from you however it seems like you are not available to respond, your absence has been having a negative impact on Ashley's scholarship, I hope you are aware that the 2024 admissions are now open through Edoofa, and these delays will make Ashley behind the peers, which is not a good sign, may I know if we are still connected?
21/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Yes. Yesterday there was poor network
21/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Yes we discussed with her Mento yesterday

I will give you the briefing in thirty minutes time
23/10/23, 2:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Ashley.

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning Ashley's university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Thank you. Go on to the next stage
25/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
25/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/10/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
25/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Proceed to discuss each of them in detail
25/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/10/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/10/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Ashley, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Understood. You can proceed
25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Yes, it resonates with me
25/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
25/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/10/23, 11:04 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Let us proceed to the second benefit
25/10/23, 11:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over, so let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm. I hope you will be available.
26/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Waiting for this message
15/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Ashley,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, MVN University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
15/11/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 05:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
15/11/23, 10:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

26/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Yes
27/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley

I hope you're doing well and you had a great weekend we were not available yesterday because of the weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion since the deadline for Ashley to reserve her seat with the university is really near and we have not been able to discuss the letter so far, I would please like you to be a little proactive please.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Yes . I am available
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 400 8973: It's just that we are experiencing network problems for the past three days
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand, however, the deadline dates here are stated by the university and we have not been able to discuss the letter so far, so I hope you understand what I am trying to say here?
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes Ms Kirti. Go ahead
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, so may I know if you are clear so far?
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
27/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 350 8876: I have gone through.Go ahead
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1500, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes , this is clear to me. Ashley is a her not his. Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I have updated the same. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
27/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes. You have demonstrated how the program EWYL can be advantageous
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that she will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of her education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
27/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes you are clear
27/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $1200 to $1800 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
27/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($1200 to $1800).
27/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
27/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes, it makes sense
27/11/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Ashley is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
27/11/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
27/11/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
27/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 350 8876: I agree
27/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
27/11/23, 11:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, so l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
28/11/23, 5:12 am - +263 77 350 8876: So l will pay only $500-00
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 350 8876: At 1600 hours . I will be at home and free that time
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I shall wait for your response.
28/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 400 8973: Good Evening Ms Kirti.  I am waiting for your response
28/11/23, 5:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me it was my dinner break, however, we can connect now, may I know if you are available now?
28/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 350 8876: I hope you had the most wonderful dinner today. Yes we can connect
28/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please it was good. Yes, we can connect now, so may I know if you are clear so far?
28/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Yes
28/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 29, 2023*.
28/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 1:02 am - +263 77 350 8876: Yes, go ahead explain the payment plan
29/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley.

I hope you are doing well since we were unable to connect with each other may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can have a discussion regarding Ashley's university admission?
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Now l am available
29/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
29/11/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now since your deadline has already been crossed, and I understand that you were occupied with your work and network issues made is difficult for us to connect, and so I was able to discuss the same with the academic board and they told me that the round of applications will be closing for this month on the 30th of November, so may I know how much have you been able to raise so far?
29/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 350 8876: I will come back to you.
29/11/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know when can I expect an response from you?
29/11/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 350 8876: Will come back to you on Saturday
29/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773508876 I hope you are aware that the round of applications close tomorrow, and I will not be able to assist you after that in securing Ashely's seat with the university?
30/11/23, 8:08 am - +263 71 400 8973: Morning. I am on Saturday thus when l will know how much l have after consulting my wife who is not here. She is coming on Saturday
30/11/23, 8:09 am - +263 71 400 8973: I mean on Saturday thus when I will know how much I have after consulting my wife who is not here. She is coming on Saturday
30/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ashley.

 hope you are doing well. I understand what you are trying to say here however, please understand that I will not be able to assist you after today since the university will be closing its round of applications for this month. Since you were not able to connect with us on time, and the letter discussion took time to complete, I was always reiterating the importance of the letter however I understand that the network challenges can be an issue to connect.
30/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 350 8876: How do l pay
30/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/11/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
30/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 350 8876: I will be in Harare tomorrow. 
I stay in Murambinda
30/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 350 8876: I will clear the balance before the 28th of December
30/11/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
30/11/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
30/11/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?

Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $1000 - $150 = $850

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $850 + $60 = $910

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $455 (Paid on 1st December 2023)

Balance Amount Due: $910 - $455 = $455

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $455 is to be paid on or before the due date of 29th December 2023. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process. <This message was edited>
