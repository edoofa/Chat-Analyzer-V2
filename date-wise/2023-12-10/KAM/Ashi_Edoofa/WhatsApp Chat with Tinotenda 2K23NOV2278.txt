09/12/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/12/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

09/12/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good @263787769698. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders.

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
09/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

I have understood.
09/12/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263787769698 Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
09/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 776 9698: Yws madam.

09/12/23, 3:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

09/12/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 776 9698: 2.) User interface it is the space when  interaction between humans and machines occur.The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of machine while the machine simultaneously feed back information that aids the operator's decision making process.
The UX ( Unix) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating system that derive from original AT and T Unix.
User interface is the process of developing and creating menus and tools that allows users to  navigate a digital product .This I includes website, mobile apps and TVs .
The user interface design focuses on anticipating what user might need to do and ensure that the interface has elements that are easy to access, understand and use to facilitate those action.

The UX focus on how users interact with products .It ensure that a website or app is intuitive and easy to navigate.UX design focuses on creating a meaningful user experience by understanding user needs, conducting research and design intuitive interface.

3.) OSI model describe the activities process and standard protocol used for cross system communication.The communication between computer system are split into seven different abstraction layers which are physical,data , network, transport, session, presentation and application.

Physical layer
Its function is to transport data using electrical, mechanical or procedural interfaces.
It deals with data in form of bits .

Data link layer
It is the second layer of the seven layers . This is the protocol layer that transfer data between nodes on a network segment across physical layer.

Network layer
It is the part of the internet communication process where these connection occurs by sending packets of data back and forth between different networks

Session layer
It manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application.

Presentation layer 
Prepares data for the application layer. It is responsible for reformating compressing and encrypting data 

Application layer
It allows the user to use data access  and use network.

4.) Programming is the process if writing codes to facilitate specific action in computer.It is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task.
We have four types of programming languages which are imperative, functional, logical and object oriented.
Programming language is made up of specific terms and directions that are used to create some type of outputs  such as website,apps and other software language like Juvascripts and Python . 

Programming languages like JavaScript are the most commonly coding language used because most browsers utilize it and it is easy to learn.This types of programming languages are mainly used because they are fast and they runs immediately within a web browser and reduce loading time.
09/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 776 9698: 5.) A compiler is defined as a software that transforms an entire set of source code into object code and saves it as a file before executing it. Conversely, an interpreter converts and executes source code line by line without saving it and points out errors along the way.

 Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.

Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once. 

A compiled language is converted into machine code so that the processor can execute it. An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.
  A compiler translates high level language to machine language, at which point it can be translated at any time. To the contrary, an interpreter both translates and executes the high-level language.
