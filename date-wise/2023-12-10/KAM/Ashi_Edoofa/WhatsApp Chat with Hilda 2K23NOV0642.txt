07/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. Visit Your School: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. Provide Necessary Information: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. Printing and Signing: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. Include Authority Details: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
07/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?

09/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
09/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 579 2587: They are
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 409 1814: Following

09/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
09/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/12/23, 1:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 579 2587: They are clear
09/12/23, 1:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
09/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 579 2587: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Yes please

09/12/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 579 2587: Alright
09/12/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

Edoofa's vision is to get students affordable and quality education and also making students employable through SEELS
09/12/23, 2:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good @263775792587 Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
09/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
09/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
09/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
09/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
09/12/23, 2:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
