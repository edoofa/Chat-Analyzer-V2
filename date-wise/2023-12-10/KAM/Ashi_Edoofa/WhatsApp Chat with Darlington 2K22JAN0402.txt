31/07/23, 1:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
31/07/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 973 3211: Hello the payment of the balance will be until the next due date of the two installments
31/07/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 973 3211: I wanted to ask about food and accommodation please
31/07/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 973 3211: Hello
03/08/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 973 3211: Alright sir, I wanted to know that if I were to live off campus and want to eat food at the canteen, is it possible to do so and how much would I have to pay for food only without accommodation on campus
03/08/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Darlington!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/08/23, 12:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Darlington, Canteen and Hostel Mess are two different places dear. Having on-campus accommodation means that you will be having all your food and meals in the Hostel Mess itself. Whereas the Canteen is situated on the campus where other food items such as snacks, beverages, etc. are available.
03/08/23, 12:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: This means while living off-campus, you will surely have the access to the Canteen, however, mess facility won't be available for oyu.
03/08/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 973 3211: Alright so is it possible for me to pay the accommodation fee for off campus so that you as the edoofa team can find a good place for me to live before I arrive there, so as to avoid any inconveniences
03/08/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 973 3211: A place that which is very  suitable and also near the campus
07/08/23, 12:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Darlington!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/08/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 973 3211: Good afternoon
07/08/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Darlington, regarding your query, you do not need to pay any accommodation fee as of now since without that as well the Department of Student Welfare here at Edoofa will be helping you with the accommodation in your initial days here in India. Once you will be settled with that, only then you need to pay for that. I hope this is clear? <This message was edited>

Hence, can you please let me know by when are you planning to clear the balance so that I can inform the university officials of the same as well and then we can move ahead to the next steps.
10/08/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if I may ask what happened due to which you are seeking an extension with that please?
10/08/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 973 3211: Things could not work out as expected today but I assure you that I am going to pay off the balance
10/08/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I completely understand that. However, can you please let me know what happened due to which you were not able to raise the balance fee as of now?
10/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 973 3211: We were expecting to get the money from our small poultry project, but unfortunately the business started late and now we are keeping up with the busy schedule so as to make ends meet
10/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 973 3211: There were many adjustments to be made and we couldn't get the money from people we expected but we will certainly pay up the balance
10/08/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand where you are coming from, however, in that case, I am ready to help you as well. Hence, can you please let me know by when do you think you will be able to raise the balance fee as well?

Please bear with us as we try by all means to meet the requirements although there was a disturbance to our original plan. I really hope to  depart this year for the September intake so that I could begin my studies as soon as possible, so let us see how it turns out.

20/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 769 5166: Good afternoon, that has been the question since we couldn't make it for September.

Regarding your concern as you remember our last conversation about the last date of arrival in India is 30th of October shared by the University and that is the reason we were working with you in order to insure your arrival till 30th of October. However due to the reasons beyond our control you ended up not boarding your flight. 

Now, The window is closed for the arrivals, we would have to once again connect with the university to understand their preparation and to see that if it's possible for you to come in India in the next 15 days. Alternatively, If the University shared the unexpected response then the only possibilty for you is to join the next year academic intake which is August 2024. We have already reached out to the University to get an update on this once we get their response we will let you know.
