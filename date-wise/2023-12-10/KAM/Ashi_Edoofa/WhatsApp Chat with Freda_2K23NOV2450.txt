07/12/23, 12:37 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: We are fine thank you.
How are you?
07/12/23, 12:38 pm - +265 999 95 13 02: We're okay, that side?
07/12/23, 12:41 pm - +265 999 95 13 05: Pretty good
07/12/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Noted Freda, Since this is the first time we are interacting with each other, I'm eager to learn more about you. Could you kindly provide an introduction of yourself and also share details about your family, sponsor, or guardians who will play a role in shaping your educational plans?
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Well. My name is Freda Mbozi. I was born on the third of April 2002. I am 21 years of age. I was born in a family of 3. However we have lived as an extended family of 8 for almost all my life. My father being the first born of his family, he is also is responsible for looking after his other 3 brothers hence totaling to 8 when I include my mother, older brother and little sister. As I was clocking towards 2014. I was lucky enough to be selected to a government school known as Chichiri Secondary School where I did my secondary school (high school) education and was able to complete in 2018. 2019 through the help of my family and other well wishers I started my Bachelor’s Degree program in Business Administration- Management at Malawi Adventist University though the fees gathered was only able to carter for two years. In my Second year I was able to find a part time job where I worked at Lagra Centre Branch as an Administrative assistant from Fridays to Sundays giving me a chance to attend classes during weekdays. Knowing the financial situation we had I would exceed the normal credit hours or courses I was required to take with three 4 extra courses of the upcoming semester on conditions that I do not fail even one course by our academic advisor and head of department which I fulfilled finishing in my 7th semester and not my 8th. I finished in august 2022 but my graduation occurred in July 2023.

The sponsor or rather guardians has been my father but my brother comes in here and there.
07/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your inspiring journey with me. It's evident that you've faced various challenges throughout your academic path, yet your determination and hard work shine through. Congratulations on completing your Bachelor's Degree program in Business Administration-Management at Malawi Adventist University. 

It's heartening to hear about the support from your family, especially your father and brother, as well as other well-wishers. Extended families often provide a strong foundation, and your story reflects the strength that comes from such bonds.

I can imagine the pride your family must feel, and you should be proud of yourself as well. Graduating in July 2023 is a significant accomplishment, and I'm sure it marks the beginning of a new chapter for you. As you move forward, may your education and experiences continue to shape a bright and fulfilling future.
07/12/23, 2:31 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Thank you very much we really do truly appreciate it.
It’s really been nothing but testimonies
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @265996406762, Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention.

Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand.

07/12/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
07/12/23, 3:24 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Ok.
07/12/23, 3:25 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: The messages are loud and clear
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Alright
With my counselor we managed to cover four stages. 
Where the first stage look at a brief detail on both ends. Which was mine and Edoofa’s as well. It gave an insight and deep understanding on its goals and what it’s all about. 

Secondly, we have an eligible check where they’re were interviews and other necessary documents and questions 

After Edoofa’s serious consideration, I was luckily enough to be accepted into Edoofa’s scholarship program. Which is the third step.

Lastly, we we’re guided to the right enrollment processes. Which have been fulfilled.

Then the counselor said we leave the rest to here so believe  that’s why this group was made
07/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words and feedback about your counseling session. We're thrilled to see that you have shared such amazing insights with us. The guidance provided by your counselor is absolutely right, from now on we will be here for you to guide you further for your journey.

09/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/12/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/12/23, 3:51 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Very clear. Very interesting
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/12/23, 3:58 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Yes I’m on track
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/12/23, 4:04 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: If possible can you expand more on this

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

09/12/23, 5:17 pm - +265 996 40 67 62: Okay.
The videos in summary are explaining about the enrollment process and Edoofa’s vision for us scholars. It’s really comforting to know that Edoofa  has 20 years experience and takes its time to ensure and guide student towards their paths and education rather the right university selection. To top that off it’s other focus is on providing employable education which is very helpful.
The systematicness of the Edoofa’s process is very nice putting into consideration the example of the student from Ghana who tried to get their higher education in China.

However the statement of purpose is the most touching of them all because not only is giving a reflection to as why the student is the right fit but also giving a sense of self awareness
09/12/23, 5:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @265996406762 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
09/12/23, 5:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
