This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.

You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
25/10/23, 11:26 am - +27 81 750 2657: Okay noted with thanks. I am already currently in 2 groups are these two the ones or there will be other ones
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @27817502657 This is the admission group, you will be added in the EWYL group later. <This message was edited>

25/10/23, 12:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27817502657 Thank you for the confirmation. I am sharing the joining link with you, as I believe the numbers are private. Please share the link with your parents and do let me know once they are added in the group. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/EC5qIZsdcUmFGuufNE058P
25/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with Aaron's counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into his academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in his achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch his career. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 12:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about his counseling session with the counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
25/10/23, 12:56 pm - +27 81 750 2657: From the sessions we had so far. We are impressed to know that Aarons scholarship has a EWYL oppotunity, which is meant to equip him into a resourcesful graduate at the end of his degree by providing him some work expirience before hand. Also with a chance of attaining a 100% scholarship depending with the points he is going to earn in the process. This will impact a lot on the total amount which will be expected from us parents. Meaning he will be able to self finance.
25/10/23, 1:00 pm - +27 81 750 2657: We also understood that the programme is meant to produce industry ready candidates and it is to my best interest that after finishing his course he will be able to find work on an international stage.
25/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm truly delighted to hear that @27817502657. The EWYL program that aims to provide valuable work experience during his degree. This also lead to a potential which could significantly impact the financial burden. This, in turn, would empower him to become more self-reliant.
25/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

26/10/23, 2:53 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Well there is no problem and its very understandable Sir
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
26/10/23, 2:56 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes the last two parts are also clear. I can see this is a clear pathway which we are going to follow and its very critical for us to follow through until everything is completed.
26/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
26/10/23, 2:59 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes we can start. I think i have understood.
26/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
26/10/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
26/10/23, 3:05 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes you can send the videos  . But i would also want Aaron to watch them before we move to the next steps and he must also give his feed back
26/10/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @27817502657. I am sharing the videos with you, I am sure Aaron will gain some amazing insight from them.

Hence I would like to know by when do you think he will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly? <This message was edited>

28/10/23, 9:38 am - +27 61 139 7091: Morning sir, the principal of my school notify me this morning and fetch me to another school to have physics and maths clases
28/10/23, 10:13 am - +27 61 139 7091: So l don't think I will be able to complete the questions you sent me  yesterday
30/10/23, 3:18 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Good day Ashi, Like i explained in the Audio Aaron is busy with his English exam i cant get through to him yet. As soon as he is done he will be sending to you both documents. I understand this is for the student to answer not the parent. Isnt it?
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 3:20 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Its ok. Thank you
30/10/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 8:32 pm - +27 61 139 7091: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 6:29 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Good
31/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
31/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 6:37 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes
31/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $850.
31/10/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $850. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 6:45 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $850, you'll need to make a payment of $425 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $425 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
31/10/23, 6:48 pm - +27 61 139 7091: No , am okay
31/10/23, 6:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 6:49 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Yes
31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
31/10/23, 6:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
31/10/23, 6:54 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Good
31/10/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @27611397091, Have a Blessed day ahead and please extends our warm regards to your family.

22/11/23, 11:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Aaron, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

Let me explain this point to you, I hope you remember our previous conversation regarding the registration fees that to secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, known as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $100. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.

However, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I hope you understand?
22/11/23, 11:53 am - +27 81 750 2657: Hello Ashi, thank you for elaborating on this. We have understood. We can proceed with our session
22/11/23, 11:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27817502657, I am glad to know that you are ready for the session. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Aaron, I hope you are doing well.

With reference to my previous message, I believe you had a chance to go through them however we have not received your response. Considering the same, I would like to know if you are facing any challenges, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions.

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
24/11/23, 8:45 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Hello Ashi. I hope you are well. This is a fantastic opportunity for Aaron and i agree that the 100% waiver on accommodation will greatly reduce the financial cost which we are supposed to incur
24/11/23, 8:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Aaron, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

I am glad to hear your thoughts on the scholarship @27817502657, May I know if you are available for the further discussion please?
24/11/23, 9:04 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Lately i havent been so available for our sessions due to work commitments. I m so worried about this whole situation because the scheduled sessions comes mostly during the peek hours of the day when work is too tight. At the same time trying to work overtime to cover up for the balance for registration fee
24/11/23, 9:05 pm - +27 81 750 2657: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that you were occupied with your work commitment. I hope we will discuss the offer letter today, Regarding your concern about the deadline, we will discuss them as well in our session. With this note let's start our discussion for today. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 9:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
24/11/23, 9:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

24/11/23, 10:20 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Thank you. From the offer letter the total amount after the scholarship is US$1600, but for the 1st year there is an additional once of payment of $250 to add on to the $1600.
24/11/23, 10:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely right dear, I would like to share that my operational hours for day are over. With this, we will reconnect tomorrow at 10 am and move forward with our session, Please take a note of the timings and If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 08:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

25/11/23, 9:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of Aaron per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost

25/11/23, 9:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
25/11/23, 9:41 am - +27 81 750 2657: Thank you Ashi. I have read and understood the above mentioned list of facilities offered by the universities. It highlights the environment which the student will be staying in and i am assured that all these facilities works best to make student life easier and more productive.
25/11/23, 9:41 am - +27 81 750 2657: We can start our discussion regarding EWYL
25/11/23, 9:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that @27817502657. Now that we have established Aaron's total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
25/11/23, 9:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
25/11/23, 9:54 am - +27 81 750 2657: This is a great initiative and it shows how commited you are towards making sure that education is as affordible as possible to all students.
25/11/23, 9:56 am - +27 81 750 2657: Which is great to hear. I really understand and im sure it is also our duty as parents to offer all the support we can to our child so that he can perform at his best capacity.
25/11/23, 9:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am very delighted to see that you have clearly understood the importance of EWYL Program. With this, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with Aaron's hard work, he  earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
25/11/23, 9:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents.
25/11/23, 9:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how Aaron can effectively make his education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
25/11/23, 10:03 am - +27 81 750 2657: Yes i can see that it is a very helpful programme and depending with the childs commitment im sure there is a great chance to make the scholarship more or less 100%
25/11/23, 10:03 am - +27 81 750 2657: I would like you to clarify from your expirience how parents can contribute towards making that the child performs well.
25/11/23, 10:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Aaron will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. His mentors will undoubtedly provide him with valuable guidance to help him reach his academic and financial goals.

With this, you as a parents can motivate him to contribute his 100% towards his EWYL journey.
25/11/23, 10:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in the offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
25/11/23, 10:10 am - +27 81 750 2657: I am glad to hear that. We will always work
25/11/23, 10:12 am - +27 81 750 2657: We will always work with Aaron, motivating him so that it can also relieve us on his fees
25/11/23, 10:16 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see your dedication towards Aaron's Higher Education, really appreciate it. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in his offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after he arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
25/11/23, 10:21 am - +27 81 750 2657: I totally understand
25/11/23, 10:21 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @27817502657, Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
25/11/23, 10:22 am - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Aaron through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
25/11/23, 10:26 am - +27 81 750 2657: Yes you can explain
25/11/23, 10:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @27817502657, Let me explain the same for you.
25/11/23, 10:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
25/11/23, 10:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Aaron's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
25/11/23, 10:40 am - +27 81 750 2657: Yes everything is clear
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @27817502657, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
25/11/23, 10:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
25/11/23, 10:42 am - +27 81 750 2657: But regarding the other $350 for registration we were supposed to pay a balance of $150  and this amount is due today i wanted to know how much is the equivalent of R150 in Rands
25/11/23, 10:45 am - +27 81 750 2657: Also kindly note that the $1000 in the acceptance letter we ha had confused it with the other $1000 which will be paid when Aaron arrives in india
25/11/23, 10:47 am - Ashi Edoofa: @27817502657 Let me assist you here, as you have mentioned that your $150 are due for today for the enrollment fees when you convert $150 to rands, it would be around 2790.2 rands, I hope you understand the same.
25/11/23, 10:50 am - +27 81 750 2657: The payment plan is flexible but considering how i get money a payment of $425 as an initial payment within a week is a bit hard for me its a very short space of time. However i will try to work towards raising that amount. I have understood that to secure the scholarship its $1000 less $350 from Edoofa, and this is indepedent of the $850 which is to be paid next year after Aaron arrives in India
25/11/23, 10:50 am - +27 81 750 2657: Ok thank you
25/11/23, 10:52 am - +27 81 750 2657: If it is possible i would be glad to continue our session at 3 since i have a meeting to attend now as i mentioned earlier. I hope you have a great day ahead
25/11/23, 10:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: Well, dear. I can understand that It can be challenging for you to raise the amount of initial payment of $425 as due to your initial absence we were not able to discuss more about the offer letter which leads to such a small period of time. However, I really appreciate your positive approach to raise the amount, please note that if you faces any concern please share it with us. 

With this please allow me to correct you that Edoofa has given grant of $150 not $350, which reduce the registration fees to $850. With this, as you have a meeting now, we will resume our session at 3pm today. I hope you will be available for the session.
25/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Aaron, I hope you are doing well.

With this note, May I please know if you are available for the further session ?
25/11/23, 5:02 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Good day. I am now available for further sessions
27/11/23, 11:23 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Aaron, I hope you are doing well. 

Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you on Saturday, as by the time you reached out my operational hours were over. However, I would like to continue our session for today, on this note May I know when can we schedule our session please?
27/11/23, 11:28 am - +27 81 750 2657: Good morning Ashi. I totally understand we can start our session ASAP.
27/11/23, 11:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @27817502657, Let's start our session on this note, as you remember about our previous conversation we have shared understanding about the payment plan, I hope you remember the same. In reference to the same, Let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
27/11/23, 11:31 am - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
27/11/23, 11:48 am - +27 81 750 2657: We are staying in South Africa and the initial payment we did for the Enrolment fee was paid through Mama Money
27/11/23, 11:51 am - +27 81 750 2657: If possible we can use the same since it is more convinient for us. But regarding the payment of the Admissiin fee, i am kindly asking if you can adjust the deadlines for a later date. We are yet to pay the balance of $150 for Enrollment fee and we still need to pay the$425 as part payment for Admission fee
27/11/23, 11:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @27817502657. Sure, you can use Mama Money to pay your registration fees as it is convenient for you. Moving forward towards your concern, as your mentioned that you have a deadline for your enrollment fees and registration fees. On this note, I would like to understand the reason why you want to adjust the deadline, as you know that these deadlines are shared by the university.
27/11/23, 1:22 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Thank you for your response, kindly advice how much we are supposed to pay in rands for an equivalent of $150
27/11/23, 1:27 pm - +27 81 750 2657: And regarding the enrollment fee we are still trying to raise that amount, Kindly note that myself and both my parents are self employed and we are all trying to raise the money since we dont earn so much.
27/11/23, 1:33 pm - +27 61 139 7091: Good Afternoon sir , my apologies for this late question , l wanted to ask if there is other universities that l can compare , since you  mentioned that will have to choose between the universities
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27817502657 As we shared earlier that when you convert $150 to rands, it would be around 2790.2 rands. With this as you have mentioned that you are working on raising the funds for Enrollment Fees, May I know if you are talking about the registration fees or Enrollment fees please?
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Thank you. I am making a payment this afternoo
27/11/23, 2:07 pm - +27 81 750 2657: The registration fee is going to be paid today and we are busy raising the Enrollment fee
27/11/23, 2:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27817502657 I believe there has been some misunderstanding about the fees as you have mentioned that you will complete the registration fees today May I please know if you are going to make the payment of $425 for your registration at MVN University?
27/11/23, 2:28 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Yes we are paying the balance of $150 for registration fee today. The Enrollment fee is the one we  are still trying to raise as i mentioned earlier and that is why i requested deadline adjustment
27/11/23, 2:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, let me correct you here as $150 is the enrollment fees which is due for your enrollment in Edoofa program and the registration fees which is due by tomorrow is your registration fees which is needed to reserve your scholarship seat the the university, I hope you understand?
27/11/23, 5:22 pm - +27 61 139 7091: I understand you are very busy sir but when you find a gap my you please help me
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please excuse me @27611397091, Regarding your concern, I need to connect with the team to confirm about Aaron's application with other universities. Kindly allow me sometime to confirm the same.

30/11/23, 4:23 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Thank you so much Ashi for the insight, i am convinced that MVN University is a world Class academic hub which will ensure that Aaron can get the best education he needs. I have gone through the message and watched the video. Again thank you.
30/11/23, 4:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @27817502657, I am happy to hear your views about MVN University. However, I am bit concerned about the registration process of Aaron as you know that the deadline to reserve the scholarship is already passed, May I know if you are aware of the same?
30/11/23, 5:45 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Hir Ashi i am deeply worried also and i am very much aware that the deadline has come and past. I am working tirelessly trying to raise the money. If by any chance for Edoofa and the University to give us a little bit more time i will forever be grateful.
30/11/23, 6:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that you have been working hard to raise the amount to complete the formalities for registration process. However, you know the universities are also restricted with the due dates that they share with the students considering that there are only a limited number of seats and they have to be fair to each and every student.
30/11/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would want to help you out, For the same could you please let me know what challenge are you facing in raising the amount?
30/11/23, 7:29 pm - +27 81 750 2657: I am working as normal but the timeframe to raise the money is the one which is a bit tight for me considering that i also have bills so i am also busy trying to even borrow so and will have to pay the debt later.
30/11/23, 7:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand that raising the amount can be a challenge, and please let me help you here, As you mentioned that the university's due date of 15 days for payment is too short, I understand that raising the required funds is a challenge and to address the same, Edoofa has taken a proactive step to assist you by granting the Endowment Benefits. These benefits not only allow you to save $150 on the registration fee but also extend the payment period to 45 days.
30/11/23, 7:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given this additional time, I would like to understand your expectations regarding the due date, considering the universities have already helped you with the same. Before we helped you secure your offer letter from the university, we highlighted the registration fee amount in October 2023 and encouraged you to prepare your finances accordingly.
30/11/23, 7:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of these, Could you please help me clarify these so that I can help you with the solution to your challenge an ensure that Aaron's educational plans are not affected?
30/11/23, 8:21 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Well I do understand that we were issued with the offer letter in October but the honest truth is that we were still struggling to put together a balance of $150 for the enrolment fee as you have seen that we only had to pay it on the very last minute.
30/11/23, 8:24 pm - +27 81 750 2657: I really appreciated all the efforts from Edoofa to try to assist with a $150 waiver but if you can give us one more week we would have managed to pay the $425 which is being required. We are so worried that this oppprtunity might slip away but the honest truth is we dont earn much but we are trying our very best
30/11/23, 8:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your efforts towards Aaron's Educational journey, Moving forward with the challenge you have, as I have shared with you, we are here to assist you in finding a solution. Our goal is to ensure that you can secure Aaron's scholarship seat without facing unnecessary challenges. For the same, as you have mentioned that you need one week to raise the finances for the registration fees, Could you please let me know what are your plans to raise the funds and by when you will be able to make a deposit?
30/11/23, 9:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27817502657 I was expecting response from your side, since we were not able to connect today hence I would like to schedule our session tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
30/11/23, 10:10 pm - +27 81 750 2657: My apologies for the late reply. The only way i can have this money is to work long hours which is the reason why i delayed responding to you. I am still working. My source of income is through driving for Uber. The money takes effort to accumulate. The latest date is Friday next week. Also we are trying to borrow the money. Kindly note that we are trying by all means to raise this money so that Aaron can secure his seat

Hence, I would like to understand that what amount are you expecting to raise by this time, Could you please let us know?
01/12/23, 5:24 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Thank you for your response. I am sure by then i could have raised $300 i dont know if that can work
01/12/23, 5:25 pm - +27 81 750 2657: Unless if i get someone to assist me i will pay in ful
01/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @27817502657 In order to find a workable solution, I have been exploring the potential of establishing a payment plan. However, before finalizing this plan, it's important that we gain a comprehensive understanding of your current financial situation.

Hence, I wanted to reach out to you and understand the amount you are thinking to raise for Aaron's registration fee by the upcoming Friday. This detailed information will empower us to tailor our assistance in the most effective and personalized manner possible.
