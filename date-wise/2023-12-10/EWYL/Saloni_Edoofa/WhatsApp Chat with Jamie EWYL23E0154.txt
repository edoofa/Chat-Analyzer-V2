15/09/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 550 2050: How ur you? l have noted the session times,we can    start.

19/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Am fine thank you,let's begin
19/09/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Sure we're keen for our son to study abroad with students of other cultures so am sure you won't be disappointed
19/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
19/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you,go on.
19/09/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Very inspiring and encouraging after hearing you Salomi we can't wait
19/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Pardon me,Saloni sorry wrong spelling
19/09/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
19/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 550 2050: We are also happy you like working with young people.
19/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Maybe incorporating our young with the community and making sure they excel with their studies
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, you have got it!
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Jamie is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
19/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes thank you for cementing my understanding of your objectives
19/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
19/09/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thanks a lot it was really good communicating with you.
22/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Good afternoon yes you can go ahead
22/09/23, 12:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Am pleased to meet the EWYL team
22/09/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Even they are delighted to have you in the team!
22/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you
22/09/23, 12:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Please go ahead
22/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you have received the newsletter.
22/09/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes and have just finished reading it
22/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Am reading again
22/09/23, 1:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know which section if the newsletter you liked the most?
22/09/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Questions for you and the Edoofa oath
22/09/23, 1:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome!
22/09/23, 1:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Jamie's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
22/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 550 2050: It sounds great all the three goals are fantastic
22/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much!
22/09/23, 1:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Jamie will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
22/09/23, 1:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Sorry Saloni l need more time to read l had left my reading glasses at home had come some place for improved network
22/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you
22/09/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, not a problem at all.
22/09/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

26/09/23, 12:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go?
This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳ this week.
_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
26/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Thank you our weekend was alright
26/09/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
26/09/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Jamie can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 550 2050: Yes l understand
26/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Jamie is back, he/she is supposed to note a few things.
26/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
26/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
26/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
26/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
