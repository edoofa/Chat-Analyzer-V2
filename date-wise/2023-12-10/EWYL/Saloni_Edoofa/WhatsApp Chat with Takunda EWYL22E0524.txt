▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call.

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

Your hard work, passion, and dedication also helped you fetch other projects like Social Media, Community Relationship management, and whatnot. Your diligence and smart ideas always stole the show and therefore you got the grant as well at the meet and greet event. Both of us, you and me, maintained a lovely relationship, and hence this journey was not more than a dream come true for many.

Now, I want you to inspire others as well through your journey on how you have ended up earning more than $200 so far and you aspire to earn more and work hard like you used to do.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.

11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
I have understood that Edoofa is different from other agents in terms of its services. They assist the student till they are in their home country and also take the students to their respective universities after their arrival in India, which is not done by most agents. Edoofa also offers the student the ability to reduce their annual fee through their Earn while you learn programs.
Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa:                                                                                                                                                                    I have always had a passion to learn abroad and try and bring change in my family. Given the opportunity will help me to boost my skills to learn in a well developed and conducive environment. I am a hardworking person who is self motivated and not easily wiped away or attracted to stuff not related to my mission. My mission is to bring change and improve my lifestyle.I really look forward to such an opportunity so that my dream can come true.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
24/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
24/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 70097 69433: I think if I work hard all will be well.

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

08/12/23, 4:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
08/12/23, 4:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 9 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
08/12/23, 4:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *You are very close, trust me🥹*

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to request a shift in our IE Chat session from 07:00-08:00 PM due to the unavailability of students during that time. I hope you can accommodate this change.

Kindly confirm your acknowledgment at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

09/12/23, 7:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
