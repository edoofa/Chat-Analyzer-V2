I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

12/09/23, 8:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know till what time will you be occupied in school?
12/09/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 083 2660: From 7:00Am to 4:00Pm
13/09/23, 8:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: _Good morning!_
How are you doing this morning?
13/09/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
13/09/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 083 2660: Ok Ms l will inform them

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians.

May we begin with our session?
06/10/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've noticed that both Kudzi and the parents haven't been available for the Fastrack sessions we had planned.

Could you please share the specific obstacles or constraints you're encountering? This way, I can provide assistance and support tailored to your needs.

13/10/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
13/10/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I want to express my concern about the Fastrack sessions we had planned. Despite my consistent efforts to schedule these sessions and reminders, I've noticed neither Kudzi nor the parents are available. This lack of engagement has raised concerns about the progress and opportunities for Kudzi's  career development.
13/10/23, 12:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Active and involved parents can greatly encourage their students to excel, and I believe that with your participation, Kudzi's potential can be fully realized. I'm genuinely interested in understanding the challenges you may be facing so that I can assist you accordingly and ensure a bright future for Kudzi. Your involvement in this process is incredibly valuable, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Please share your thoughts and any obstacles you might be encountering so we can work together effectively.
13/10/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 083 2660: Thank you Ms
13/10/23, 12:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you are available to resume with the session now?
@263780832660
13/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 083 2660: For a short time
13/10/23, 12:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Kudzi can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
13/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 083 2660: Yes Ms
13/10/23, 12:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
13/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 083 2660: Let's hold it
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes we will put it on hold once you complete these basic formalities.
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂.

While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame.
