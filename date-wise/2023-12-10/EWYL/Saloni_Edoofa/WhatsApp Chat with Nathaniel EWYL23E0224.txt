01/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
01/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 980 3770: ok
01/08/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you know what is SEO and influencer marketing?
01/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 980 3770: those new terms to me
01/08/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, let me add to your knowledge!
01/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
01/08/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 980 3770: yaah now l get some sense
01/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That's great, Nathaniel!
01/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, Nathaniel, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
01/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 980 3770: ok mam
01/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 980 3770: so how will l be doing all this ,you can teache me
01/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I will help you achieve and learn all of this!
01/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Nathaniel, There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
01/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 980 3770: ok mam
01/08/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
01/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 980 3770: sama with me here ....greet those who just arrived on our behalf

02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to start a new journey🤩
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
02/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
02/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 980 3760: Thank you mam
02/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 980 3760: Batch for my session:Monday and Thursday
