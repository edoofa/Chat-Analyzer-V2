This is a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *01:30-02:30* PM this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
14/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 667 6332: Greetings !
14/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 667 6332: Well noted
14/08/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Kristy, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
14/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 667 6332: My short term goals are studying and passing with distinctions and being a motivational sumbody to other learners and being employed in someone's successful company. My long term goals are being a successful business lady managing one of the most leading company in the world , also to develop my country and also to create employment to youths that are not academical gifted .
14/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is so good, I got chills reading it and Kristy honestly, I heard all these words as if you were saying them, bold and confident⚡
14/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 667 6332: No I don't understand the two key objectives, may you explain further
14/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 667 6332: This is well noted.
14/08/23, 4:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me, no sessions will held tomorrow since our organization will be closed on Tuesday in observance of India's Independence Day🇮🇳
14/08/23, 4:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This significant day marks the birth of a sovereign India, a result of immense sacrifices and unwavering determination. Vibrant parades, flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural performances, and patriotic fervor color the celebrations across the country. It's a time to reflect on India's journey to self-governance and to honor the leaders who led the struggle for freedom.
14/08/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 667 6332: It's okay Ms Saloni, enjoy your day

17/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 667 6332: Its alright, thank you
18/08/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 667 6332: I believe that offering value before asking for value is a good idea because,offering value before asking for value is actually a really smart idea, and it's known as the "give before you get" principle. 
The basic idea is that by offering something of value to someone first, you build trust and rapport, and then they'll be more likely to give something back to you in return. It's a bit like the "Golden Rule" - treat others the way you want to be treated. 
This principle can be applied to all sorts of situations, from sales and marketing to personal relationships.
18/08/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Kudos Kristy for articulating the essence of the "give before you get" principle beautifully. Your succinct explanation highlights how offering value upfront fosters trust and reciprocity, akin to the Golden Rule. This principle's versatility across sales, marketing, and personal connections underscores its universal wisdom.
18/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 667 6332: Noted

21/08/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
21/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
21/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 667 6332: It's alright

21/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
21/08/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 667 6332: 1. Hello! My name is Kirsty Amuhelang Sebata. Iam a girl aged 18 and currently iam doing Upper Six. I live in Zimbabwe . Iam a zealous and fast learner who is looking forward to pursue a degree in  Barchelor of Business Administration.

2. My mentor has set two goals which are, 
i)ensuring that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st century skills, which ensures that the Edoofians are equipped for employment .
ii)Helping Edoofians to self finance their education 

3. Mr Angad Singh interact with students through newsletters 

4. The Hall of inspiration is a metaphorical place where ideas, creativity, and passion come to life. It's a place where inspiration is abundant, and where anyone can come to find the spark they need to create something amazing. The Hall of inspiration can be found in many places - a quiet walk in nature, a bustling city street, or even in the pages of a book. It's a place where you can let your imagination run wild, and where your creativity can take flight. It's a place where anything is possible, and where the sky's the limit.
21/08/23, 3:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 667 6332: That is well noted 😊
31/08/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

07/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 288 8300: Good afternoon. Kirsty is now back to school as schools are opened this week. It seems the school is not allowing them to use phones
08/09/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me. <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.

08/09/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 667 6332: Good evening Ms Saloni,  I have sent the mail
16/09/23, 10:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 288 8300: Noted Ms Saloni. You can go ahead as per your plans
16/09/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that you and your parents may have commitments here at the school, but it's important to recognize that you've come a long way already. You've successfully completed the counseling process and paid your enrollment fees, showing your dedication to this journey. Just as we follow a fixed timetable for classes and office hours, we have a similar schedule for these essential sessions.
16/09/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: I want to assure you that I value your time. On my end, I've streamlined the process to just a few days, and in some cases, it can even be completed in a single day. Your participation is crucial, and I kindly ask for your cooperation in acknowledging and attending these sessions. It's a small investment of time for the long-term benefit of your education and future success.
16/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 288 8300: That's very true thank you for kindness and effort
19/09/23, 12:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

04/10/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Kirsty will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
04/10/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 288 8300: Noted Ms Saloni
04/10/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Kirsty can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
04/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 288 8300: Thank you Ms Saloni
04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
04/10/23, 10:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
04/10/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 288 8300: It's in order Ms Saloni
04/10/23, 11:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once done, do let me know.
04/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 288 8300: Thank you
05/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 667 6332: Greetings Ms Saloni, I have gone through the document and I understand that the EWYL program will help me to know the market well , to know how to link with different companies .  The EWYL program will help me to be employable in the future and also achieve her career goals and working towards securing a bright future. In the today's world of Corona virus pandemic, the EWYL program bet two things which are  Awareness of how jobs of the future will look like and also Acquiring skills that will be required to perform the jobs.

18/10/23, 6:42 am - +263 78 667 6332: Yes, I agree with Ford s' approach, because if an enterpriser put more effort in work for example, working hard, managing the business or company, delegation,, bit by bit the enterprise can achieve growth objective .... A company will grow and make a lots of profit and an entrepreneur will even manage to pay better wages to the employees, and henceforth this makes an entrepreneur to be successful.

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

Please excuse me for the delay in reaching out, I was occupied in some important meeting that required my immediate attention but I am all ears now.
21/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 667 6332: Morning
21/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 667 6332: Yes , we may begin
21/11/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: Kirsty, we last discussed everything on project two until the scholarship credits were allotted for the same. Are you clear about it?
21/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 667 6332: Yes , it's clear
21/11/23, 9:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
21/11/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Kirsty/Saloni/21NOV2023*
21/11/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
21/11/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
21/11/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
21/11/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
21/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 667 6332: Noted, but unfortunstely in our school we were only 26 Form 6 students including me
21/11/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is completely alright Kirsty, what do you fear of then?
21/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 667 6332: I think i won't be able to reach the target
21/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no target for the number of participants, it was taken on the average students that are their in most of the schools. Please do not worry on that.
21/11/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 667 6332: Noted
21/11/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session for today but I am hoping to catch you tomorrow from 09:00-10:00 AM in the EWYL Group🏆
21/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 667 6332: Thank you
22/11/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Kirsty,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
22/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 667 6332: Good morning  , yes we may begin
22/11/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you work on forming the group that we discussed yesterday?
22/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 667 6332: Yes
22/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 667 6332: Hello, are we still connected .
22/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay Kirsty, I got a call that required my immediate attention.
22/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, have you added me in the group?
22/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
22/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
22/11/23, 9:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 667 6332: Thank you
23/11/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Kirsty,

23/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 667 6332: No doubts,
23/11/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward.

23/11/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟

24/11/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I checked my records and it shows that the school is not connected with Edoofa.

28/11/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
