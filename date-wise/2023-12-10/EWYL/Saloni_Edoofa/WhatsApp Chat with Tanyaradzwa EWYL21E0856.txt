You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

23/08/23, 4:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. 

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
23/08/23, 4:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*
13/10/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

How are you?
17/10/23, 3:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you understand that it comes from a place of concern when I express my feelings about recent developments. Tanyaradzwa, you're undoubtedly a talented student, and I hold high regard for your abilities. However, in recent weeks, there has been a noticeable shift in our dynamic, and it appears that my efforts and follow-ups have perhaps been taken for granted. I believe we can work together to find a better balance and ensure that your talents continue to shine while fostering a more mutually respectful mentor-student relationship. Your growth and success are essential to me, and I would appreciate your understanding as we navigate this situation together.
17/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Greetings ma'am. I understand now. Concerning the past few days back, I was occupied with exams till now. But I will be done tomorrow and start working bit by bit only everything you say.

Am I allowed to ask if I forgot some of the tasks since I was a little bit busy. Also I want to try to work on my time management and if it's possible I will try to create a timetable.

My apology for not participating ma'am. I wanted to but I'm still a learner on time management.

How are you?
20/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263782128653 Tanyaradzwa was given an amazing opportunity a month ago and he was asked to get you over the conversation here but I saw no response so I thought to personally reach out to you.
20/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: As part of the community-building project, the students have the opportunity to share their Edoofa journey with their peers, neighbors, classmates, relatives, and cousins. They can introduce them to what Edoofa is, and how it can benefit them, and share your own inspiring story. If they show interest, you can provide them with a student application form, and once they've filled it out, share their forms with me. Your enthusiasm and willingness to help others embark on a similar path are truly commendable. 🌟🌍📚
20/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, for the community building project, the student earned a total scholarship credit of $50. But now, we're excited to offer you an opportunity to earn not just $100, not even $200, but an impressive $300 for each student application form you submit to us!
20/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you feel about this opportunity given to Tanyaradzwa?
20/10/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263782128653

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

14/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 787 1937: So from now on, I will be active ma'am. My apologies for the past habit I did.

15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

17/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 787 1937: My understanding :

The story of Alex which illustrate his hardships in his life time and his experience. The consequences and problems he faced made him strong and I learnt a lot on how he overcome those problems.

My takeaways are, I don't have to give up. No matter what happens, even I have no solution I have to think of the solution. Though I'm down at the moment nothing can stop me to achieve every goal I want.

This also mskes me remember my weakness which is time management, I have to work hard on it. Even my body doesn't like, I have to move. Like Elon Musk once said, for you succeed work like hell, thus means the more effort you put the more you reap.

Conclusively hardworking, time management and critical thinking the work in hand to achieve the best.

27/11/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 787 1937: Since they are offline now

27/11/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 787 1937: Okay ma'am

28/11/23, 9:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Tanyaradzwa!
How are you?

We will have our session on the *GRANT* that you received, where we will talk about your performance and eligibility *today* from *06:00 - 07:00 PM* in the *EWYL Group only*.
It is necessary that the parents are there in the sesion.
28/11/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why were you not present yesterday for the session, isn't it important for you to know whether you are eligible to avail the grant or not?
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
28/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Yes ma'am, we can start.
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Sure ma'am.
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Yes ma'am, I recall the same.
28/11/23, 2:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Tanyaradzwa, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Yes ma'am, byt not everything.
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 787 1937: A few I mean
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Noted ma'am
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 787 1937: So according to point 3, if one didn't not pay the ( fees - grant) fees he or she will not be able to redeem the grant
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Noted ma'am, that's great. I will try to maintain the progress
28/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Noted ma'am, so I need to be consistent. The best is to stay active in EWYL group.
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is true
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Understood
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Noted ma'am
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 787 1937: I believe ma'am and I'm sure I will.
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Alright ma'am
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Yeah sure, so you may please share the plan
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Noted ma'am,
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 787 1937: But I have one request of time for session. I think it will be Ok if everything is set after 6 PM since most of my lesson end at 5 and I will travelling till home.
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 787 1937: Noted ma'am
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 787 1937: I'm capable of doing it ma'am and I have no doubt.
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The sessions on Wednesday are always after 6 PM and call, I try to schedule post 3 PM since my working hours are till 5 PM.
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 787 1937: I only have free time after 4 on Wednesday and Saturday.
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 787 1937: So no issue ma'am, I will try to adjust
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will resume on Thursday since I won't be available tomorrow due to some personal commitments. I will let you know the time of the session tomorrow only.
Thank you for joining in!

08/12/23, 4:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
08/12/23, 4:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 9 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening,

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to request a shift in our IE Chat session from 07:00-08:00 PM due to the unavailability of students during that time. I hope you can accommodate this change.

Kindly confirm your acknowledgment at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.
09/12/23, 3:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
I am super excited🚀
09/12/23, 7:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
