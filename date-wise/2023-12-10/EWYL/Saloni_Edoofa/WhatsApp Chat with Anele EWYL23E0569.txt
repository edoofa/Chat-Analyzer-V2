29/08/23, 8:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team.

I'll see you on *Thursday* from 08:30-09:30 AM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
31/08/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 715 3810: Greetings Ms Saloni
31/08/23, 8:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

How are you?

Let's begin with our session🚨
08/09/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263782164341 @263787153810
08/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 715 3810: Greetings Ms Saloni,  lm good how are you
08/09/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
08/09/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this, your determination to excel in your studies, secure a job aligned with your aspirations, and make a positive impact in your community is truly inspiring. Your pursuit of becoming a top lab technician and bringing innovation to the sector is commendable. Keep up the excellent work, and remember that we're here to support you every step of the way.
08/09/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
08/09/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 715 3810: Please explain
08/09/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
08/09/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
08/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 715 3810: Oky l understand
08/09/23, 8:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 715 3810: Looking forward to working with you all
08/09/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Even they are excited to see you working hard!
08/09/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
08/09/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
08/09/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/09/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
12/09/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
12/09/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/09/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 715 3810: Im done going through the pdf

12/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 715 3810: The one which has got quotes and questions
12/09/23, 9:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.

13/09/23, 10:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: As a small compensation, I'd like to share an intriguing fact about Zimbabwe with you. Did you know that Zimbabwe has the highest literacy rate in Africa, standing at over 90%? This remarkable achievement in education is a testament to the country's commitment to knowledge and learning. I hope you find this tidbit interesting, and I promise to make it up to you in our next session.

This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
14/09/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*

10/10/23, 3:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
