You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

17/08/23, 3:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Whitney, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU over *mail* in over 300-500 words. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey. Share it with me (saloni.edoofa@gmail.com) and Ms. Deepali (deepali@edoofa.com)

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call and acknowledgment of your parents on the same.

Once both things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
18/08/23, 4:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

Please provide the signed copy of the grant certificate with your and your parent's signature on it in case you don't have any doubts.
The deadline to do the same is today *11:00 PM IST | 07:30 PM CAT*
Please do the needful or else the grant might be revoked.
18/08/23, 4:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, please share the same.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*
10/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 340 9626: Thank you so much and also being able to adjust for us
10/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 340 9626: Hope you are doing well

This is a message from the _Academic Board of Edoofa_ regarding your absence from the scheduled EWYL Group session on Wednesday. I shared the call schedule last week, and I expected your participation. I understand that life can sometimes throw unexpected challenges, and I'd appreciate it if you could kindly share the reason for your absence during the call.

17/10/23, 12:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Whitney!

This message clearly states 'scheduled EWYL Group session on Wednesday'. It does not talk about any call.
17/10/23, 12:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did go through this message for your schedule Whitney?
17/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 340 9626: Yes i went through the schedule maam

17/10/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, this means our discussion, not any video call. But I am sure that you were not there for the same.
Can you share the reason behind that?
17/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 340 9626: Last week it was because i was attending discussions for the exams that i had from 6pm-8pm
18/10/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Whitney!
How are you?
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since you mentioned your reason for not attending the chat session on Wednesday and finding it genuine, I am now sharing with you the task that was shared and that will _mark your attendance for the month of October_📆
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
18/10/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

08/12/23, 4:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
08/12/23, 4:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 9 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
08/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 340 9626: Ma’am i am very skeptical about the webinar numbers i am said to have attended because i have attended all of them the last month
08/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 340 9626: I am sure the reason why I haven’t been eligible is because of the fact that i was not participating in the EWYL project which is Community building
08/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 340 9626: Which is what i am working on i am still gathering form i do have a few and will share them with you very soon
09/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 340 9626: Good afternoon
09/12/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening,

I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to request a shift in our IE Chat session from 07:00-08:00 PM due to the unavailability of students during that time. I hope you can accommodate this change.

Kindly confirm your acknowledgment at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

I am super excited🚀
09/12/23, 7:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
