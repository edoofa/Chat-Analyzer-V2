How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
29/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 340 3676: Yes
29/08/23, 9:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why are you late Melany, is everything alright at your end?
29/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 340 3676: Maybe it's the network am online
29/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, noted!

I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
29/08/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 340 3676: Thank you mam
29/08/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I'll see you on *Thursday* from 08:30-09:30 AM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 340 3676: What a rich culture. I like the latter part where brothers accept the responsibility to provide a fatherly role to sisters. In Zimbabwe   brothers take fatherly role on their sisters in future
31/08/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_
How are you?

So, I would like to share a piece of happiness that I experienced and received from my family yesterday. As I informed you yesterday we were celebrating Raksha Bandhan, let me share a glimpse of how I celebrated at my side👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

31/08/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to our discussion, well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
31/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 340 3676: Ok, am using my dad's phone,and that one is my elder sister Lindsey
31/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome them to the group, I am sure they will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in you as we move ahead in this journey🚀
31/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: So Melany, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
31/08/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
31/08/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 340 3676: l would like to take my education further when l finish my degree and my long term goal is to become an auditor and EWYL will me achieve by providing me with the necessary hands on skills .

Hope you are doing well.

I am extremely sorry for the delay, I had an urgent meeting that extended for a longer time than expected. 
But I am going to share an amazing '*_Do you know?_* shared on Edoofa's Instagram page. It is really interesting. Do go through it and let me know your answer in the comment box🤔

How was your weekend?

This week your sessions will be held on Monday, Thursday, and Friday since on Tuesday and Wednesday, we will be visiting our partner Universities. I will be sharing some amazing glimpses of those moments with you when the day arrives🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
04/09/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 340 3676: Noted, Melany went back to school yesterday.
04/09/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
04/09/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
04/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 340 3676: Noted will send it
16/09/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 340 3676: You can go ahead
21/09/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

30/09/23, 8:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Melany will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
14/10/23, 7:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Melany can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
