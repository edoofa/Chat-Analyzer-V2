I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. The icing on the cake? We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

I trust you're doing well

Our conversation on call was truly enjoyable, and I'd like to kindly remind you of the three tasks you need to complete:

📍 Please ask your *parents to confirm in this group that you've discussed the $300 plan with them*.
📍 *Share a screenshot* of the *Google review* you write for Edoofa.
📍 *share a screenshot* of the *Facebook review* you write for Edoofa.
03/10/23, 8:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
13/10/23, 1:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

I hope you are doing well

I have observed your unavailability in your EWYL Group. You have not responded to even one message which is bothersome.

I hope you understand that I take extra time out of my schedule just to check your performance and share reminders to you so that you do not miss out on any opportunity that other students are receiving by being responsive and available on a regular and timely basis. 

I hope you consider this a priority I encourage you to share your concerns transparently with me so that I can explain the objective of our interactions in the first place.

I hope you are doing well.

Since we had our call scheduled on Saturday and you got the message for the same. I would like to understand the reason behind you not being available for the call.

Also, as you must already be aware about our planned schedule for our calls and sessions that was established well in advance. Hence it is challenging to continually adjust and reschedule our timetable.

Given the fact that I don't want you to miss out on any valuable learning, I'm open to reconsidering our schedule only for this time. I *would like to reschedule our call to 6:20 pm today.*

Kindly confirm your availability for this new time?
06/11/23, 9:42 am - +91 85449 04684: I requested to  join but you didn't let me in

I'd like to kick off this session with a motivating quote by Robert Frost: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." As we gather here today, let's reflect on the path we've chosen, the journey we're on, and how it's shaping our lives.

Hope you are well.

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a *Diwali Activity*.
09/11/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

I hope you are doing well

Kindly excuse me for not getting back to me immediately. I have been under the weather for quite some long time. 
Regarding your question about medical courses, we do provide options such as B. Pharma, Bsc in Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, and more. However, we don't offer the MBBS program. This is because it requires taking an entrance exam called NEET, and only Indian residents are eligible for it. If you have any other questions or need further information, feel free to ask.
