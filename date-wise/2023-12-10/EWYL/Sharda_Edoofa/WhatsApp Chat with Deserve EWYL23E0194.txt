15/09/23, 9:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Deserve

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 400 8155: Good morning sir....

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

27/11/23, 8:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 8:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
27/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 400 8155: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 400 8155: From the document l understood that the task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to extend their helpto students under the Edoofa program.There are consideration that are put in practice on how to select the good type of companies which include nature of company,scale of company,financial stability and also the background of the Google, Instagram and crunchbase are some of the platforms that can be used to search for the information.There are 6 steps in this project which are 
 *Step 1*  : *searching* -this involves the use of links by searching on Google using words like "start up news" and for the linkedIn page there is home,about and people.
 *Step 2:*  this involves the studying of the nature of the company it's functioning and also it's purposes.
 *Step 3*  : involves the studying of the website by tapping on each tab and getting an insight into how it functions if the company functions through an app...one has to download it and study it's reviews on playstore.
 *Step 4:* it is important to check the various pages of the company such as Facebook on this stage as it gives the idea of the activities and functioning status of the company
 *Step 5* :it is important to study the background and the core members of the company on this step
 *Step 6* :this involves the reachout and passing of invitation to note and sending a connection request after checking the background of people associated with the company.The best preference is reaching out to marketing managers first as they are the heads of the departments

And all these steps help to find the right type of company
27/11/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: You know what Deserve, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
27/11/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me

*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
27/11/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Second and the fun part- I’m sure you have read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*

27/11/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
27/11/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
27/11/23, 9:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄

Here is the message -
28/11/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
28/11/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/11/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
28/11/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
28/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 400 8155: 1.Progress Christian College....yes it's connected with Edoofa already

3.Midlands province
28/11/23, 9:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
28/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 400 8155: Yes l do agree
28/11/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
28/11/23, 9:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
28/11/23, 9:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Deserve*, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
28/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 400 8155: Yess am all ready

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
28/11/23, 10:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/11/23, 10:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
