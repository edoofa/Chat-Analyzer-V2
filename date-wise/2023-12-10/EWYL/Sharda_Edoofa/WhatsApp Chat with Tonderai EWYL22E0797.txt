03/08/23, 9:17 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
03/08/23, 9:17 am - Sharda Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience.

Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.

But this affirmation is more than just words. It is a symbol of your commitment to your dreams, your passion for learning, and your desire to make a difference in the world.

22/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 73 371 5747: 2)
As the world has moved online, it puts students at an advantage to reach out to companies that are technology-driven and are digital in nature. Reaching out to these organizations on behalf of Edoofa will give studens leverage and credibility and can help them land an online live project in their country irrespective of their location. This is a direct way to contribute to theirs and their country's growth as their work will create a small but deep impact.
22/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 73 371 5747: 3)
Under this project students are expected to wear the hat of a super networker and a person who has amazing persuasion skills. Students will understand the most critical aspect of developing an Organization which is based on growing by creating social impact. This assignment will take them to youth just like them. All of them will be objectively trained on how to look into their aspirations, motivations and how to direct or channelise them to take a decision which will help them for their entire lives. For this project, edoofians will have to reach out to African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools either recently or in the past 6 months and refer them for the Edoofa program.We all become the part of team Edoofa and help this ecosystem grow.Edoofa will work with them through different stages to ensure success in this project.
22/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 73 371 5747: 4)
Students will reach out to Local Schools in their local region and will speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa.This Project is only for Senior Secondary Schools It will be a non commercial tie-up with the agenda of offering help to Senior Secondary Schools. Edoofa has taken a mission to help African Schools grow using the decade old experience of our team.Networking skills, Using professional platforms like linkedIn, Confidence, Use of Google sheets, Communication skills
22/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 73 371 5747: Okay 

Using professional networking websites like LinkedIn, building confidence, good communication skills and reaching out to people who are influential, facing rejections, fail, try, fail, try again, it gives one a  never give up attitude
22/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 73 371 5747: lol I just summed up them all

29/08/23, 4:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

I hope you are doing well.

Since we had our call scheduled on Saturday and you also acknowledged the message regarding the same. I would like to understand the reason behind you not being available for the call.

Also, as you must already be aware about our planned schedule for our calls and sessions that was established well in advance. Hence it is challenging to continually adjust and reschedule our timetable.

Given the fact that I don't want you to miss out on any valuable learning, I'm open to reconsidering our schedule only for this time. I *would like to reschedule our call to 7:00 pm today.*

Kindly confirm your availability for this new time?
06/11/23, 11:39 am - +91 86072 53645: You scheduled the call for yesterday Sunday not Saturday and no1 accepted my request to join the call yesterday which means you were not present at the time of your schedule

During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

A competitive spirit drives you to be better, deliver a higher level of performance and ultimately lifts you to be the best version of  yourself on any given day.

It helped me in my academics , i really liked maths a lot in Secondary School so in every exam that I was given i would make sure that the marks which I would score next must be better than which I had scored in the previous exams so it helped me to achieve a good grade in math during my O level exams
25/11/23, 5:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening! Your thoughtful response truly reflects a commendable attitude and work ethic. The recognition of the competitive spirit driving you to continually improve and deliver a higher level of performance is both insightful and inspiring.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!
