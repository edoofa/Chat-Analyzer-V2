01/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 998 7919: Good afternoon mentor, I'm ready for the session.
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings and a very Good Afternoon to you!
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 998 7919: Good afternoon Ms Nayak, I hope I find you well. Let's begin our session.
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you dear. How are you?
02/08/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 998 7919: I am doing well, thank you. I'm ready to start.
02/08/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
02/08/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So *Wessly*, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
03/08/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon! I hope you're doing well.
Let's begin our session
03/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon, Wessly is in his way . Hope he will be on the session soon.
03/08/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello, Good Afternoon dear parent.
How are you?
03/08/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for informing.
03/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I'm good and you
03/08/23, 2:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am doing good too. Thank you so much for asking.
03/08/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 761 2163: My long term goals include getting a leadership experience, graduating from a university, learn another language, work experience and getting an internship. EWYL Program will assist me in getting leadership experience as I will be taking orders from my leaders in doing my assignments hence this exposes me on how does a leader operate, it also helps me to be a great leader since I will be trained to be self dependent. As I will be working on my projects during my EWYL Program I interact with  many people of different cultures and languages all over the world therefore I'm more likely to learn a number of languages in order for smooth communication. EWYL Program will assist me in graduating from a university as a mechanical engineer as it paves a way for me to be an outstanding student if I do them wholeheartedly and faithfully as they require much application of what I will be learning from my lectures. Through team work and associating with different people I'm able to gain work experience as a mechanical engineer. In addition EWYL Program encourages me in pursuing masters after acquiring a degree from a university.
03/08/23, 6:42 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you, I now a have an idea about you and I would like you to know that I'm excited too to begin this journey with you. I'm also a person who enjoys interacting with different people especially those abroad from different countries

24/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 761 2163: You are welcome. 
How is your day going?
24/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Am I supposed to answer the 2 questions in the newsletter on this platform?
24/08/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is not compulsory.
24/08/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great! So have you gone through the newsletter?
24/08/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes ma'am
24/08/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you
24/08/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 761 2163: To be honesty it's also difficult for me to tell, but I would like to recommend the section of "seeking opportunities". It is filled with a lot of fruitful information that I liked and I also liked the Edoofa hall inspiration part.
24/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Yes I noticed it, one day I  also want to be celebrated on this section too.
24/08/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
24/08/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
24/08/23, 3:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

29/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

29/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.

I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
30/08/23, 11:18 am - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you for sharing with me this Indian culture, trust me I'm going to learn more about Rhaki and it's traditions. I wish you a blessed day celebrating this festival.
31/08/23, 2:52 am - +263 71 761 2163: The objective of Corporate Alliance is to gain an understanding of the market you plan to enter in the future and starting to prepare for it at an early stage. Due to global network and shift towards online work, there's is greed opportunity of connecting with technology driven and digital companies in my region. So my task is to find these companies using my immediate network,  family members, neighbors or parents of friends who work in the service sector sharing with them objectives of Edoofa and elaborate how I think Edoofa has nurtured me with necessary skills for my future employment after graduation. To connect with these companies, I can also create a Linkedin account which is a professional networking platform and allows me to search these companies. Through Linkedin I can reach to the managers and human resources managers, intiating conversations and gathering information to set up meetings with Edoofa. I will share the meeting details with Edoofa team for effective communication and discuss business aspect of this corporate Alliance.
31/08/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Scholar!

20/09/23, 2:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Wesley

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
20/09/23, 2:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
26/09/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 761 2163: Good morning how are you . I was not feeling well . And hope you are fine. I suggest sessions from 2: 00pm to 3: 00pm . Sorry for responding late.

I hope you are doing well.

Since you have mentioned the problem of network in our last few messages which I completely understand. But, I would like toremind you that if we do not meet during our scheduled session time we will miss on the learnings and access to exclusive mentorship that you get only through Edoofa.

Hence, I would like to recommend you ensure the connectivity and other concerns way before we start our mentorship sessions. 
Only then we will be able to complete the basic training on the behalf of Wessly and gain more understanding.
06/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon mentor hope you are fine

10/10/23, 4:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Wessly* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Wessly* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

20/11/23, 3:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before our session tomorrow, I want you to go through the shared audio and share your understanding of the same.

20/11/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Good afternoon Wessly*
I hope you are doing well

This is to inform you that there is a *scheduled session for you today at 1:30 pm.* Could you please confirm your availability for the same?
21/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon mentor,I'm sorry I could not make it for our session today.
21/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I observed your absence in today's session and wanted to reach out to ensure everything is alright on your end.

23/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 761 2163: The most effective way to execute this project (community building) is to create a WhatsApp group and identify right students to add. The goal is to reach out to larger number of students and provide them with necessary information about Edoofa before sessions to ensure they will  have a smooth counseling experience. To get the right students, I can get in touch with my schoolmates who are currently in form 6 or those who have passed their A level examinations. I have to ask my classmates to add me in their unofficial whatsapp group and share the link my whatsapp group with a catchy line. The next step is to share information in my group once they have joined. Before I start sharing information, I have to add my mentor first so that you can track my progress, provide guidance in learning network skills, address concerns raised by students  and discuss them accordingly and tracking what information I am sharing to the students.
23/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good afternoon dear mentor, I hope you're having a great day. I am ready for our session.
23/11/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Wessly
To ignite our spirits for today's session, let's reflect on these powerful words by Maya Angelou: 'You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.' Let's draw inspiration from these words as we embark on a journey of discovery and growth. Welcome, and let's make the most of our time together!
23/11/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: - Well Done Wessly, I am impressed with your understanding.
23/11/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
23/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

27/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I've already shared the message, but network is jot stable
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *So, we're wrapping up our session*.

27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Thank you very, I really appreciate.

28/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Good to hear that from you
28/11/23, 2:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree? 

Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 761 2163: I'm ready dear mentor, sorry for late reply
28/11/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Wessly, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*

28/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 761 2163: Noted
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
