10/08/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am great. Thank you so much
10/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 77 796 2048: You can explain to me
10/08/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
10/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 796 2048: I understand
10/08/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
10/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 796 2048: Yes I’m familiar with this objective
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful!
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
10/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 796 2048: It’s alright
10/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
10/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts
10/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 796 2048: It’s nice knowing them and I’m ready to  undertake the journey with you
10/08/23, 9:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great
10/08/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 296 9662: <Media omitted>

14/08/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
14/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 796 2048: How are you feeling now?
14/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 796 2048: Okay you can share them

14/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great
14/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
14/08/23, 9:15 am - Sharda Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience. Moreover, I am thrilled to inform you that I eagerly anticipate your arrival, as it promises to enhance the overall excitement and success of your journey. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.
14/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 796 2048: Thank you so much and I’m also thrilled that i will be there in India getting my higher quality education and also getting new skills,vision and focus.
14/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 796 2048: I’m glad that I won’t be alone on this journey
14/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Ofcourse you should be glad, and you will have your mentor and whole Edoofa with you throughout your journey.
14/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 796 2048: Yes and I appreciate it thank you

Here is the message -
23/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached.
 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
23/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 796 2048: Okay noted and I understand

29/08/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.

29/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 796 2048: Yes i an following
29/08/23, 9:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
29/08/23, 9:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
29/08/23, 9:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
29/08/23, 9:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
29/08/23, 9:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
29/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 796 2048: Yes i am ready
29/08/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Our conversation on call was truly enjoyable, and I'd like to kindly remind you of the three tasks you need to complete:

📍 Please ask your *parents to confirm in this group that you've discussed the $300 plan with them*.
📍 *Share a screenshot* of the *Google review* you write for Edoofa.
📍 *share a screenshot* of the *Facebook review* you write for Edoofa.
03/10/23, 8:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

18/10/23, 4:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.

To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 

*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*

09/12/23, 2:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
09/12/23, 2:33 pm - +91 92893 22542: How are you Ms.Sharda
09/12/23, 2:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am good, thank you so much for asking.
09/12/23, 2:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.

09/12/23, 7:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,

Team EWYL
