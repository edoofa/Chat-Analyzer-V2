29/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 418 4588: What happens next after l get a student to fill in the form
29/08/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: okay I am telling you now.
29/08/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
29/08/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
29/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 418 4588: I understand that creating a wats app group for identification of potential students is a easy way of reaching out to large numbers of students
The group will include upper six students and those who have already completed their senior secondary School
I will be sharing information regarding the EDOOFA SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM   . I understand that you will also be part of the group for progress checking
29/08/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Nancy, I am impressed with your understanding.
29/08/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
29/08/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
29/08/23, 3:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
29/08/23, 3:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 3:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is how you have to make sure that the application form is filled
29/08/23, 3:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 3:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
29/08/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is very valuable information that you can definitely use while communicating with the students. Do you agree?
29/08/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 418 4588: I agree and understand
29/08/23, 4:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 


Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.


I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
29/08/23, 4:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Q2  Greetings estimated educators .My name is Tendai Nancy Nyoni a proud Edoofian, here to share with you an opportunity of a lifetime that the Edoofa scholarships program offers for hardworking students to achieve their dreams to study abroad at  affordable costs.
Q3 Midlands province
31/08/23, 3:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
31/08/23, 3:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:

Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
31/08/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
31/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 418 4588: I agree
31/08/23, 3:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
31/08/23, 3:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
31/08/23, 3:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
31/08/23, 3:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],

I am writing to you as a proud beneficiary of the esteemed _Edoofa Scholarship Program_ and I feel privileged to have the opportunity to connect with you today.

I am thrilled to share with you that I have been selected to pursue my higher education in India through the Edoofa Scholarship Program. This incredible opportunity allows me to fulfill my dream of receiving a quality education at an affordable price. Not only will I gain knowledge in my chosen field of study, but I will also acquire valuable skills that will set me apart in today's competitive world and increase my employability.
*I firmly believe that students at your esteemed institution should also have access to such life-changing opportunities. Together, we can empower our students to realize their dreams and equip them with the tools needed for a successful and fulfilling future*

01/09/23, 3:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would like to inform you that we are ready to begin our new journey.

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*

*SECOND*- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.

Edoofa EWYL (contact):  *+91 98107 89170*

*FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, *Ms. Sharda*, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

*FIFTH*- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
01/09/23, 3:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
04/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 418 4588: Good day ma'am

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
09/11/23, 12:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would like to let you know that *we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali,* a significant Indian festival.🪔
