Thank you for sharing this.

29/09/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and *Chido*

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
29/09/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
29/09/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 314 5357: I opt for the 2 PM to 3 pm slot since I will have less pressure at work
29/09/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 314 5357: I am the father to Chido
29/09/23, 9:08 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon sir
I hope you are doing well

Looking forward to our session today.
29/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 314 5357: Fine
29/09/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 314 5357: My day is ok
29/09/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Name, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Sharda Nayak* and I am  Chido's *EWYL mentor*
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Great Ms Sharda
29/09/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am thrilled to be *Chido*'s  mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for Chido's application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about from her counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of  her application, particularly  her  desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
29/09/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be Chido's mentor, guide, and a friend throughout the journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are she  is in India. 
Let me share something about myself through this video so that you can be rest assured that your child is in responsible hands …
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
29/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Waiting for the video

03/10/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Chido
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
03/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Sorry for seeing your message late
03/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am free
03/10/23, 3:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
03/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Would be greatful to learn of them
03/10/23, 4:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Chido* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
03/10/23, 4:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since you have joined the session late, there is an urgent meeting that I have to attend today.
Let us connect tomorrow at our scheduled time.
03/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Noted Ms Sharda

05/10/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Chido is at school she did not carry her Fon for they are not allowed at their school
05/10/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

05/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Fine
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Oh that's great.
05/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I don't know if Chido has earned any credits this far since she once undertook tasks to market Edoofa to some schools in Manicaland

06/10/23, 3:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Let me check it
06/10/23, 3:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *Chido* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.




If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,

06/10/23, 3:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: May I know what the challenge is with the email?

06/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am not near WiFi for now so that would call for me to buy a data bundle, which at the time of writing, am not able to buy.

In such a scenario, I would want you to send the email by today 8:00pm.
Can it be possible?

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

26/10/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Greetings Ms Sharda. Let me set the record straight once again. The policy in most Zimbabwean boarding schools is that cellphones are regarded as a distraction to learning.  As such, Chido , being a boarder student, does not have access to her cellphone until she comes for holiday upon completion of her exams. She left her phone home with us. Therefore she is sidelined from all the activities that take place on the various Whatsapp platforms. 
Good afternoon
26/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 314 5357: I am the father to Chido
26/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Unless you specifically have a request that I undertake particular tasks for Chido during her absence I am ready to do so. 
Hoping to hear from you
26/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon sir,
Thank you for sharing the details and I also understand the rules of the boarding schools. 
I was just wondering if everything is going good at your end.

No, nothing is compulsory as of now. But, I want to make sure Chido is satying connected with the EWYL Mentors hence I shared an interesting information about Dussehra.
26/10/23, 3:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I will try my best that we are connected even once a week, until Chido's examinations get over.
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 314 5357: My pleasure Ms Sharda. To prove my commitment towards Chido's education, I  made a US$350 part payment yesterday for her admission fees for 2024 under the early registration facility, leaving a balance of US$250. So far she got an offer from Galgotias University and I hope more will come in the near future.
26/10/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Congratulations for this. Chido already has an offer from a university. This is huge.
And parents like you are an inspiration who put in all their efforts to make sure their children get the best in their lives.
26/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Of course I value her tomorrow hence the sacrifices
26/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 314 5357: With you mentoring us  all the way it would be unfair not to acknowledge your invaluable contribution you continuously make . Thumbs up.
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words! It's been a true pleasure and privilege to mentor and support Chido. Your appreciation means a lot, and I'm here to continue helping her in any way I can.
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Thanks once again Ms Sharda. Enjoy the rest of your day
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I wish you the same.
31/10/23, 5:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Chido

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

31/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Chido likes sports particularly volleyball. I would like to believe she would also be pleased to be part of cultural events for they allow exchange of ideas,  since Indian universities serve as multicultural communities
31/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Taking cognisant of the fact that students come from across the globe, I can't stop imagining how Chido will gel into such a community for it will make her ready to adapt to a plethora of heterozygous environments owing to cross pollination of ideas.

I hope you are doing well

That's great to hear that Chido is interested in sports, especially volleyball. It's a fantastic team sport that can be both fun and competitive. 
And I completely agree with your perspective on cultural events. Indian universities do indeed serve as multicultural communities, and participating in cultural events can be a wonderful way to learn from and connect with people from various backgrounds.
01/11/23, 12:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It's clear that you have a forward-thinking and open-minded perspective on Chido's experience in an international student community. You're absolutely right; such diverse environments foster cross-cultural exchanges and help individuals adapt to a variety of situations, which is a valuable life skill.
01/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Good afternoon Ms Sharda.
01/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Great to connect with you. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on my views

07/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 314 5357: Greetings Ms Sharda. Thanks for sharing such information.  Exams are ongoing. I will share the news with Chido once she returns
07/11/23, 2:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay dear parent!

07/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
09/11/23, 10:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning

Here is the message -
29/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

30/11/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
30/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 008 3552: Yes I'm ready

30/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
30/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
30/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

*Kindly excuse me for any inconvenience. I'd like to inform you that I encountered a technical glitch due to which last week's activity was shared again with you. I appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter.*

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!
