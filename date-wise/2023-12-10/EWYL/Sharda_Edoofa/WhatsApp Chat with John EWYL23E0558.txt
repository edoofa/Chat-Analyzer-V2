1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 


This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

02/12/23, 1:24 pm - +260 771923158: Community building: Community building is the process of bringing people together to create a sense of belonging and connection within a specific group or locality. It involves fostering relationships, promoting collaboration, and creating a supportive environment where individuals can engage, share ideas, and work towards common goals. Community building can take place in various settings, such as neighborhoods, schools, online platforms, or even within organizations. It's all about nurturing a sense of community and building strong bonds among its members. When it comes to targeting specific organizations for community building, it depends on your interests and the type of community you want to build. You can start by identifying organizations or groups that align with your goals and values, and reach out to them to explore potential partnerships or collaborations. Remember, community building is all about building relationships and working together towards a shared purpose. It’s primarily achievement is that we must develop networking and learn how to give opportunities to other people to join edoofa so they should be helped in their lifetime, this project encourages people to identify other communities and create their community experiences through the use of social networking platforms such as social media and social networks. It also helps students to be able to engage into scholarship and have credits.

07/12/23, 2:54 pm - +260 771923158: Emmanuel Adventist secondary school, yes it is connected with edoofa.

07/12/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
07/12/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
07/12/23, 3:11 pm - +260 771923158: I agree

07/12/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
07/12/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
07/12/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
