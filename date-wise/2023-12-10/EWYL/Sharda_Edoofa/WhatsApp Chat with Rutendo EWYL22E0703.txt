19/08/23, 9:48 am - +91 90419 69960: I got classes from 9-5 everyday and on Saturday as well....so I'm literally at school right now
19/08/23, 9:49 am - +91 90419 69960: It is very exhausting

Consider researching local deals, discounts, and affordable options for daily expenses. Avoid unnecessary splurges and focus on experiences that truly matter to you.

kindly complete the following tasks as soon as possible. These are some interesting yet very less time taking tasks - 

📍 *A photo of you in your college* :

📍 *Facebook Username* :

📍 *Instagram Username*
📍 *Date of birth* -
03/10/23, 8:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

04/10/23, 11:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Rutendo
I hope you are doing well

I would like to remind you that you have not shared your photo in college.
Kindly send that within 15 minutes. Its Importnat.
10/10/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

I genuinely appreciate your honesty, and I completely understand the situation. Let's put any past issues behind us. Moving forward, I kindly invite you to join and actively participate in our scheduled sessions, where we can make the most of our time together. I want to emphasize that in the college setting, effective multitasking is key, and dedicating just 20-30 minutes twice a month won't have any  impact on your academic progress. Your active participation will greatly benefit our shared objectives.
13/10/23, 1:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

A gentle reminder to join the scheduled call at *1:30PM today*

Here's the link - https://meet.google.com/dco-gkkn-pex
21/10/23, 10:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon Rutendo, It was lovely talking to you. I am sure that you have understood each and everything clearly. Let me brief the call for you- 

*1. From now onwards, you will get 300$ for Community building.*
If a student pays enrollment fees (200$) - You will get 75$
When the student pays the remaining 100$ -  You will get 25$
When a student pays the Registration fee (School fees) - You will get 100$
When a student comes to India - You will get 100$
21/10/23, 10:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: *2. You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
23/10/23, 9:56 am - +91 90419 69960: Good afternoon Ms. Sharda. I hope you're doing well
23/10/23, 9:57 am - +91 90419 69960: I need to get clarity....the other time you sent me a message saying I'd get I think 25 dollars I don't remember....let me check
23/10/23, 9:58 am - +91 90419 69960: This message ....is it the same community building stuff or it's different?
23/10/23, 9:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Rutendo
I hope you are doing well.

I can completely understand the query, let me clarify it for you.
23/10/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: This is the same message.
After  you have come to India, we have revised the plan to $300.
So, instead of $25, now you will get $300.
23/10/23, 10:04 am - +91 90419 69960: Okay Ms. Sharda.
23/10/23, 10:05 am - +91 90419 69960: So this 300 goes towards my tuition?
23/10/23, 10:07 am - +91 90419 69960: However I do have a challenge regarding the community building project..
..I lost contact with the people I used to talk to back in Zimbabwe. Is there any alternate plan you can help me with?
23/10/23, 10:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Rutendo,
In such a scenario I would suggest you connect with your parents and seek their help who can help you connect with their friend's kids.
Another way is you can connect with few of your school teachers, or school friends and even your siblings and cousins.

This way, you will be able to get the contacts of new people yet again.
23/10/23, 11:03 am - +91 90419 69960: I have tried asking my parents , siblings and cousins.....so far nothing feasible has come out of it.
23/10/23, 11:04 am - +91 90419 69960: As for my friends and teachers that's the part where I'm saying I lost contacts which I hadn't memorised after my phone got reset
23/10/23, 11:05 am - +91 90419 69960: So Ms. Sharda , the same plan is applicable with the African schools community?
23/10/23, 2:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: No, it is not so.
23/10/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is only for the Community Building project.
23/10/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/10/23, 2:48 pm - +91 90419 69960: Okay okay
23/10/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings!☺️

I hope you consider this a priority and share your video latest by tomorrow. If you feel that this task is not important, I encourage you to share your concerns transparently with me so that I can explain the objective of it in the first place.
