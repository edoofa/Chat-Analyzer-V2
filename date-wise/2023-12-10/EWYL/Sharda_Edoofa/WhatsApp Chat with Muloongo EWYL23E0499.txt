17/08/23, 8:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning, *Esteemed Learner!*
How are you?

It's an honor to have such dedicated students join me for this scheduled session.
Are you ready for it?
17/08/23, 8:35 am - +260 770170108: Yes I’m ready
17/08/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful muloongo
17/08/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
17/08/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
17/08/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts
17/08/23, 8:50 am - +260 770170108: I’m glad to hear about them 
Thank you for the splendid introduction
17/08/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
17/08/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
17/08/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨

2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
17/08/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: How does that sound, *Muloongo*?
17/08/23, 9:01 am - +260 770170108: That sounds really great
17/08/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
17/08/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience. Moreover, I am thrilled to inform you that I eagerly anticipate your arrival, as it promises to enhance the overall excitement and success of your journey. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.
17/08/23, 9:17 am - +260 770170108: I understand
17/08/23, 9:18 am - +260 770170108: Thank you very much
17/08/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: Imagine that you are a wizard, and you possess a magical spell that can transform your life and empower you to achieve your dreams. This spell is simple yet powerful, and all you have to do is recite a few words every day. By chanting "I am a proud Edoofian" on the EWYL group, you will activate this spell and unlock a world of possibilities.
17/08/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: As an Edoofian, you are part of a special community of people who share a common goal - to achieve success and advance in life. By repeating this affirmation every day, you are reminding yourself of your purpose, your mission, and your identity as an ambitious and driven individual. You are telling the universe that you are proud of who you are, and that you are ready to take on any challenge that comes your way.
But this affirmation is more than just words. It is a symbol of your commitment to your dreams, your passion for learning, and your desire to make a difference in the world. It is a way to connect with your fellow Edoofians, to share your struggles and your triumphs, and to support each other on your journey to success.
17/08/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: So every day, when you recite these words, feel the power and the magic that they contain. Visualize yourself as a proud Edoofian, standing tall and strong, with the world at your feet. Let this affirmation fill you with confidence, hope, and with the knowledge that you are part of something special. And watch as your life transforms before your eyes, as you become the best version of yourself, and as you achieve everything you have ever wanted.
17/08/23, 9:27 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Thank you all for your active participation today. Looking forward to our next insightful session!*

24/08/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Muloongo, I am impressed with your understanding.
24/08/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
24/08/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
24/08/23, 9:10 am - +260 770170108: Thank you
24/08/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

24/08/23, 9:50 am - +260 770170108: I have a question
24/08/23, 9:52 am - +260 770170108: Is it okay for me to talk to the principal or headmaster over the phone without visiting them and explain to them about the Edoofa program without visiting them physically??
24/08/23, 9:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes yes it is completely alright.
24/08/23, 9:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: But, before that you can drop a text to them which will look for formal.
24/08/23, 9:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
24/08/23, 9:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
24/08/23, 9:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:
24/08/23, 9:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
24/08/23, 9:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:
24/08/23, 9:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
24/08/23, 9:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
24/08/23, 10:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: School Group < 100
24/08/23, 10:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
24/08/23, 10:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
24/08/23, 10:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: How to excel in the project?
24/08/23, 10:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: SET 1:
24/08/23, 10:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since you are facing challenges connecting with Headmasters, what we can do is:

1) I can share some contact details with you of those Schools that were earlier not responsive to us with whom you can establish a connection again

2) You can try searching for schools on Google

-Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results. 

So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.

3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.

4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.

31/10/23, 4:57 pm - +260 770170108: 1. Internships can help you develop the skills and knowledge that employers are looking for. When you intern at a company, you have the opportunity to learn from experienced professionals and gain hands-on experience with the tools and technologies that are used in the industry. This can give you a significant advantage over other job candidates who do not have any practical experience.

2. Internships can help you build your network of professional contacts. While you are interning, you will have the opportunity to meet and interact with people from all levels of the company. These contacts can be valuable resources for you as you progress your career. For example, they may be able to provide you with job leads, references, or advice.

3. Internships can help you confirm your career path or make a change. If you are not sure what career path you want to pursue, an internship can be a great way to explore different options. Or, if you are looking to make a career change, an internship can help you gain the skills and experience you need to be successful in your new field.

4. Internships can lead to full-time job offers. Many companies offer internships to students and recent graduates with the intention of hiring them full-time after they graduate. In fact, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), 70.7% of employers who hire interns offer them full-time jobs after graduation.
31/10/23, 5:06 pm - +260 770170108: The lessons I have learnt from Mr Ian’s talk regarding the development of a professional online presence that doesn’t explicitly inquire about the significance of maintaining a positive online image is one needs to ; 

1. Be visible and active: The more visible and active you are online, the more likely people are to notice you and learn about your work. Make sure you have a presence on the social media platforms that are relevant to your industry and target audience. Share your thoughts and insights on industry news and trends, and engage with other professionals in your field.

2. Create valuable content: One of the best ways to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry is to create and share valuable content. This could include blog posts, articles, white papers, e-books, or podcasts.

3. Build relationships: Networking is essential for career success, and online networking is a great way to connect with professionals from all over the world. Follow people you admire, comment on their posts, and reach out to them directly. 

4. Be authentic: People can spot a fake from a mile away, so be yourself and let your personality shine through in your online presence. Share your passions and interests, and be honest about your expertise and experience. The more authentic you are, the more people will connect with you.

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
09/12/23, 1:34 pm - +260 770170108: Greetings Ms Sharda
09/12/23, 1:35 pm - +260 770170108: An echo
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, that is correct.
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - +260 770170108: Yes
