13/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

Hope you are well.

I apologize for not being able to take your session due to a prior commitment to address a personal matter.
Thank you for understanding.
19/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon mam l understand.

19/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm ready mam
19/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
19/09/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I can't remember the objectives.May you highlight again
19/09/23, 3:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/09/23, 3:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you mam lm happy to work with them.
20/09/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 412 4684: As of now Precious is at school and has no phone as they are not allowed to have them
20/09/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I know that and this is for her future reference when she comes back as then you will be able to convey this to her.

21/09/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
21/09/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Precious forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
21/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 412 4684: It's ok
21/09/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
21/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for Precious's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that her academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure she is given enough opportunities to self-finance her higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you mam may God grand you wisdom
21/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you @263774124684
21/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Precious will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
21/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you mam l will get back to you

22/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Precious can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things she is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make the mentor trust the student fully
22/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you

Hope you are well.

Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.
02/11/23, 4:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
