22/09/23, 10:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know Trevor is in school. I definitely want Trevor to not compromise on his studies and give his best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
22/09/23, 10:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

25/09/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be his mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for his application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback from his counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of his application, particularly his desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
25/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 110 4583: That's okay, good to know you Ms Aditi
25/09/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be his mentor, guide, and a friend throughout the journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are he is in India.

25/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?

27/09/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great! @263781104583 I would request you to be on time for the sessions from tomorrow as I have a very tight schedule.
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Alright, I will try my best, I'm also student so I might be in class at that time
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 110 4583: My timetable changes
27/09/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.

28/09/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon.
I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
28/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Goof afternoon yes
28/09/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/09/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming from here let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Trevor is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
28/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 110 4583: That's okay, understood
28/09/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
28/09/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
28/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Thats okay, its great knowing them
28/09/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Trevor* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
28/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Alright, understood
28/09/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Trevor* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
28/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
29/09/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 808 0742: Mukuru: Hi LLOYD TAPFUMA, Shorwi collected Ordr:108976457 and got their $100 in CASH! Have a great day and tell your friends.
29/09/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
29/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Im doing great and yourself?
29/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Thats okay I'm ready
29/09/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
29/09/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Trevor*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure he is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Well noted with thanks
29/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Trevor* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
29/09/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Okay
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Trevor* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Trevor* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully. <This message was edited>
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Okay, understood
29/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. 
Either you can make the decision on behalf of *Trevor*, or he can be active for a few minutes in the session tomorrow and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once he is back from school.
29/09/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Please choose a batch for the sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
29/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 110 4583: I wait for him so that he can choose
29/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted.
29/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once he is back, he is supposed to note a few things.

-In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.

-All the conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line. <This message was edited>
29/09/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session ends at this point.
Please be aware that there are no planned meetings on Saturday and Sunday.

Our following meeting is scheduled for *Tuesday* as on Monday on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary also known as  India's Father is revered worldwide for his tireless efforts in promoting non-violence and independence.

I hope you have a fantastic weekend ahead!🌺
03/10/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!

03/10/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Whenever Trevor comes back he has to connect with me over here and introduce himself with his name and EWYL group name.
03/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Okay
03/10/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Trevor has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Okay you can go on
03/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where he learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, he was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 110 4583: Okay, understood
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, he will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help Trevor to fund your higher education. The Mentor will be involved with the student at every step and will be guiding the way throughout the journey. The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build his personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Note: The EWYL mentor will not be addressing the admission queries
03/10/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
03/10/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! This is it from my side for today. So we will resume our session tomorrow in the allotted time slot.
