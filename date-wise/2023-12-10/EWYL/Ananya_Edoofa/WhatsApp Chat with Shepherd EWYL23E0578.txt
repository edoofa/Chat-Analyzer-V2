I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:

Kindly excuse me fro the delay, I was attending an important meeting with the head of our department.
21/10/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
21/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 524 3459: Ok madam thank you for connecting
21/10/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
21/10/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 524 3459: My name is Shepherd Chokuwa. I come from Zimbabwe .I am 18 years old and I am interested in music. I am talented in music especially singing and playing pianos. I am a person who is very patient and passion. I am also a confident person and I can also consider my self as a hard-working person and someone who can face any challenge and overcome.
21/10/23, 9:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Nice to meet you. It's awesome that you're into music, especially singing and playing the piano. Sounds like you've got some serious talent there! Being patient, passionate, confident, and hardworking are all great qualities, and they'll definitely serve you well in pursuing your musical dreams. Keep that determination going, and you'll overcome any challenge that comes your way. Rock on! 🎵🎹🎤
21/10/23, 9:45 am - +263 78 524 3459: Thank you so much Ms Ananya. I really appreciate your inspirations
21/10/23, 9:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/10/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 524 3459: No I don't understand. I would be glad if you can explain.
21/10/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
21/10/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
21/10/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 524 3459: Ok ok I understand madam thank you so much for explaining
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/10/23, 10:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 524 3459: I am through madam thank you
21/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
21/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here! I would suggest that you read the document and share your understanding with me on Monday!

I'll be away from 10th to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

I hope you are doing well. I want to highlight that, despite constant reminders and messages, you have crossed the deadline for completing your orientation with me.

Please remember that you signed a document committing to finishing your orientation program with me to proceed with your scholarship procedures.

Today being the last day, it would be great if we could either connect today or schedule our session for the day. This way, I can ensure a hassle-free and progressive journey for you.
20/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mrs Ananya I am sorry for not connecting. I had been finishing the exams and I am glad to let you know that the exams have come to an end. I also faced another challenge of a phone break up but I am glad to be back to you and I hope that I will be available regularly for all the sessions thank you
20/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Shepherd, I understand that however, you could have informed me earlier about this, and I could helped you with a fast track process.
20/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 78 524 3459: I am sorry for that madam but from today onwards I am sure that I will be available all the sessions madam
20/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
20/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 524 3459: Yes I am clear with that. Thank you so much
20/11/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.

21/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mrs Ananya. I am glad to connect with you this morning and I hope you are doing well.
21/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 524 3459: According to my understanding the EWYL program is a very good and best program. According to my analysis I found out that the EWYL helps students to benefit to a greater extend by getting in touch with different organisations that may help in employments as soon as a student finish the course in India. Particularly I also realized that the program reduces the costs of the fees required by allowing students to earn scholarship credits. I also noticed that the EWYL helps according to the efforts and hardworking of a student.
21/11/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning! 🚀

23/11/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I have a small quiz for you.
I am sharing details of a few companies below. Please tell me which companies fulfill the criteria we discussed above and which do not, okay?

I was hoping to hear from you at our scheduled time, how are you today?
24/11/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 975 0801: Good morning Mrs Ananya. I am glad to connect with you this morning. Thank you so much
24/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 975 0801: Regarding this according to my understanding the second company is the one that concurs with the criteria we have discussed. From the first fact, the description of the first one does not fully explain and so does the third one, it's name and the description does not Tally well. But for the second one it's name and description concurs and it fully explain and it gives opportunities to students
24/11/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.
And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
24/11/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok I got you madam thank you for enlightening me
24/11/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Shepherd, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
24/11/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok madam
24/11/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you are done with the audio, I would want you to very quickly summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
24/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok
24/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok madam I understood that this project is the community building on which a student must reach out to friends and so many other students likely who have finished A level and those who are still writing exams. The student must share with them the news about edoofa and the lovely mentors and counselors of this program. Sharing about the expenses and everything regarding edoofa. The student must also ask the friends to fill the offline forms with their details and share with the mentors. The student must link with the serious students.
24/11/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome Shepherd, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

27/11/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Shepherd!

Did you know that India and Africa share a rich history of diplomatic and trade relations that dates back centuries? The strong bond between these two regions has been further strengthened in recent years through collaborative efforts in various sectors, including trade, infrastructure, and technology.
27/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 975 0801: Morning ma'am. Yes I have learned about that at school.
27/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's great, Shepherd!
27/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok madam thank you so much
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

Subject Combination in A Level:-History Sociology FRS
Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6) :L5 

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-2024

Preferred year of Admission:- August 2025
28/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes!
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
28/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

After all the student must share the contact details of the principal with the ewyl mentor.
28/11/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?

04/12/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 524 3459: Ok ma'am I was saying so because at the moment I had lost so many contacts during the time my phone was stolen so I changed the phone of which so far I just have 2 contacts of the students but now they are not online but I promise that as soon as they get online I will share the contact with you ma'am
04/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝

Let us begin our today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 975 0801: Good morning Mrs Ananya. I am sorry I may fail to connect with you today as well as yesterday.  I am at a conference and my available time today is may be only 1900. Thank you. And the conference is going to end tommorow morning so I will connect regularly

06/12/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 975 0801: It's a conference regarding human rights and responsibilities madam

06/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 975 0801: No madam there are just adults and I attended as an Asher
06/12/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's great! Well, I have an idea, you can discuss your Edoofa Scholarship Program and even share your group link. What do you think?
06/12/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok madam I am going to do the same and share the link. That's a great idea madam
06/12/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great!
06/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday  and Thursday -  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
06/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
06/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
06/12/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok madam I understand.
