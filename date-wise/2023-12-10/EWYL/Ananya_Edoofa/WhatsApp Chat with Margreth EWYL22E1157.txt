22/08/23, 2:34 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
22/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 624 8291: Yes
22/08/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
22/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 624 8291: Ok
22/08/23, 2:38 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
22/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 624 8291: In what ways is it different from the EWYL
22/08/23, 2:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: Both are earned by you. Now it is up to you how you utilize it.
22/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 624 8291: Ok
22/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 624 8291: Please share more information, if we are still going on with the session
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - +91 78273 08969: You will know more as we go with the session.
22/08/23, 2:50 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
22/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 624 8291: Yes
22/08/23, 2:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
22/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 624 8291: It's encouraging
22/08/23, 2:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 624 8291: We cherish your continued support and guidance /mentorship
22/08/23, 3:02 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride.

With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

Some examples include communicating new ideas, feelings or even an update on your project. I have also learned that Communication skills involve listening, speaking, observing and empathising.

01/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.

Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.

Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.

Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.

01/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step  "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
01/11/23, 4:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude today's session here. In the next session, we will be discussing this Eligibility check.

As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. I would like you to frame 4-5 questions for yourself by this weekend. I will read them and approve them!

08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 89688 10387: Okay
15/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
15/11/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was expecting a response from your end, but since our session time is over, I am concluding today's session h

I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am curious to understand the reason behind your absence from the session today.

It's just that we connect only once a week, and that too late in the evening after all your classes. Even after that, you are not attending your sessions; it's an alarming situation for me and I want to know the reason so that I can help you with that.
