04/09/23, 4:19 pm - +91 76819 66443: *Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed faculty, and my fellow Edoofians,* 

I stand before you today with immense pride and gratitude. My name is *Nkosilathi Kelvin Kaseke*, and I am a Proud Edoofian. 
It's an honor to address you on this Orientation Day, a day that marks the beginning of your academic adventure in *Lovely Professional University, here in India.* 

I vividly recall the moment when I first embarked on this remarkable journey through the Edoofa Scholarship Program. It was an opportunity that seemed too good to be true, a chance *to pursue higher education in India* at a prestigious institution like *Lovely Professional University.* 

From the very beginning, Edoofa stood by my side. They guided me through the entire process, from understanding what India had to offer to connecting me with like minded individuals. I arrived in a foreign land, but *Edoofa made it feel like home.* 

Today, I find myself in my second year of *BTech Mechanical Engineering,* and the journey so far has been nothing short of incredible. 

Many of you may already know me, as I've had the privilege of assisting some of you *in finding accommodation* when you arrived in this beautiful country. This *sense of community, is one of the many treasures that Edoofa brings* into our lives.

My message to all of you, my fellow edoofians, is simple: *seize every opportunity that Edoofa offers you.* *Lovely Professional University* is a prestigious institution, and it's here that you'll find *numerous chances to excel.* I encourage you to grab those opportunities, to *strive for excellence,* and to *collect as many certifications as possible.* 
These *achievements will definitely set you apart in the competitive job market.* 

I must emphasize the *invaluable role* that our Edoofa mentors play. The *Wednesday lessons and Saturday activities are golden opportunities* to learn about the real world, gain insights, and develop essential skills.
My mentors have really played an *instrumental role in my journey* up to now. 
 *The Earn While You Learn Program* has not only *eased the financial burden* but also taught me the *value of hard work and mentorship.* 

I remember my mentor's advice regarding the Earn While You Learn Program. He always said: " *The more you connect with your mentor, the more scholarship credits you earn."* This directly means that, Your mentor is *your guide, your source of advice, and your gateway to new opportunities.* 

I want to express my gratitude to *Mr. Rithvik*, my former mentor, for his unwavering support and I am equally appreciative of my current mentor, *Ms. Jasmine,* for her guidance and encouragement.

In conclusion, my fellow Edoofians, let us remember that our journey has just begun. 
Embrace the challenges, *learn from the experiences,* and *aspire to make a difference not only in your own lives* but also in the *lives of those around you.* 
Edoofa has given us a platform, and it's our responsibility *to make the most of it.* 

I'm grateful, and Above all, I'm wishing you all the best in your future endeavours, my fellow edoofians ✨

Yours, *Kelvin*

03/10/23, 8:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Morning Kelvin_*, 
I hope you are doing great. I would like to apologize for the delayed response, which was due to the national holiday observed on October 2, 2023, in honor of Gandhi Jayanti. As a result, our office was closed, and I appreciate your understanding in this matter.
03/10/23, 8:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well Kelvin. How are you doing?
03/10/23, 8:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, I really want to say that it is great that you are paying so much attention to the details of the forms. Well done Kelvin. The only thing that we both need to work on is the number of enrollments and this can only happen when students are very well educated beforehand.
03/10/23, 10:35 am - +91 76819 66443: Alright, I have duly noted that mam 😊

I trust your weekend was enjoyable. 🌞
Kelvin are you aware of the  incredible achievement of Felix Baumgartner, who leaped from the fringes of space and safely landed in New Mexico? It's a remarkable testament to human bravery and our unquenchable thirst for exploration

11/10/23, 10:55 am - +91 76819 66443: Yes I had a wonderful weekend Mam, I hope you enjoyed yours too

Truly speaking, among all other fields of study and career, Space science fascinates me to a greater extent Mam and I am willing to take a step into that field if everything goes well😊
11/10/23, 12:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, very well Kelvin. I would suggest you watch his video on YouTube, I am sure you will be amazed. Let me share the link
11/10/23, 12:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: https://youtu.be/Hz2F_S3Tl0Y?si=Txf3vHNvJhrXpDE8
11/10/23, 12:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kelvin, there's a student named *Ndapiwa Mlambo*, who is pursuing a B.Sc in Agriculture at LPU. Could you help me in finding his contact information? I've been attempting to reach out to him for the past few days, but it seems that he may have changed his phone number.
11/10/23, 12:30 pm - +91 76819 66443: Thank you so much for sharing, Ms. Jasmine
11/10/23, 12:32 pm - +91 76819 66443: Okay Mam

12/10/23, 8:01 am - +91 76819 66443: Mam, a number of students from the previous application forms are saying they haven't been reached out to, yet. May you kindly assist me 😊
12/10/23, 8:01 am - +91 76819 66443: Oh, okay Mam, let me look for his new number then
12/10/23, 8:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Kelvin, these student applications, as we were approaching the closing of applications for 2023, our team had been diligently focusing on a selective number of applications to ensure thorough evaluation of the students who were found eligible for the program. This inadvertently led to a certain number of applications, including yours, being scheduled slightly later than others.
12/10/23, 8:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: To update you on the forms that are yet to be contacted, our counseling team will be reaching out to your students within the next 7 days.
12/10/23, 8:23 am - +91 76819 66443: Alright no worries, I understand 😊

13/10/23, 5:00 pm - +91 76819 66443: Thank you so much Mam, It was an educative one, and I have learnt tangile information on Content writing and Plagiarism.
Starting from the types of plagiarism which include direct plagiarism, self plagiarism as well and patchwork plagiarism to the various ways by which we can prevent plagiarism. 

A larger portion of the audience was worried about self plagiarism, and I also asked a question regarding the different approaches that a dedicated content writer can prevent self plagiarism while working on many platforms or projects. I'm glad that I have been answered and I'm left with no doubt 😊

Thank you so much mam, I'm looking forward to many more educative webinars ✨💫

I trust you are doing well. I'm delighted to learn that you've been dedicating your time to educating students. Could you please share the topics and subjects you've been addressing with the students?
08/11/23, 7:15 pm - +91 76819 66443: Okay mam, I have been starting by introducing the Edoofa Scholarship Program to the students as well as sharing Edoofa's Vision approach towards making Quality International Education accessible, affordable and employment oriented. 
I also explained the activities carried out under the Edoofa and SEELS program and how they benefit the Edoofians. most importantly, I explained the Edoofa Cycle in detail to provide the students with a clear roadmap of what processes they will be going to get through.
08/11/23, 7:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great Kelvin. I am sharing one document with you.

09/11/23, 2:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Regarding Step 3, your task is to create five simple questions that you can ask your students. You can refer to the training document for assistance. Is this clear to you?
09/11/23, 2:32 pm - +91 76819 66443: Yes sure, it is clear. I understood that I should check the student's eligibility before submitting the form by asking them questions about what I would have educated them.
09/11/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, You can start working on this after the session and make sure you submit the questions by tomorrow.
09/11/23, 2:32 pm - +91 76819 66443: Mam, how is the training going to be conducted?
09/11/23, 2:33 pm - +91 76819 66443: Okay Mam
09/11/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will be asking you to share the screenshots with me of the conversations that you are having with the students and the questions that you are asking to check whether they have understood or not.
09/11/23, 2:35 pm - +91 76819 66443: Okay ok, noted Mam
09/11/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's discuss the essential information that you should convey to the students:
09/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 76819 66443: Sure, I'm ready 😊

3) What are the *average costs per year in India after the Edoofa Scholarship's Fund* ?
