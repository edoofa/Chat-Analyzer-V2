*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 3:57 pm - +91 75081 21739: Okay ma'am well understood
17/08/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you have any questions?
17/08/23, 4:01 pm - +91 75081 21739: So far everything is clear
17/08/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant.

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.

30/11/23, 2:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 75081 21739: As fo the EWYL group sessions and EWYL call I can accomplish that, and as for  the video, probably I will do it in the month of December and submit it. As for the forms I might have some difficulties but I will put more effort
30/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 75081 21739: All clear ma'am
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 75081 21739: Thank you ma'am, I will pull up my socks
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 75081 21739: Ma'am I wanted to know how many webinars we have in the month of December
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 2 webinars Charmaine
30/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 75081 21739: . Okay ma'am
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 75081 21739: Okay ma'am
Thank you
30/11/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, Charmaine, our conversation regarding the grant has concluded.

It was a pleasure discussing this matter with you.
Wishing you a delightful evening, Charmaine.
30/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 75081 21739: Same with you ma'am

09/12/23, 7:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 7:45 am - +91 75081 21739: 1.according to the performance chat I guess I should in my webinars mostly and also the attendance

09/12/23, 8:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Job Charmaine. We will discuss more about this in our session on Wednesday.
09/12/23, 8:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
