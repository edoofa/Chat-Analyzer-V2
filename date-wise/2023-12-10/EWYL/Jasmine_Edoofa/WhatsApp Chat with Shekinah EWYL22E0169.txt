As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, now let's delve into what your specific responsibilities will be as a *STUDENT LEADER* once the training has been completed.

▪️ Step 1: Contact and reach out to the prospective students.
▪️ Step 2: Educate them about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
▪️ Step 3: Ask them some questions to see if they qualify.

 I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 92053 77175: Yes ma’am
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge, that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $250 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 92053 77175: Yes l do
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead
27/11/23, 4:03 pm - +91 92053 77175: Yes I remember
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please share it with me
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 92053 77175: I lost it 
I recently changed my phone 
And l lost the previous chats
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 92053 77175: Noted
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +91 92053 77175: Following
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 92053 77175: Yes
27/11/23, 4:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - +91 92053 77175: 🤝
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - +91 92053 77175: Following
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:40 pm - +91 92053 77175: Yes ma’am 
I’m willing to put all my effort
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Shekinah, May I know if are your parents in the session?
27/11/23, 4:43 pm - +91 92053 77175: They’re at work 
They’ll read the chats later
27/11/23, 4:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I would really appreciate it if they could share their opinions on the same. 
@263778687029 @263782781181
27/11/23, 4:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 4:49 pm - +91 92053 77175: That’s great job 
I’m really challenged to do better
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - +91 92053 77175: I’m grateful for having a mentor like you
27/11/23, 4:53 pm - +91 92053 77175: I’ll try my best not to disappoint you
27/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 278 1181: Am follwing
27/11/23, 5:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 5:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 5:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 5:03 pm - +91 92053 77175: So for the $300 plan l have to submit 10 quality forms ?
27/11/23, 5:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Shekinah
27/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 868 7029: I'm following
27/11/23, 5:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 5:14 pm - +91 92053 77175: Yess ma’am
27/11/23, 5:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 5:16 pm - +91 92053 77175: I have to reach out to all my peers and share with them the Edoofa message 
And I’ve already started working on that
27/11/23, 5:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready. <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - +91 92053 77175: Very true ma’am
27/11/23, 5:19 pm - +91 92053 77175: Thank you for the wise words 
I’ll work on that 
And l promise by end of November they’ll be a change
27/11/23, 5:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 5:23 pm - +91 92053 77175: Thank you very much
27/11/23, 5:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, Shekinah, our conversation regarding the grant has concluded.

09/12/23, 7:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
