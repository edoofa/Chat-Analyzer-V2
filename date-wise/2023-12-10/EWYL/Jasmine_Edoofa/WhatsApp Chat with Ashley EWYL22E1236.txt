*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

29/08/23, 10:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

I hope your day is off to a fantastic start. I hope you remember we have our session scheduled for today from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm. However, I believe that one hour might not be enough for us to have a thorough and meaningful conversation.

*So, this is why I'd like to offer you some flexibility regarding the timing because I know that you also have a packed schedule. So,  I'll be available to chat with you from 4:30 pm to 8:00 pm today.* Kindly feel free to join me within this timeframe to ensure we have ample time for our discussion. 
_*I'd appreciate it if you could let me know if this arrangement works for you.*_

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We are about to start our call in 5 minutes. Make sure you join on time.

📍*Video call link:* https://meet.google.com/mna-vdag-fkp
25/11/23, 4:35 pm - +91 92891 40616: 1)The Spirit of Competition is the propelling agent that instills a drive to excell, pushing individuals and organisations to continually improve and innovate. It creates a culture of excellence that permeates every aspect of one's work.

2)It has greatly helped me in approaching situations and goals. 
It reminds me of the quote that says‘ Never settle for the average'
I apply it everyday in my life, and it drives me to put more effort in my day to day endeavours, like in my studies.
I've developed a sense of self-confidence which is basically trying to improve your in doing something from the last time you did it. It encourages me to always work hard and aim to be the best version of myself in whatever I do.

3)The Spirit of Competition usually works hand in hand with time management on how i manage my priorities in life. It is said that failure is not only caused by lack of proper planning, it is also caused by not living to what you have planned.
It always drives me to always discipline myself to live according to what i have planned.
For instance, I plan that I should wake up everyday at 4:30, start preparing myself for the day, read for an average of 5 hours in a day, usually during my free periods at school and also at the hostels after college time from 2100hrs to about 0000hrs.
This has greatly helped me with dealing with the pressure of the school projects and I'm excelling very well in my studies right now
So it has been a combination of the Spirit of Competition, Proper time management and Disciplining myself to live according to my priorities.
27/11/23, 7:30 pm - +91 92891 40616: Good evening ma'am😊.

29/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 92891 40616: Okay ma'am
29/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Then came the cool training about the 300$ plan, and congratulations, you're now an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader!* 🎓🌟
Are we on the same page?
29/11/23, 3:38 pm - +91 92891 40616: Yes ma'am. I feel very honoured for this great opportunity bestowed upon me.
I promise to give my best in it😊
29/11/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The core concept of the training was that you have to share information about the Edoofa Scholarship program among students and then for the verification, you have to ask them questions. 

If they nail it, share the offline application. Crystal clear so far?
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 92891 40616: Will i have to develop the questions on my own, or they will be provided by the Edoofa Scholarship Program 😅
29/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 92891 40616: I'm following 👣
29/11/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You have to go it on your own and you can take help from the training document.
29/11/23, 3:45 pm - +91 92891 40616: Ohh, okay ma'am.
29/11/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's delve into the discussion about a platform truly rooted in the 21st century—a space cherished by professionals worldwide. Yep, I'm talking about *LinkedIn*
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 92891 40616: Yes, let's delve into it👣👣
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sure you must have heard about it. Could you kindly share what comes to mind when you think about LinkedIn? What's your take on this professional playground?

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
