01/08/23, 2:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience.

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

25/11/23, 3:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL

Are you ready for the project discussion?

25/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 98722 54219: To me, the Spirit of Competition is all about striving to be the best I can be, and to push myself to achieve ever-higher levels of excellence. It's a mindset that's been with me since the beginning of my High school, and it's what has helped me get to where I am today. Even when I've faced setbacks, the Spirit of Competition has encouraged me to persevere and learn from my mistakes.
