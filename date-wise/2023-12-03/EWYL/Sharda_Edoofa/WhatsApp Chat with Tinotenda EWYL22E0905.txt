But this affirmation is more than just words.

10/08/23, 8:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: So every day, when you recite these words, feel the power and the magic that they contain. Visualize yourself as a proud Edoofian, standing tall and strong, with the world at your feet. Let this affirmation fill you with confidence, hope, and with the knowledge that you are part of something special. And watch as your life transforms before your eyes, as you become the best version of yourself, and as you achieve everything you have ever wanted.

22/08/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done, Tinotenda

22/08/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE
22/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 785 9598: Thank you maam
22/08/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/08/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 785 9598: Óuk ma'am
22/08/23, 9:06 am - Sharda Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Tinotenda?
22/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 785 9598: Still going through it
22/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 785 9598: I'm done ma'am
22/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 785 9598: In short l can say the first project is meant to gain an understanding of the market you plan to enter
22/08/23, 9:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/08/23, 9:24 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes it is also true.
22/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 785 9598: This is done so that you start preparing for it at an early stage
22/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 785 9598: For us to connect with great companies like G-tel we should at least start networking with our families, friends and neighbors then also link with those who work there so that at least you are more experienced on how to have or manage great companies n also creating job opportunities for yourself
22/08/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Tinotenda. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
22/08/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 785 9598: Let me go through it ma'am
22/08/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 785 9598: According to my understanding there are certain procedures that are to be done to make sure that one looks for the right type of companies, one must keep into consideration the following: 
 
a. Nature of the company 

- the nature of the company should either be student-centric (e.g career development platform, ed-tech platforms) or it could be recreational (e.g virtual gaming platforms) or it could be a content- centric platform ( news apps, blogs etc) 

b. Scale of the company 

- the scale of the selected  company should not be either too big or too small l think this is done to balance the company's profits and the employees' salaries.

c. Financial stability

- companies selected must be financially sound and also checking the recent updates from various sources like crunchbase,  linkedln, lnc42 media can help.

d. Background of founder 

- companies with a founder having a strong background in terms of experience and qualifications are the most suitable ones and l think this is because such people are more skilled and come up with new brilliant ideas to keep the company firm

03/10/23, 8:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:25 pm - +91 92893 20479: Evening ma'am
03/10/23, 8:27 pm - +91 92893 20479: I did share with you my Facebook review l'm only left with the Google review. Reason being for not passing it to be honest l'm having pressure since exams are starting next week so l'm being given CA after CA as we are preparing for the exams anyway l'm sorry ma'am will do so before end of tomorrow
03/10/23, 8:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Tinotenda. Since I myself understand how situation gets during exams. I would want you to not worry much rather focus on managing your time wisely and revising all that you have learnt.

03/10/23, 8:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, please share the google review screenshot. Honestly, if you write it now as well, it will not take more than 5 minutes.

05/10/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 225 7820 started a call
10/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 4:10 pm - +91 92893 20479: Evening ma'am.  Ouk ma'am thank you for the new schedule l think its friendly
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please!

11/10/23, 4:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more
11/10/23, 4:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*
11/10/23, 4:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Is everything clear until now?
11/10/23, 4:27 pm - +91 92893 20479: I actually created a WhatsApp group where l can connect with them easily and share the same information

11/10/23, 4:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).

08/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 1: Outreach*

08/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 2: Information Sharing* 
Once we've identified potential candidates, This will be crucial in helping candidates understand what Edoofa is all about.
08/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 3: Eligibility Check*
Now, here's where you'll play a pivotal role. After sharing program information, you'll ask potential candidates to answer specific questions to ensure they truly understand what Edoofa offers. Remember, we want to make sure that the applicants are well-informed about the program and genuinely interested.
Please add any additional questions you think might help in assessing the candidates' understanding.
08/11/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Step 4: Evaluation and Sharing* 
After collecting the answers, you'll evaluate them. Only those who show a clear understanding of the program will be eligible to receive the Edoofa Application form. If any candidate needs further clarification or has misconceptions, please guide them and share the right information.
Your role is crucial in ensuring that we're reaching out to the most deserving and informed applicants. Let's work together to make this process smooth and successful.
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 92893 20479: Ohhh ouk ma'am understood
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 92893 20479: Ouk
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I'm sure you have already created the questions for the verification process. Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.
08/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 92893 20479: I was thinking of connecting with school heads of different schools back home just like now l tried ti reach out to my former school head

08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Tinotenda, these are the questions that you have to explain them. so, you have to explain the answers of these questions to the interested students.
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
.
08/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 92893 20479: Ouk ma'am l understand

Additional Information:

I am sure that you must have heard of two extremely interesting & informative activities during your initial orientation of the EWYL program that are *wednesday wisdom & saturday activity.*

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Tinotenda*
Hope you are well.

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a *Diwali Activity*.
09/11/23, 2:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

25/11/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Tinotenda, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
