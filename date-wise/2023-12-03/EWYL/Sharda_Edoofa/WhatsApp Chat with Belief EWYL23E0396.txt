I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

17/08/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would like to share our weekly newsletter with you.

17/08/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 339 0258: Good afternoon, 

Thank you for being with us. Am just happy to see  my EWYL program progressing.
17/08/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 339 0258: Here I didn't forget, I will provide the response before the  next session .
17/08/23, 1:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am looking forward to it, Belief.
18/08/23, 4:42 am - +263 78 339 0258: *Good morning.* 

As a young and growing Edoofian, I gained a lot from these heartwarming, sympathizing and encouraging news letters from the founder and CEO of Edoofa scholarship program Mr Angad Singh. 

The writer emphasis the students to continue reading books, as they are repositories of wisdom. We extract valuable lessons that can alter our interpretation of the past events and influence our future decisions. Every book has a potential to be catalyst for self discovery and personal growth. 

He still challenges us to be passionate about what we do . *The only way to do great work is to love what we do*. In fact we must change the words into work. He shared a quote" Action is the  fundamental key to success."


*Failure*
For Barrack Obama once said some of most successful people in world are the ones who had  most failures. For   example is Jk Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected twelve times before it was published.  So our failures should teach us what to do next time . So in line with this , *Mr Angad singh* shared a quote " there are no secretes to success. It is a result of preparation, hard work and learning from our failure."
18/08/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
21/08/23, 3:37 am - +263 78 339 0258: Good morning my mentor *Sharda* . I hope the weekend was fine. 

Below is what I understood regarding the projects which will be undertaken .

*Name all three projects*
1. Corporate Alliance
2. Community Building
3. African Schools
 Education Reform Mission.

*What do you understand from project 1?*
Edoofians will represent the Edoofa to build network of partner companies and potential employers , using various professional networking websites like LinkedIn. In this way students will identify local organisations / companies in their countries, regions and beyond . Thereafter they will identify influential people or decision makers and arrange a video call meeting with Edoofa . The most targeted companies are education technology companies, Fintech companies and those that deal in students based products and services. Also these companies must have at least 25 employees and a minimum annual revenue of 1.5 millions dollars. Logically the procedures are divided into activity 1-5.

*Activity 1* 
Focuses on finding such companies on internet.

*Activity 2*
Identifying and reaching decision makers who work in those companies .

*Activity 3*
Sharing Edoofa 's massage.

*Activity 4*
Arranging video calls meeting.

*Activity 5*
Compiling and reporting the entire work done.
21/08/23, 3:37 am - +263 78 339 0258: *Project 2*
*Community Building*

Rays light on reaching African students who have completed and graduated from senior secondary schools recently. These students will be refered to Edoofa program and become one family,  helping the ecosystem  grow. However we are urged to be persuasive enough and have good social impact. All in all the project is more of recruiting new members to join the program. 

*Project 3*
*African Schools Education Reform Mission*
Edoofians will facilitate and help Edoofa to non commercially tie up with various school in their region . Students will speak to local school representatives or decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. 

The main purpose of the collaboration is to share world class technology and innovations happening in Indian schools to improve their education delivery and outcomes. Carrier counseling and sharing courses/ programs and scholarship with high school students of these schools.  It also considers training of teachers , collaboration and tie ups top Indian schools with the African counter parts . 

*Thank you*
*Proudly Edoofian Belief*

These are students who have recently graduated from their  secondary schools or have finished A level and they wish to further their education abroad in India. For me to reach as so many students as I can, I have to ask my class mates friends to add me in their WhatsApp groups and get an opportunity to share my link there . Once they join, I can now start sharing information about Edoofa and advantage of studying in India at low cost. Also I have to add my mentor so that she can track and monitor the progress. Also for her to advise and make sure I provide students with right necessary information.

24/08/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
24/08/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
24/08/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
24/08/23, 9:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
24/08/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

25/08/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
25/08/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:

It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa.

25/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 339 0258: Ok
25/08/23, 9:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
25/08/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
25/08/23, 9:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

31/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 339 0258: Am pleased with the progress
31/08/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
31/08/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: How is your prepration to come to India is going on?
31/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 339 0258: Going well
31/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 339 0258: In final stage.
31/08/23, 9:14 am - Sharda Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.

It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

01/09/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 339 0258: Warmth greetings.
01/09/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 339 0258: I am ready, we can start.
01/09/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
01/09/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 339 0258: Interacting with you in earn while you learn platforms is something special for me. I can not hide . I am really benefiting from it .
01/09/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes Belief. And I enjoy a lot when I get to work with talented students like you.
01/09/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
01/09/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
01/09/23, 9:07 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
01/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 339 0258: Interesting terms .
01/09/23, 9:17 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes
01/09/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: So, Belief, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits

2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency

3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
01/09/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: So Belief, There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me

1. Instagram Username

2. Facebook Username

3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
01/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 339 0258: For Instagram yes I will have to create the account. Remember we are in a country or society where we don't have full access to the internet. therefore, some of these social media platforms were not really useful.
01/09/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 339 0258: Once my Visa and ticket is out by the end of the day, I will resort to full participation.
01/09/23, 9:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Belief I completely understand that. Please do not worry.
01/09/23, 9:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, noted. Please stay committed to your prepration to India as well.

We have understand that by managing to enrol one student for Edoofa scholarship the stages of admission , payments of tuition and tavelling to India each stage has $100. So three stages make up to a total of $300

I hope you are doing well.

Thank you so much for sharing your understanding of the $300 plan.
03/10/23, 8:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
