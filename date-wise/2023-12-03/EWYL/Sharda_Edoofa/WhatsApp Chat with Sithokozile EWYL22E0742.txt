18/10/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I want to let you know that you missed the call on Saturday, which was one of the two calls planned for this month. When you're not there, it makes it hard for us to achieve what we're aiming for.

18/10/23, 4:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, now that we are done for the day, here's a reminder for you about your very own Career Launchpad group, curated by Mr. Anik, which is absolutely on fire right now! 🚀

Joining this group is like securing your golden ticket to a world of opportunities and boundless energy. It's not mandatory, but trust me, you'd be missing out on a treasure trove of greatness if you decide to sit this one out.

25/11/23, 3:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

27/11/23, 12:20 pm - +91 98187 24662: 6 to 7 ma'am
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Evening, Sithokozilw!

 I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +91 98187 24662: Greetings ma'am
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 98187 24662: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Excellent Sithokozile, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 98187 24662: You can redeem either the Edoofa grant or scholarship credits earned by you during the year whichever is higher you cannot redeem both amounts . 

Minimum of 75 % attendance in EYWL and in classes is required to be given the grant
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - +91 98187 24662: I understand ma'am
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 98187 24662: I understand ma'am
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 98187 24662: OK ma'am
27/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	2/6
Attendance	4/6
Orientation	Absent
Fee status	Clear
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 98187 24662: Ma'am l was present on the orientation day
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your update, I can help you with the orientation attendence.
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 98187 24662: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 98187 24662: My phone was the only problem stopping me from attending calls with you ma'am
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I understand that your phone wasn't working well, and that can be frustrating. However, if you were dedicated, you could have tried joining the sessions from a friend's phone or another device. There are many students who tend to attend the sessions from their friend’s mobile!
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 98187 24662: I understand maam
27/11/23, 3:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:38 pm - +91 98187 24662: I understand ma'am
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it

27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 98187 24662: Ok ma'am
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: What would you like to say?
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 98187 24662: I will work accordingly to the plan ma'am and l will not disappoint you this time around
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for your message, and I appreciate your commitment to working according to the plan. I have full confidence in your abilities, and I believe that with your dedication, you can achieve great success.
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 98187 24662: Thank you maam
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session*.
