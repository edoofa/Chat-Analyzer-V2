29/08/23, 5:15 pm - +263 71 766 0908: Greetings Mrs Saloni,

Tomorrow 30 August

How are you?

15/09/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Good day!
19/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Ready for the session.
19/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Seems my network is bad /slow.just getting the chat now.anyway let's begin
19/09/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Liberty will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
19/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Ok
19/09/23, 1:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Just completed downloading, going through it now
19/09/23, 1:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Liberty can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page? <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
19/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Noted with thanks but I just think it's only fair that I highlight at this point that I ANNA, Liberty 's mother would greatly want help in project or however I'm permitted but I may not be so knowledgeable to do the tasks and l also understand that they're meant for the student so it's unfortunate that he may not be readily available for the projects because of the limited (any) use of private phones at school.given the prevailing conditions at his boarding school he may only be free to access internet and the phone after his last final examination when he will home
19/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Thank you

This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening on *TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳ this week.
_Please make sure that either you or your parents are present in the session_🚨
26/09/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 800 2316: Good day
26/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Liberty is back, he/she is supposed to note a few things.
26/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
26/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
26/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
26/09/23, 12:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
