I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!

08/11/23, 4:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As our Saturday call got a Diwali makeover, I've carved out some time today for a super interactive session with you. Let's make it a vibrant exchange of stories and laughter! 🗣️🤗

*TIME* : 06:30 - 7:00 PM

14/11/23, 10:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team.

15/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

This lesson about competitiveness is a very nice and good lesson which I believe is very necessary especially when one is at the very beginning  of their career and the reason I am saying so is because pursuit drives competition hence am totally grateful for the lesson that comes as a reminder that in what ever I do or am pressuring I should have the good spirit of chasing u u r with all mighty and strength .

28/11/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Excellent Siphosenkosi, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 92891 43458: Yes being active in the programme was the sum of it all
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 92891 43458: And being active at school
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 3:08 pm - +91 92891 43458: Yes
28/11/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - +91 92891 43458: Following !!
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 92891 43458: Yes
28/11/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 92891 43458: Done
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:29 pm - +91 92891 43458: No I really do understand what I have t do as given by the table
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will resume on Thursday since I won't be available tomorrow due to some personal commitments. I will let you know the time of the session tomorrow only.
Thank you for joining in!
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What have you not understood?
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 92891 43458: Nothing ma’am
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 92891 43458: Noted
28/11/23, 3:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our weekly EWYL Group session?
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 92891 43458: Yes
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now this is the ideal performance that I believe I can expect from you in order to have your become eligible for your grant.
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what exactly do you want me to explain?
28/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 92891 43458: Honestly nothing the thing i I s all the above stats you recording where whilst I was still trying to properly settle however since a moment of redemption has b even shown I’ll use it
28/11/23, 3:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I did not get you here Sipho, I just got that you were trying to settle in your place, I did not get beyond that. Can you rephrase?
28/11/23, 4:30 pm - +91 92891 43458: Sorry for late response network issues 

I was saying I acknowledge the opportunity that has been bestowed on me once more hence I’ll make good use of it
29/11/23, 8:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Sipho!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.
