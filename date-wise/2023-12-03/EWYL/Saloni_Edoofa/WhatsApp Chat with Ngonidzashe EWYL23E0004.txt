18/08/23, 3:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Ngonidzashe, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call.

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
18/08/23, 3:43 pm - +91 90562 32930: Should the summary of the $300 plan be handwritten also?
18/08/23, 3:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That can be in the form of text.
18/08/23, 3:45 pm - +91 90562 32930: Okay
18/08/23, 4:06 pm - +91 90562 32930: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 4:31 pm - +91 90562 32930: *The $300 plan is as follows:* 

Edoofa has come with another exciting offer for students to earn more scholarship credits. When recruiting during the community building project, a candidate pays for the enrollment fee in two parts. When the candidate pays for the first $200, the student earns 25% of that money. When they compete the final $150 payment, the student also earns a 25%. When the candidate has paid for the $750 registration fee, the student stands opportunity to earn another 25%. And when the candidate has come to India and completes their first semester fees, they also earn another 25%. 

So in total the student can earn up to $300 with just one community building project.
21/08/23, 10:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Ngonidzashe!
How are you?
21/08/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to receive this explanation from you, and I would appreciate if your parents @263773540218 @263773908125 acknowledge the same
21/08/23, 10:48 am - +91 90562 32930: Thank you
21/08/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Also on this, I am so happy to receive this!
I am truly touched by your heartfelt letter, and I want to commend you for sharing your incredible journey as an Edoofian. Your words are not just a reflection of your gratitude but also a testament to your dedication and enthusiasm.

Edoofa has played a significant role in transforming your dreams into reality. Your story of how Edoofa made studying abroad a reality for you is inspiring.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.

11/10/23, 3:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Ngonidzashe, all the forms that you will now be sharing, will now go through a _pre-counseling_ process so that we filter out the students as per the details that they have mentioned, and yes, as I informed you since you are a part of the *$300 plan* your forms will be counseled on priority. Therefore, it is very necessary that all the students that you refer, primarily know:
1. What Edoofa is?
2. How Edoofa can benefit them?
3. Why are they filling out the student application form?
4. Are they aware of your journey?
11/10/23, 3:33 pm - +91 90562 32930: Oh, okay. I understand
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So to ensure the same, we are planning that all the students whose forms you will share, will be shown your video *highlighting your journey and experience*. There we would be required to make a short video on the same.
11/10/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case of the absence of video, your forms will not be counseling, due to lack of video and therefore, you will not be considered for the $300 plan.
11/10/23, 3:42 pm - +91 90562 32930: Okay
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*
11/10/23, 4:07 pm - +91 90562 32930: Understand. Noted

15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?

23/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 90562 32930: I want to ask something. My fees left for next semester is $485. We intend to pay it by 31st December as per university guidelines. Can the grant step in before this deadline?

23/11/23, 3:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing.

23/11/23, 3:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*

23/11/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.
