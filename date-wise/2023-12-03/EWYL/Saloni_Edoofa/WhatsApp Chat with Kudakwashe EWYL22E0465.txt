How are you?
19/08/23, 8:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since the time you have come to India, things have changed enormously. New environment, new friends, new culture, new discipline, and so on. And therefore, being your proud mentor, I along with the entire EWYL Team, thought to reward you for coming such a long way with us and not just this, I want that you to continue putting more and more effort to reach greater heights and to discuss the same, I have scheduled a call with you.

DATE - 19/08/2023, Today
TIME - 03:45-04:00 PM
LINK TO THE CALL - https://meet.google.com/jda-onnt-ozx
19/08/23, 9:46 am - +91 86990 97287: Ok mam
19/08/23, 12:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @918699097287 please join
19/08/23, 12:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Kudakwashe, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call.

Once both things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
19/08/23, 12:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/08/23, 12:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: A handwritten letter can be something like this (this is just a sample for you, don't copy-paste anything)
The letter has to be completely based on your personal experience
19/08/23, 12:33 pm - +91 86990 97287: Okok mam let me write
19/08/23, 12:33 pm - +91 86990 97287: Yaa let me share with you my understanding
19/08/23, 1:31 pm - +91 86990 97287: MY UNDERSTANDING OF $300 PLAN

Edoofa has scheduled a $300 plan in which some few selected edoofians are going to participate in order to get the grant. Students are required to show their  community building skills through inviting new students to be enrolled into the edoofa program . When the enrolled student pays the first $200 admission fee to the edoofa team, the student who invited that enrolled student will get a reward of $75 . If the enrolled student pays the enrollment fee , the student who invited the enrolled student will get $25 on top of that $75 as a reward of hardwork and internship. Once the enrolled student pays the fees , the inviter will get another $100 on top and if the enrolled student come to india, the inviter will also get another $100 as a reward . In total , the inviter will have $300 reward in total and this is for a one student . Which is if the inviter invites more students he/she will get the reward according to the number of enrolled students. 

Lastly , i would like to than my mentor Ms Saloni for selecting me as part of those students who are going to participate in this $300 plan .I am a proud edoofian🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳

Edoofa has played a significant role in transforming your dreams into reality. Your story of how Edoofa made studying abroad a reality for you is inspiring.

d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process.

In this program edoofians get opportunities to learn and enhance our skills by working on real time projects that we get from industry leaders. 

D.For me, instead of paying 6000-8000 which is the usual cost of education in india , i got a 50% scholarship on my tuition fee based on my academics,  merit, extra curriculars, statement of purpose and recommendation from my senior edoofians which brought my cost down to 1475-2950 per year with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits in every EWYL project. Now im working to reduce my cost further.  Some of my senoirs now are paying the whole fees with their grants so , why not me. Now i will work wholeheartedly till i get that grants or credits.

08/11/23, 2:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this,
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 86990 97287: Okok mam i understand now
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 86990 97287: So may i know my attendance for EWYL
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, I will tell!
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 86990 97287: Thik hai
28/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 86990 97287: Okok mam i maintained 75% in academic already

28/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 86990 97287: Samaj giya🤝
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 86990 97287: Yes mam
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 86990 97287: Ok mam i understood
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 86990 97287: I have to put more effort
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
28/11/23, 3:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 86990 97287: Ok mam
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 86990 97287: Ok mam i think i have to attend all sessions from now onwards and im sure more forms of students are coming till December
