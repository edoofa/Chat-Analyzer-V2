03/10/23, 2:50 pm - +91 82645 53793: Sorry ma'am I'm late for session
04/10/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Patience
How are you doing?
04/10/23, 1:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/10/23, 1:38 pm - +91 82645 53793: Greetings ma'am,i am doing well thank you
04/10/23, 1:38 pm - +91 82645 53793: I hope you're also well
04/10/23, 1:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I am very well dear.
04/10/23, 1:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Patience, Shall we start with our session?
04/10/23, 1:42 pm - +91 82645 53793: Yes ma'am we may start
04/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were talking about Project 3. Do you remember?
04/10/23, 1:43 pm - +91 82645 53793: Yes ma'am,i very well remember
04/10/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
04/10/23, 1:46 pm - +91 82645 53793: I agree a 100% ma'am
04/10/23, 1:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
04/10/23, 1:48 pm - +91 82645 53793: Yes ma'am noted
04/10/23, 2:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*I would like to schedule a short call with you today at 6:45 pm*_
Kindly acknowledge this message and let me know of your availability
04/10/23, 2:01 pm - +91 82645 53793: Yes i will be available
04/10/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, For time being let us continue with our session.
04/10/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
04/10/23, 2:52 pm - +91 82645 53793: Yes ma'am
04/10/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to share some exciting news and a wonderful opportunity that I believe could greatly benefit your students at [School Name].
I have been selected as a recipient of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, which will allow me to pursue higher education in India. This scholarship not only makes quality education accessible but also equips students with essential skills for a successful future in an increasingly competitive world. I firmly believe that your students at [School Name] should have access to similar life-changing opportunities. By offering such opportunities, we can empower them to realize their dreams and provide them with the tools they need to succeed.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
04/10/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindy start joining the call
04/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 82645 53793: yes i would like to join ma'am how do I do that
