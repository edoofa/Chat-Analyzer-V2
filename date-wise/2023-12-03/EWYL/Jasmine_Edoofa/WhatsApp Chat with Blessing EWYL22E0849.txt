There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 24-08-2023 at -
_*2:30 pm (Zimb time) / 6:00 pm (Indian Time)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want you to read the Grant Letter that was shared with me along with the FAQ document. Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
*No more sessions will be held after this.*
24/08/23, 12:53 pm - +91 86991 45058: Noted maam l will .
24/08/23, 2:42 pm - +91 86991 45058: The FAQ states that 
For every student who is eligible for the grant and has earned
any amount of scholarship credits will be able to access and redeem the higher value
opportunity  that is either grant amount or scholarship credit
whichever is higer and will forego the lower value opportunity in order to secure the best option for high
affordability
The foregone Grant wont be carried forward to the
following year that is next academic year will have the revised grant and
credit opportunities marked according to the performance.
24/08/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
24/08/23, 2:43 pm - +91 86991 45058: Yes maam
24/08/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - +91 86991 45058: That's a great move indeed thank you for this
24/08/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
24/08/23, 2:47 pm - +91 86991 45058: No
24/08/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - +91 86991 45058: I got it now thank you
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
24/08/23, 2:50 pm - +91 86991 45058: Yes maam you right l can do my best to Accomplishe that aim
24/08/23, 2:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
24/08/23, 2:54 pm - +91 86991 45058: Sure maam we will,are we suppose to print it out first and send it or to sign there
24/08/23, 2:55 pm - +91 86991 45058: There must be still at work now but l believe they will reach out to you as soon they are free from work
24/08/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
24/08/23, 2:58 pm - +91 86991 45058: Noted
24/08/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? I learnt that Edoofa Program offers quality education services. Many people pursued their higher studies in India with Edoofa Scholarship and they did well.And also I learnt that I will earn while studying. 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? I want to pursue with my higher studies in India because of quality education and I want to develop my community.Also my parents cannot afford me money  because they do Small scale Farming which does not provide enough money for me to pursue with my studies.

I trust this message finds you well. I hope your day is going smoothly.

I'd like to address our scheduled call from last Saturday. While reviewing our past conversations, I noticed that the call was missed. In such situations, I believe it is essential for the student to inform us in *advance* if they are going to be unavailable for the scheduled call.

If, however, you were in the church, *it would have been greatly appreciated if you could have notified me when I shared the timetable for our call*. This would have allowed for the possibility of rescheduling at a more convenient time.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL

The social motivation of competing between peers that  can challenge a student to work much harder on his or her tasks than he or she would independently feel compelled to do so.
. Competition teaches critical thinking, decision-making and problem solving Competition is an excellent motivator.Competition increases self-esteem. ...
Learning New Skills is an Easy Way to Improve Yourself.Overcoming Fear is Aided by Competition.Winning and Losing With Class Are Valuable Life Skills.Improving Collaboration and Teamwork.As for me lcompetition helped me at my ordinary level where l was competing with my friends on our exams then we came with better mark and also in many situations compatition has helped me.
