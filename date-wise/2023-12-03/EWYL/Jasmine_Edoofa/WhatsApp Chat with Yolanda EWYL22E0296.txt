29/08/23, 4:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

26/09/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening Yolanda
26/09/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay
26/09/23, 3:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know if this student is coming for PhD? <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 3:08 pm - +91 90414 69230: Evening ma'am how are you
26/09/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
27/09/23, 9:17 am - +91 90414 69230: Good morning ma'am
27/09/23, 9:17 am - +91 90414 69230: May I have the payment plan from enrollment to admission
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So Yolanda I would want you to tell her that this is a scholarship program and based on your merit, results, and application form. The quantum of scholarship is decided. 
You can tell her to fill up the form and then counsellors will get in touch with her
27/09/23, 3:04 pm - +91 90414 69230: She already got admitted. She received the Edoofa admission letter yesterday
28/09/23, 7:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Yolanda, 
That's great. Then she must be aware of the cost now.
28/09/23, 7:57 am - +91 90414 69230: She said she didn't understand and wants me to explain using our language. So I need to understand what she was told so that I can translate the same
28/09/23, 8:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Okay
28/09/23, 8:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Can you tell me her name
28/09/23, 8:28 am - +91 90414 69230: She will be offended so I can't
28/09/23, 8:30 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, See if I get to know her name, I can reach out to the admissions officer and let them know to explain the cost again. Giving you all the details and then explaining further will take a a lot of time. Also, there will be a difference if you will explain her things and if somebody with a lot of experience will do the same.
28/09/23, 8:32 am - +91 90414 69230: She wants me to explain in our mother tongue and the counselors can't speak in Shona so it won't help. 

It's not like she didn't understand but she wants to confirm with me
28/09/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yolanda, dear I understand that you are really worried and you genuinely want to help your friend but you have to understand that now it is only one of your friends, but tomorrow it can happen that you get a lot of students who reach out to you to explain the process. Will you be able to do that?
28/09/23, 8:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: If you will share her name, we won't tell her that you reached out to me rather we will explain everything agaim. If she wants that everything should be explained in Shona then we will do that too.

09/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Dear Yolanda_*,
I hope this message finds you well. As your mentor, I understand the challenges you face with classes, tests, and assignments that can make our meetings difficult.

To provide more flexibility:
*1. We will now have our video calls on alternate Saturdays.*
*2. We'll also connect on alternate Wednesdays through WhatsApp for more accessible interactions in sessions.*
09/10/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday 
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
09/10/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know is the schedule is crystal clear to you. If not, feel free to discuss
09/10/23, 7:07 pm - +91 90414 69230: This coming Wednesday and Saturday I have exams
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, ⭐
_*SESSION TIME FOR TOMORROW here on the EWYL GROUP- 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm*_
Make sure you are present and please acknowledge your availability
11/10/23, 3:25 pm - +91 90414 69230: I would like to know the results of what I have been doing so far.
11/10/23, 3:26 pm - +91 90414 69230: I just found out that one of my friends is already here in India but you didn't tell me. Answer couldn't get intouch due to loss of contacts
11/10/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Give me a minute Yolanda
11/10/23, 3:46 pm - +91 90414 69230: Noted
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yolanda, I will share the details with you tomorrow along with your updated credits.
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - +91 90414 69230: I dont agree because I   only tell them what I know
11/10/23, 3:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 3:58 pm - +91 90414 69230: Noted with thanks
11/10/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 5:18 pm - +91 90414 69230: Yes ma'am
11/10/23, 7:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 7:16 pm - +91 90414 69230: I can do it by weekend now I'm a bit occupied ma'am
11/10/23, 7:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.
