29/08/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

22/11/23, 6:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Reminder: EWYL chat session is back!_*

This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 6:00 PM* here in the EWYL GROUP. 

As you move ahead in your academic journey, I am sure you realize the financial responsibility that comes along with it. I can understand how overwhelming it can it initially but let me assure you that without constant discussions we can manage to work to the fullest in the $300 plan. 

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
*So, let's make the most of the session tomorrow so that we can maximize our impact on our progress*📈
22/11/23, 7:31 am - +263 77 465 9272: Hey ma’am how are you doing
23/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 465 9272: Yeah I do ma’am
23/11/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tadiwa
Do you have your session now Tadiwa?
23/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 465 9272: I think it’s at 6pm
23/11/23, 9:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You had your session yestereday Tadiwa. 
Were you aware of the same?
23/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 465 9272: Yeah I was, something happened during that course. Can you excuse me
23/11/23, 10:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Tadiwa, this isn't the first instance. You've missed several sessions and calls before, giving the impression that the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and my time are not a priority for you. I've been getting ready for our sessions, particularly to advance in the training for the $300 plan. Unfortunately, due to your absence in the last session, we couldn't kick-start it.

Do you believe this is the right approach, Tadiwa?
23/11/23, 2:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Tadiwa*, 
Since we had our session yesterday, I wanted to dedicate the entire time to the session. Now, I am sharing your Lesson of the week today.  Make sure that you go through it and share your understanding by Friday.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 78886 36775: Will share
26/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 465 9272: l learn the information  i get to let myself try in applying it. .According to Saturday Activity I aspire to be someone who sees opportunity and grab it by the neck.

A habit that i have done and made to envision myself everyday was that i got to think and set clearly my goals of what i call success.I aspire to be the best First Gen Lawyer of my time but i understand i have to be an indispensable asset to this world's knowledge.To achieve that i ought to act,carry,work and present myself differently of I don't want the normal desired outcome of success considered by 95% of today's youth.

In this field of study i understand it might be difficult to breakthrough and make an impact.One thing i am preparing myself for now is to be excellent in problem solving despite the task in my daily life.With this i know just and only one day I can develop and implement effective plans/solutions using my unique abilities.

Talking of obstacles I understand there is sometimes the need for team effort. Acknowledgment of the unknown information is the 1st step to opening up and accepting learning from other persons or sources.I think with this determination i will continue to plow through these hardships. 

As for now students work to have bare minimum in CAs, Mid-terms or End Terms but I myself I don't envision or strive for the same fight.
I only see a top way to greatness to which requires my best effort.
