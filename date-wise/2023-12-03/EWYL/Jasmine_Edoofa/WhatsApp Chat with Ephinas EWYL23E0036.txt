22/11/23, 8:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good evening, Ephinas* @918557820779 @260964775597 
I trust you're doing well. Although it's a bit late, there's crucial information I need to share with you.

I hope you remember that you were granted Scholarship Grant 2023 by Mr. Angad during his meet and greet in Africa.

*Tomorrow, on the 23rd of November 2023, I've scheduled a session from 7:00 pm to 8:00 pm.* We'll have a comprehensive discussion about the grant during this time. Please ensure you don't miss it. Wishing you a restful Goodnight.
23/11/23, 12:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon_*
I'd like to remind you about your session today for the Grant discussion. 
Before joining the session, kindly take a moment to review the Grant letter that I'll be sharing below.
23/11/23, 12:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Evening Ephinas!*_🌸
I hope you are doing well. 

Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 85578 20779: Yes thankyou
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia/Malawi. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 85578 20779: Yes I so recall
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant.
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +91 85578 20779: Yessure
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - +91 85578 20779: Understood
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 

Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you deserving.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +91 85578 20779: Understood
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 85578 20779: Yes
23/11/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
23/11/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - +91 85578 20779: Thank you
23/11/23, 4:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
23/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 85578 20779: Alright
23/11/23, 4:32 pm - +91 85578 20779: So when is the session when I get to ask questions
23/11/23, 5:24 pm - +260 96 4775597: I have serious questions about the whole thing you have outlined,  l don't see a Grant at the end of the day?

Yes please go ahead
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - +91 85578 20779: About this
02/12/23, 12:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the letter Ephinas?
02/12/23, 12:46 pm - +91 85578 20779: There is a part I read about the grant saying you have to  pay the whole fees first then take the receipt with you
02/12/23, 12:47 pm - +91 85578 20779: It doesn't make sense to me and my parents because how does the grant work now
02/12/23, 12:47 pm - +91 85578 20779: It we have to pay the whole fees
02/12/23, 12:47 pm - +91 85578 20779: And for the fact that we can't redeem the grant in cash
02/12/23, 12:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You have misunderstood this. For example, your annual grant is 200$ and your fees are 1000$. 
So, first, you have to pay 800$ to the university and once it is paid, we will pay the remaining 200$ via grant.
02/12/23, 12:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, The grant amount will be paid via us directly to the university.
02/12/23, 12:49 pm - +91 85578 20779: Okay so I'll just have to pay the fees minus the grant
02/12/23, 12:49 pm - +91 85578 20779: Okay
02/12/23, 12:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
02/12/23, 12:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you have any more questions? Feel free to ask
02/12/23, 12:52 pm - +91 85578 20779: For now I don't
02/12/23, 12:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The deadline for submitting the signed grant has already passed. 
I would appreciate if you can do it ASAP.
