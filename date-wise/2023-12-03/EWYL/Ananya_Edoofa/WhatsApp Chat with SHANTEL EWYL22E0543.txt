12/08/23, 11:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

Sure, I will be sharing a detailed report card with you in the coming week. Is that alright?
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 735 9285: Yes ma'am thank you
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

10/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 735 9285: my network was weak
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL chat session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. To begin with, I would like to invite you to watch this incredible and relatable video:

https://youtu.be/-RZ86OB9hw4?si=67Pz56KNwC7OFkEe
11/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 735 9285: Good evening ma'am
11/10/23, 3:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Shantel, tell me, what did you learn from the video? You know, this video was shared by my professor when I was a student, and this is something that really stuck in my mind this morning when I was thinking about your sessions.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 735 9285: I understand that Stress has negative and positive effects on our physical and mental well being.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Shantel! Wonderful!🏆
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 735 9285: There are other things we can do to improve our heath to balance for instance socializing with friends and family. Nausia is the result of negative effect of stress
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed. Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience through the video really helped. That's why I would also like you to create a video for your community.
11/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 735 9285: Ok noted ma'am
11/10/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Talking about the video, you can include the following points:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 735 9285: Yes ma'am we are together
11/10/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, now I want you to create this video by Friday evening. Is that alright?
11/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 735 9285: Yes ma'am
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 735 9285: Ma'am you said you will share a detailed report card with me
11/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Shantel. I believe that by the end of the weekend, I will be able to share it with you. There is some technical difficulty on our end, which is expected to be resolved by the weekend.
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 735 9285: Ok ma'am, thank you
11/10/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if you will be able to create a video by Friday?

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Saturday activity_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
