13/09/23, 2:12 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: 😅thanks
13/09/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/09/23, 2:19 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: No I do not tell me please
13/09/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
13/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
13/09/23, 2:26 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Oooh thanks for making me understand
13/09/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
13/09/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 2:33 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Done
13/09/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
13/09/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: This is nice am really looking forward to work with them all
13/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Precious?
13/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: It actually sounds great
13/09/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

The factors to consider in the searching for the right companies are such as Nature of the company, scale of the company, financial stability, background founder and the platforms that can be used are Google, LinkedIn etc.
20/09/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Precious, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

20/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.
And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Oh alright I get it now
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

After that, you will see various websites that might have some information about various companies. Go through those companies, the company whom you think best fits the criterion of being that suitable company, and search for all the details required in the form via LINKEDIN and GOOGLE.
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: I will do so and I will share
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great!
20/09/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Precious, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Precious!
20/09/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Done

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
20/09/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: I have a question 🙂
20/09/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
20/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Have I started the Earning while you learn program that I will be earning ??
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, dear!
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
20/09/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

20/09/23, 2:55 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: I will do it
20/09/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
20/09/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

22/09/23, 2:08 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: On the projects you  to be honest  I don't have physical experience on the procedures on how to approach the schools and convince them to take part in the Edoofa's program
22/09/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.

Q3. Blantyre rural
22/09/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, since your school is connected with us,  I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
22/09/23, 2:19 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright because am not really sure if I can do this  without guidance
22/09/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
22/09/23, 2:23 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright
22/09/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Precious we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

22/09/23, 2:31 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Because it's not that easy here in Malawi to do it hope you get my point
22/09/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, let us do one thing. You should try connecting with your school head only.
22/09/23, 2:36 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: But then our school is already connected with Edoofa I guess I will try to go for another school head

22/09/23, 2:44 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright thanks for notifying me
22/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know,  Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
22/09/23, 2:47 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright on the influencer marketing can you highlight me on that
22/09/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
22/09/23, 2:50 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright
22/09/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
22/09/23, 2:52 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright noted
22/09/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
22/09/23, 2:54 pm - +265 991 56 81 24: Alright I will create the Facebook and Instagram account
22/09/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.

08/11/23, 9:27 am - +265 991 56 81 24: Thanks for understanding
09/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *TUESDAY* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
