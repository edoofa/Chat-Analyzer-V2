I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope you're doing well. I've noticed that you haven't been joining your EWYL sessions and calls for the past three weeks. We only meet once a week for just an hour, and it's alarming that you have not been serious about your commitments. It is crucial that you attend if you appreciate the opportunities you've been given.

I understand that juggling everything can be tough, but remember, stepping out of your comfort zone is essential for your path to success. If you're struggling with time management or facing challenges, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to support you; all you need to do is share your concerns.

09/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨

17/11/23, 6:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings. @263779657570 

I hope this message finds you well. 
Over the past month, our team has extended every possible assistance to ensure your smooth transition to India. Despite these efforts and constant reminders, it is with deep regret that you have not attended your EWYL session for a month, even after rescheduling. 

This lack of engagement is not only concerning but also a matter of great disappointment for me as a mentor. I firmly believe in the importance of a strong work ethic and dedication to one's educational pursuits, and it is disheartening to observe your lack of commitment in this regard.
17/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 965 7570: I'm sorry
17/11/23, 6:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Melissa, personally, I'd like to offer you a final opportunity. I've scheduled a group call for tomorrow. If you can attend, that's great. Otherwise, we can discuss it further. Does that work for you?
17/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 965 7570: 🥹it's really hard to manage time,I have exams and my timetable has no period
17/11/23, 6:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I appreciate your understanding, Melissa! Typically, students from your university consistently attend calls and sessions. You shared your timetable with me, and the slot was available. If there's any specific reason for your unavailability, please let me know, and we can discuss it further.
17/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 965 7570: I understand but some of them have flexible timetables,I attend doubt sessions I'm facing difficulties in my modules

17/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 965 7570: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 6:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I noticed that your last class is until 4:20 PM, and my sessions start at 7:00 PM. Since there's a gap, I assumed it would be convenient for you to join.

23/11/23, 12:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records, I can not find any from your end Mellisa.

25/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
02/12/23, 6:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Mellisa!

Over the past few weeks, I have observed that, due to your classes, exams, and other events, it has been difficult for you to manage calls in the evening. Keeping this in mind, I thought of extending my working hours for you and have changed the timing for the call today.

Time: *8:30 PM*
Video call link:

I hope to see you there!🚀
02/12/23, 5:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly join the call!
02/12/23, 8:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you know I rearranged my whole day just to ensure that you could attend your call and not miss out on any opportunities. However, even after extending my working hours, it is quite disappointing and disheartening that you did not attend the call. Can I know the reason behind this?
