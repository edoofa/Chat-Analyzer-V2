19/10/23, 8:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!

Okay, I understand. I would like to schedule a *call with you at 6:30 PM today* to discuss some important steps toward earning credits. Your insights and input will be valuable, and I'm looking forward to our conversation.

Please confirm your availability for the call at 6:30 PM.
I'm eager to connect and move forward with our discussion.
19/10/23, 8:25 am - +263 78 994 6430: I will be available
19/10/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
19/10/23, 3:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Link to join the meet - https://meet.google.com/icf-wgon-qgj
19/10/23, 4:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you, my student💯. Here are the pointers for your help.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
19/10/23, 4:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The deadline to submit the video is 21st October (Saturday) till 1:00 PM
19/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 994 6430: You never mentioned it as mandatory🙄🤷🏾‍♂️
19/10/23, 4:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: But, don't want to earn credits, because it is to help you out that's why I made it mandatory.
19/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 994 6430: Well
Technically feom what i understood in our call, you mentioned that if we are *having troubles* with convincing the students that the scholarship is real or if they are doubtful about Edoofa, then the solution is to make a video explaining about the points you provided and you also mentioned that some students are failing to identify who told them about Edoofa hence the need to provide the video as backing evidence of who enrolled or introduced them to Edoofa. Im sure this is what you mentioned
19/10/23, 4:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I did.
19/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 994 6430: Now as for me i don't have troubles with the problems that require the video as a solution so why does it have to be mandatory
19/10/23, 4:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Because as you mentioned that I mentioned in the call that it's a backing evidence, that's why.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 994 6430: But in the scenario that the student does provide my name in full then there is no need right?
19/10/23, 4:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Only your name is not the mandate, the student should be fully aware of the Program and the Counselor would be asking questions to the student, the failure of the student to answer those questions your credits would be at stake, that's why is better that you make that video.
19/10/23, 4:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope you got my point.
19/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 78 994 6430: Not really
19/10/23, 4:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I know your doubt.
19/10/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 994 6430: The real significance of the video being mandatory
19/10/23, 5:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Basically, it's for ensuring the credits earned by you.
21/10/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

May I have updates on your video, please.
01/11/23, 1:16 pm - +91 74284 45625: Greetings! I'm Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, EWYL, and I hope this message finds you and your parents in good health.

08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 5:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you.🌸
Also here is the Saturday Activity of the week,

As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
