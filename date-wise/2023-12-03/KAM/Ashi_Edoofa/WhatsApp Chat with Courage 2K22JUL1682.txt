Galgotias University and MVN is one of those universities. And acquiring the new offer letter does not mean that your previous offer letter has been revoked. <This message was edited>
03/08/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 286 0784: Ok I understand. We have gone through the offer letters so you can go ahead

04/08/23, 11:41 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'd like to inquire about the ticket you've shared with us. I noticed you mentioned planning to pay for it. Could you kindly confirm if you've already purchased the actual ticket, considering that the official arrival date has not been released yet?
04/08/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 199 2832: Yes we ready
04/08/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 199 2832: That was a dammy ticket not the actual ticket

04/08/23, 12:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please ask, dear.
04/08/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 199 2832: According to this 
Is food offered or we have to pay for food
04/08/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 199 2832: And if we would like to accept one of these offer letter does it mean that the previous registration fee we paid for GGI has to be reversed and paid to one of these or !?
04/08/23, 12:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please.
04/08/23, 12:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: that is correct it will be adjusted to he university of your choice.
04/08/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Would you just excuse us for an hour we wanna choose wisely then we will be back thank you
04/08/23, 12:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, dear.
04/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes we are about to finish discussing
04/08/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.
04/08/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 199 2832: We have gone through everything now and our final take is the MVN university
04/08/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
04/08/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
04/08/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 199 2832: 1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship $350
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship $0
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship $1600
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable) $250
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat $1000
04/08/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available for the session?
04/08/23, 10:21 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes we are available
04/08/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
04/08/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes that’s great thank you
04/08/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes. Indeed. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
04/08/23, 10:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
04/08/23, 10:25 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes
04/08/23, 10:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
04/08/23, 10:31 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Now we clear
04/08/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
04/08/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
04/08/23, 10:36 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Sorry these experiences we going to pay them !? 
They not being covered by tuition fee !?
04/08/23, 10:36 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Ok we get this
04/08/23, 10:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that you will be required to pay them as the tuition fee if of $350.
04/08/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Ok thank you I understand now
04/08/23, 10:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600 and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
04/08/23, 10:56 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes that’s good
04/08/23, 10:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850- $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
04/08/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes observed
04/08/23, 11:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to secure your scholarship seat with MVN University, a fee of $1000 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar Group of Institutions, the total of $750 that you paid for your fee at Gulzar Group of Institutions will be adjusted against the registration fee at MVN University and hence you would have to pay the difference in fee which becomes $1000 - $750 = $250.

If you decide to change your university and transfer your admission to MVN University, you will have to make a payment of $250 before August 10th. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
04/08/23, 11:04 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes noted
04/08/23, 11:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me share some valuable insights about the university with you:

04/08/23, 11:07 pm - +263 78 199 2832: It’s a nice University thank you
04/08/23, 11:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. Shall we proceed with the discussion of Galgotias university?
04/08/23, 11:10 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Ok we can discuss
04/08/23, 11:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a Four-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 8 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
04/08/23, 11:15 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes
04/08/23, 11:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components  and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
04/08/23, 11:17 pm - +263 78 199 2832: We noticed it
04/08/23, 11:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
04/08/23, 11:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
04/08/23, 11:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
04/08/23, 11:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. 

I hope we are together so far?
04/08/23, 11:21 pm - +263 78 199 2832: Yes I’m following
04/08/23, 11:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -

Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle. 

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

I hope you are doing well, In relation to the outstanding first-year balance fee of $850, we'd like to remind you that this fee is divided into two installments of $425 each. The initial installment should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India, and the second installment is due in the subsequent semester.

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
08/09/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 199 2832: Thank you very much Ms Ashi. We can settle the balance in two installments

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
09/09/23, 10:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
