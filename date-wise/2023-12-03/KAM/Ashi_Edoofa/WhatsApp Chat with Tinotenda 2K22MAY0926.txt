13/09/23, 1:49 pm - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents and Esteemed Eddofians,

I am writing to introduce myself as *Mr. Mukund*, an Associate in the Division of Student Welfare. It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to India, and we are pleased to inform you that they have settled comfortably in their accommodations with all the necessary facilities. Our team is dedicated to providing continuous support and assistance to ensure a smooth experience and I believe they may have already shared their initial experiences with you.

From this point onward, all your queries and concerns will be addressed by the *Division of Student Welfare* through this group. To familiarize you with our team, we have *Mr. Rithvik Rana*, the Head of the Division of Student Welfare, and myself, *Mr. Mukund*, an Associate in the same department.
13/09/23, 3:09 pm - +1 (214) 735-4349: Noted and thank you
14/09/23, 11:46 am - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents and Esteemed Edoofian
This is Mr.Mukund , Division of Student Welfare 

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the upcoming fee payment deadline for Edoofian students.
The balance for the fee is *$1387*
The deadline for fee payment is fast approaching, and it is essential that payments are made by the specified due date. This not only helps us in planning and allocating resources effectively but also avoids unnecessary inconveniences for both the institution and the students. 

Your commitment to timely fee payments is greatly appreciated, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the high standard of education that Edoofian stands for.
14/09/23, 1:15 pm - +1 (214) 735-4349: Alright, please. Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $2250, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2250 - $1000 = $1250. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
14/09/23, 1:26 pm - +1 (214) 735-4349: Hello Mukund Edoofa. My question is that $1387 is going to cover the year or what? And also is it going to do the same with $1250 I forwarded to from the previous conversation. Please can you make it clear. I was told that the admission fee of $1000 will be adjusted against first year’s expenses of $2250. Is it still the same? 
I am getting a bit confused especially when the figures are coming out differently. I paid $124 a day before yesterday and it was just titled a part of the fee. So can please explain a bit? Thanks
15/09/23, 8:41 am - +91 93546 23922: Per Annum Fee at MVN - $2250 
For the first year - $250 (One time payment) is added, making the total amount $2500. 

Registration Paid - $1000
Since you've already paid $1000, the balance for the first year becomes: $2500 - $1000 = $1500. 

This balance of $1500 was to be paid in two parts of $750. Since you have paid $113, the balance for now $637. When you add this to the fee of $750 due later on, the total is $1387.

I hope all the confusion is clear
Please let me know if you still have doubts
15/09/23, 9:04 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: Can you please send to me the invoice of $1387.
15/09/23, 9:04 am - +91 93546 23922: alright will do that sir
15/09/23, 9:06 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: I am a woman sorry point of correction
15/09/23, 9:06 am - +91 93546 23922: Sorry Ma'am
15/09/23, 9:07 am - +91 93546 23922: We'll be sending you invoice for the same in a while ma'am
15/09/23, 9:07 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: No problem
15/09/23, 9:08 am - +91 93546 23922: Also the invoice would be of $1526
Including the transfer charges
15/09/23, 9:08 am - +91 93546 23922: Should we proceed with the same
15/09/23, 9:10 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: Why would you charge the transfer charges? Where will you transfer money to ? I thought I am paying to the school directly.
15/09/23, 9:11 am - +91 93546 23922: yes its a payment directly to school only
But a payment made from Zimbabwe itself to India would require transfer charges
15/09/23, 9:12 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: I am not paying from Zimbabwe
15/09/23, 9:12 am - +91 93546 23922: where are you making the payment from
15/09/23, 9:12 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: I am in the USA 🇺🇸
15/09/23, 9:13 am - +91 93546 23922: let me confirm the updated amount then
15/09/23, 9:14 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: To make the maters worse I am paying in USA Dollars.
15/09/23, 9:14 am - +91 93546 23922: If you are making a bank transfer, in that case the invoice would be for $1387 and the charge would depend on the bank.
15/09/23, 9:17 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: I am not making a bank transfer. I will pay using my debt card
15/09/23, 9:18 am - +91 93546 23922: In that case the invoice will be of $1526
15/09/23, 9:24 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: So where will you transfer the money to ? The question remain the same.
15/09/23, 9:25 am - +1 (214) 735-4349: Go ahead and send that invoice but my question remain the same
15/09/23, 11:25 am - +91 93546 23922: The money will be transferred directly to MVN university routed through EDOOFA
15/09/23, 7:41 pm - +91 70272 86232 was added
15/09/23, 7:41 pm - +263 71 984 9771 left
16/09/23, 9:24 am - +91 93546 23922: Greetings I am sharing the invoice now
16/09/23, 9:26 am - +91 93546 23922: Can you please share your email address with us
