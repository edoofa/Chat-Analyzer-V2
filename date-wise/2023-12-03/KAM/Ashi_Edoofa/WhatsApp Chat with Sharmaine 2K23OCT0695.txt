02/11/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Sharmaine, 

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
02/11/23, 4:24 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes we are
02/11/23, 4:24 pm - +27 74 649 0272: <Media omitted>

02/11/23, 4:24 pm - +27 74 649 0272: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
02/11/23, 4:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let's move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA Sociology* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
02/11/23, 4:47 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Correct
02/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
02/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
02/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
02/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/11/23, 5:02 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Right
02/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
02/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
02/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
02/11/23, 5:09 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Correct
02/11/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
02/11/23, 6:13 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Noted
02/11/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
02/11/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
02/11/23, 6:20 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
02/11/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
02/11/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
02/11/23, 6:43 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
02/11/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
02/11/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
02/11/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
02/11/23, 6:49 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
02/11/23, 6:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 7:00 pm - +27 74 649 0272: So far so Good
02/11/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
02/11/23, 7:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
02/11/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
02/11/23, 7:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 7:18 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
02/11/23, 7:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
02/11/23, 7:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
03/11/23, 11:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Sharmaine,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. In our conversation yesterday, we were in the midst of addressing crucial aspects related to your academic journey.

However, halfway through our discussion, we did not receive a response from your end, and consequently, I have been expecting a reply from you. Could you please confirm if you had the opportunity to go through my previous messages and if we are still connected with each other?
03/11/23, 12:24 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Good morning
03/11/23, 12:24 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes we are connected
03/11/23, 12:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @27746490272. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
03/11/23, 12:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
03/11/23, 12:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
03/11/23, 12:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
03/11/23, 12:32 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes I have reviewed them
03/11/23, 12:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
03/11/23, 12:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
03/11/23, 12:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Sharmaine, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing her seat before the competition even begins. She will be the trailblazer among her peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
03/11/23, 1:10 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
03/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
03/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
03/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
03/11/23, 1:12 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes it did
03/11/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
03/11/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
03/11/23, 1:19 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Precisely
03/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
03/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
03/11/23, 1:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
03/11/23, 1:21 pm - +27 74 649 0272: So far so good
03/11/23, 1:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
03/11/23, 1:22 pm - +27 74 649 0272: U can provide mi with more information
03/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Surely @27746490272, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
03/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
03/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
03/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
03/11/23, 1:25 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
03/11/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
03/11/23, 1:50 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
03/11/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/11/23, 2:11 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
03/11/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
03/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
03/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
03/11/23, 2:14 pm - +27 74 649 0272: That's good
03/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
03/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
03/11/23, 2:15 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
03/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
03/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
03/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/11/23, 2:19 pm - +27 74 649 0272: So far so good
03/11/23, 2:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
03/11/23, 2:30 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
03/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course.

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/11/23, 6:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
17/11/23, 6:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
17/11/23, 6:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Evening thank you for informing but we won't take this GALGOTIAS not for any reason. We will wait for other offers if any if not then we have to talk about the already paid sums.
17/11/23, 8:18 pm - +27 74 649 0272: 9 am is fine
17/11/23, 8:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27746490272, May I know why you don't want to go for Galgotia University?
17/11/23, 8:28 pm - +27 74 649 0272: First and foremost I requested for LPU University for both my Children. As I can not fave them far from each other. And at LPU University there is one of their brother there so I would like for these girls too to go at the same University. I can't have them separately especially these Twins. I can't separate them
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Also this University I am hearing about the teacher not being serious about their students and the way they treat students is not pleasant. The facilities are beyond renovated. And the university only cares about the money u have to pay and they pressuring
18/11/23, 11:22 am - +27 74 649 0272: Morning all was 9:00 am for today
18/11/23, 11:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Sharmaine,

Please excuse my inability to continue our discussion yesterday, I had to attend to an urgent call. By the time I became available, it was quite late on our end, and unfortunately, we couldn't reconnect. However, I am available today and have thoroughly reviewed the last message you shared.
18/11/23, 11:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your preferences and concerns regarding LPU University for your children. I completely understand the importance of keeping your children together, especially as twins, and having one of their brothers at the same university is a significant consideration. Rest assured that we have already shared Sharmaine and Shantelle's application over there and we are expecting an update from them towards the end of next week.
18/11/23, 11:38 am - Ashi Edoofa: With the same update, I would also like to share a concern that I have on my mind regarding the feedback you've heard about Galgotias University. 

I appreciate your insights and it is crucial to consider various aspects when making such decisions. However, what concerns me is that the information you have is not accurate. If I may ask, may I know who informed you of these details because none of them are true?
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - +27 74 649 0272: We will be so greatfull.
18/11/23, 12:08 pm - +27 74 649 0272: There are some students which I can't reveal their identities who recently enrolled to this university.So mi as concerned Parent I will not give this a deaf ear to it for what so ever reason and for such a great distance where I cannot easily go and confirm for my self.
18/11/23, 12:09 pm - +27 74 649 0272: And the other thing I just tried to check this University on internet and the results are also not pleasant I am sorry
18/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I truly understand your perspective and if you feel that revealing the name of the student is not the right thing, we truly understand that. However, with said I would reiterate that the information that you have received is inaccurate. You know all the student who came to Galgotias University through Edoofa made the payment of their first year fees with in the first three days of their arrival. None of them had any financial pressure from the University regarding their fees. 

Hence, that's make me believe that the updates you received are inaccurate, and the only reason I am asking for the name is that a student is genuinely facing a concern that is something we can verify and have a discussion with the student. If this is an assumption on the updates as you shared which are inaccurate that would be a loss for Sharmaine itself. As Galgotias University is one of the top rank university in India and none of the students have highlighted any such concerns, the rest is upto you ma'am we can only share the best recommendation.
18/11/23, 12:33 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Thank you so much for this information I do understand you queit well but I still say LPU for  my  all Children
22/11/23, 5:24 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Greetings, Afternoon
22/11/23, 6:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharmaine, How are you doing today?
22/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 619 4849: We're fine thanks and you
23/11/23, 5:27 am - +27 74 649 0272: Morning
23/11/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sharmaine, I hope you are doing well.

27/11/23, 4:22 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok thank you
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @27746490272
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok Have a great Evening
30/11/23, 9:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Sharmaine,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *LPU University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
30/11/23, 9:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
30/11/23, 9:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
30/11/23, 9:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:22 pm - +27 74 649 0272: God is Good 🙏🙏
30/11/23, 9:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @27746490272, Let's reconnect in the evening at 06:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete LPU University admission formalities.

For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
30/11/23, 9:36 pm - +27 61 078 9523: We are very happy
01/12/23, 5:39 am - +27 74 649 0272: Morning 6:00pm is fine.
01/12/23, 5:36 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Good Evening all I am ready when you are!!!.
01/12/23, 5:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Sharmaine!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
01/12/23, 5:41 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes we did
01/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
01/12/23, 5:48 pm - +27 74 649 0272: 1- $975
2- 3Years (6Semesters).
3-$200
4-$700
01/12/23, 5:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
01/12/23, 5:56 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
01/12/23, 5:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
01/12/23, 5:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
01/12/23, 5:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
01/12/23, 6:01 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Ok
01/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
01/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
01/12/23, 6:07 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes it's clear
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Fantastic! You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
01/12/23, 6:15 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
01/12/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 14th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
01/12/23, 6:19 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I saw where it was written 15 days or within 30 days time frame
01/12/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes please, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee.
01/12/23, 6:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of December 14th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of January 14th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
01/12/23, 6:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before *December 14th, 2023*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
01/12/23, 6:31 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes
01/12/23, 6:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
01/12/23, 6:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
01/12/23, 6:53 pm - +27 74 649 0272: I now have a Mama money account I will use that one if it's not a problem
01/12/23, 6:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, please you can use Mama Money for making the payment of Registration fees at LPU University.
01/12/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
01/12/23, 6:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
01/12/23, 7:00 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Yes we are clear
01/12/23, 7:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
01/12/23, 8:16 pm - +27 74 649 0272: And here also
01/12/23, 8:38 pm - +27 74 649 0272: Can I understand the not Opted  on the letter

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
