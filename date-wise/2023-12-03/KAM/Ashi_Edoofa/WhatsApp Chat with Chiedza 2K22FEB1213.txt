31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Chiedza!
I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?
31/08/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Good evening. Would you be kind enough to discuss with us anytime tomorrow as it is now very late. Sorry for the late response am only seeing your message now
31/08/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, let me schedule our discussion for tomorrow at 10.00 AM and we will proceed from there. Until then, have a pleasant evening!
01/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza!
I hope you are doing well today.
01/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: As per the schedule that we had set for our conversation today, shall we move ahead to start with the discussion now?
01/09/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 867 5258: Good morning
01/09/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 867 5258: Yes please
01/09/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Medical Laboratory Technology.
01/09/23, 10:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
01/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 867 5258: Am not sure I really understand.  Are you saying there is an opportunity to get into a different new university? 
2. Also an opportunity to change course from Bachelor of Science in Microbiology to Medical Laboratory Technician
01/09/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your questions, Chiedza. Let me clarify the opportunity for you:

1. Yes, there is an opportunity to consider a different university. Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university in India called MVN University. This collaboration has led to a unique scholarship opportunity for students like yourself.

2. Regarding the course, you currently have plans to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology. However, under this new opportunity, you have the option to pursue a course in Medical Laboratory Technology at MVN University.
01/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 867 5258: Ok I understand.
01/09/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 867 5258: Changing the university I understand but it's the changing course that am not sure about now
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, I would like to mention that MVN is one of the top universities that we are partnered with, and the academic board has worked extensively with them to make sure that they can provide the best options for students like yourself to ensure that you will excel in your career. And as a result, they have strongly suggested that you should pursue the specified course i.e. B.Sc. MLT. I hope you understand?
02/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Afternoon
02/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Yes I do understand but if the door for me to pursue microbiology course at pdm is still open I would rather take that one
02/09/23, 9:37 pm - +27 63 097 7119: Afternoon to you
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: I understand where you are coming from Chiedza, however, let me also help you in understanding more about why is it that we have reconsidered your application:

1. Your application is being reconsidered as a part of a whole batch of students who were shortlisted for the opportunity that the academic board is offering here in which they get the chance to study a much better course that can lead them to have a better career with the costs being cut down to a huge margin to ensure that they can be comfortable with the finances of their higher education as well. Is that clear now.
05/09/23, 10:07 am - Milan Edoofa: 2. Just recently the university experience rankings and overall rankings were released among the educational partners here in India and in that, PDM University did not do quite well while MVN was among the top performers. Additionally, the response that we are receiving from the side of the students at PDM University has not been too good in terms of the experience that they are getting. Now, we want to make sure that each one of our students should get the best while they are here in India.

I hope you are clear with this?
05/09/23, 10:11 am - +27 63 097 7119: Clear but .does the option offer the same degree..
05/09/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 867 5258: Good morning
05/09/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 867 5258: So MVN does not offer microbiology?
05/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 867 5258: Thank you so much for considering me and offering a better opportunity for me. Much appreciated
05/09/23, 10:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, the opportunity that has been offered to you is for the course B.Sc. Medical Lab Technology and not for Microbiology please. I hope you are clear with that?
05/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 867 5258: I understand but am trying to understand why. Is microbiology course not available
06/09/23, 2:31 am - +263 77 867 5258: Good morning.  I will take the MVN  offer. Thank you so much
07/09/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Chiedza!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Good afternoon.  We are well thank you

08/09/23, 1:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please.
08/09/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 867 5258: You're welcome
08/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Parents and Chiedza, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from MVN University, along with a remarkable 90% scholarship! Congratulations on this incredible achievement.
08/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a 90% scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
08/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Thank you so much Mr Milan . Will review the letter then get back to you. Thank you once again
08/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome dear. Once you are done going through the offer letter, please let me know. <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 867 5258: I have looked through the letter and I have some questions
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat? <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Per annum tuition fee after scholarship is 350us
2. Per annum accommodation is 0
3. Annual fee 1600us
4. Sports and misc fee 250us
5. Admission and processing fee is 1000us
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Indeed it is
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
08/09/23, 2:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
08/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 867 5258: I understand
08/09/23, 3:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
08/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 867 5258: All the other payments I understand just the EDP and Book bank fee that I don't understand what its  about
08/09/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: The EDB fee is a charge that contributes to various educational development initiatives within the university. The Book Bank fee typically covers access to a university's book bank or library resources. This fee can give students access to textbooks, reference materials, and other academic resources without the need to purchase these materials separately. I hope this is clear?
08/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Yes . What's the EDP and Book bank
08/09/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Chiedza, please go through this message of mine once dear.
08/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Sorry network problems this side
08/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Understood. Thank you
08/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
08/09/23, 3:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
08/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 867 5258: I understand
08/09/23, 3:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
08/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Yes EWYL is a great help indeed
08/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850  - $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
08/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Yes I understand
08/09/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
08/09/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Will have to confirm with my dad then get back to you
08/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Have spoken to him. We can pay on monday
08/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Are we still making payment through Mr Shorwi
08/09/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, since you made the payment of your registration fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC bank Account, you can go ahead to make the payment of the remaining amount through him as well. If you want, shall I share his bank details with you here again?
08/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Yes please but last time fbc bank bulawayo has closed and we were making payments through inbucks
08/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Not sure if the bank reopened
08/09/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can check if the bank is open, otherwise, you can do that through Innbucks as well. I hope this is clear?
08/09/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Yes it is. Kindly send the banking details please
09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Chiedza!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. If you are planning to make the payment through Innbucks, then here are the details of Mr. Shorwi, you can move ahead to make the payment on these details:

I am Ms. Vilsha, the head of admissions at Edoofa. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi has been feeling a bit under the weather for the past two days and, unfortunately, won't be able to connect with you. 

However, in her absence, please rest assured that I am here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have.
18/09/23, 11:06 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Good evening to you too
18/09/23, 11:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I was able to review the screenshots you shared, and based on the information provided, it appears that there might be an issue with an extra white space entered after the email ID. This could be causing difficulties in submitting the form. Additionally, for the visa type, it should be specified as a "student visa."
18/09/23, 11:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The problem you're facing is a common occurrence due to network challenges. To resolve this, I would like to encourage you to follow these steps:

1. Recheck the information you've entered, especially the email ID, and make sure there are no extra spaces.
2. Ensure that the visa type is correctly selected as "student visa."
3. Clear your browser history and cache.
4. Restart your browser and attempt to submit the form again.

These steps should help in resolving the issue. If you continue to face difficulties, please let us know, and we will provide further assistance.
18/09/23, 11:10 pm - +263 77 867 5258: We have been really trying and it's not just the issue with the email address box only. Sometimes we can't get options on other questions to answer.  We have been using different devices still facing same problem. Different internet cafes same problem. We ended up asking the father in South Africa to try that side still same problem honestly we don't know what to do now.
18/09/23, 11:11 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Visa type  , purpose it's not giving us the option to fill sometimes so I don't know now
18/09/23, 11:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: @263778675258, in that case, let me reshare the link to the form with you once again, maybe this would assist you -

19/09/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 867 5258: And also the admission letter from the university.  Is if the same as the offer letter ?

However, I'm glad to see that you were able to resolve the issue at your end and successfully fill in the form. Your convenience and success in this process are our priorities.
20/09/23, 12:44 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Regarding the bona-fide letter and admission letter from the university, we have already requested these documents from the university, and they are actively processing our request.

26/09/23, 9:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: That is alright, I understand and regarding the medical certificate requirement, I want to clarify that obtaining it is entirely optional.

26/09/23, 9:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 867 5258: Ok. I had seen it on the admission letter that she has to provide it upon arrival at MVN University
26/09/23, 9:47 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, @263778675258
26/09/23, 9:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that you have all the details with you. Please go ahead and complete your visa application form, and if you encounter any persisting challenges, kindly provide screenshots of the issues you are facing. This will enable me to have a clearer understanding of the situation and provide you with more precise assistance.
26/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 867 5258: Since you're saying it's optional won't it be an issue if she doesn't have it
26/09/23, 9:48 am - +263 77 867 5258: Understood
26/09/23, 9:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: No @263778675258, since the same is optional. In case Chiedza doesn't have it, it would be perfectly fine and hence you can go on without the same.
26/09/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 867 5258: Alright. Thank you
27/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 867 5258: Good afternoon.  Yes managed to fill . Tomorrow will go to the internet Cafe for  downloading the form. Kindly bear with us as we still experiencing network problems . We have finished every section .

08/10/23, 10:00 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Chiedza,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 10th of Oct at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
08/10/23, 10:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
08/10/23, 10:01 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Chiedza 2K22FEB1213*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5.  Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
08/10/23, 10:02 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.
