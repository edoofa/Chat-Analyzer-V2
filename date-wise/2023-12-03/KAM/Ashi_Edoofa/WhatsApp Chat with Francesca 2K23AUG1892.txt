Our goal here remains the same: *To ensure that every Edoofian is treated with the same respect and care, and now that you've been accepted into the scholarship program, I'd want to walk you through the steps you'll be taking*
23/08/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, I would like to share that our available hours are from *12.00 pm to 04:00 pm* and our discussions will be held from *07.30 pm to 11.00 pm* so make sure that you are available during our discussion hours so that, our discussion will be carried out within the same duration. I hope you have taken note of our discussion hours?
23/08/23, 7:58 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: noted
23/08/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. I would even like to inform you that this group wants equal participation of Parents if the student is unavailable, and it would be appreciated if you share your reasons for not connecting beforehand if you or the student is not available.

As the admission process discussion is likely to finish within 4 days, so please be attentive so we can carry the process smoothly without any delay. I hope we are clear on this?
23/08/23, 8:02 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: very clear
23/08/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Kunal, and he did brief me about Francesca's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of her and must be working towards providing her with the best opportunities to kick-start her career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
23/08/23, 8:04 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Clear
23/08/23, 8:07 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: as a parent..I liked that she will be getting her education on a different culture setting, which will give her an added advantage, and that it comes with hands on training...which is hard to get here in Malawi.
23/08/23, 8:08 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: The diversity of the students selection is an added advantage to life skills.
23/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I’m delighted to know that you had such a great experience! Now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
23/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Francesca 2K23AUG1892)* will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
23/08/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Francesca EWYL23E0581)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. However, you will be provided with a dedicated EWYL line as well, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
23/08/23, 8:12 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: I liked the fact that this scholarship gives me the chance to achieve my childhood dream and I will get to learn other cultures too

23/08/23, 8:17 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: is this to be filled by the student or the parents?

24/08/23, 11:51 am - +265 991 89 00 28: This message was deleted
24/08/23, 11:52 am - +265 991 89 00 28: Question: What do you mean sponsor?
If sponsor means who will be paying for her, then it I, the mother

24/08/23, 11:55 am - +265 991 89 00 28: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 11:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records. 

Now that we are done with the feedback forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
24/08/23, 11:59 am - +265 991 89 00 28: yes..available for the next 30 min
24/08/23, 12:06 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Bit if it requires more time, more we meet at 2pm please?
24/08/23, 12:06 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: I am about to go into a meeting.
24/08/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That would be fine, If you are available now, we can start, the discussion will not take more time.
24/08/23, 12:10 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Am sorry...a meeting was supposed to start at 12.30. it is about to start now. Very very sorry.
24/08/23, 12:10 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: I should be back online by 2pm
24/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I shall wait for your response.
24/08/23, 12:10 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Thank you very much
24/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
24/08/23, 2:48 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: She currently does not have a passport or a national ID, but we will start working on that immediately.
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: With this new information, would it be okay to start the process now....or, after she has these things?
24/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, we would require a passport or a national ID. You can apply for anyone, and once you receive the same you can share that, in the meantime, you can share your national ID instead. And yes I am aware of the fact that JCE exams were stopped for a time being, In that case, may I suggest you please request a letter from the school about the same, stating that by your time JCE was removed and Francesca has passed the equivalent examination that was held in place of JCE. 

I hope we are clear?
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: clear...thanknypi
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: thank you
24/08/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great you are welcome, so now shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
24/08/23, 3:21 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: yes please
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
24/08/23, 3:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
24/08/23, 3:30 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Thank you, Francesca did let me know that she was having trouble with internet today. So she may take longer to view them.
24/08/23, 3:31 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: You did say your hours are up to 4.30pm. right? and evening from 8 to 11pm?
24/08/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed. If the internet is a problem we can connect at 09.00 pm today. If that is fine by you?
24/08/23, 3:35 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: This is fine, thank you
24/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, Have a great day we shall reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
24/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, With regard to our conversation, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
24/08/23, 8:26 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Going through the last one right now
24/08/23, 8:26 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: I had problems with my network and still do
24/08/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand. I shall wait for your response. <This message was edited>
24/08/23, 8:28 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Okay thank you
24/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
24/08/23, 8:39 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: I have finished watching them
24/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
24/08/23, 8:51 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: I have also gone through them. But will let Francesca answer all the questions, as I feel it was really more about the student than parents.
24/08/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have also gone through the videos, the videos are for both the parent and the student understanding as well, however, if you feel that @265987476011 should be the one to answer, then we shall wait for her response. I am really excited to know her understanding from the videos.
24/08/23, 8:58 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Yes ..and I can just add to her response if need be.
24/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, that would be absolutely fine.
24/08/23, 9:00 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: My understanding from the first video is that for one to be a successful Edoofian is it very important to follow instructions of edoofa and must be open minded and teachable 
In the second video what I have taken note is that wishes success  on a student and shows you the path path to success and takes a person's capacity and turns it into a whole success
24/08/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I shall wait for your response to all the videos.
24/08/23, 9:11 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: to add to her response, in the 1st video, I learnt that it is important to have the right attitude. To be a "go getter"...to ask people who are experts for assistance, to take initiative...as Steve Job did, as a 12 year old, called a CEO of a company...he was very brave for his age.

Students who don't make it are those who blame others, for their failures in life.
24/08/23, 9:12 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: The third video talks more about the schools in thr Edoofa platform that Edoofa has invested a lot of time to identify the best universities for any passionate Edoofian about 10 years and so.....
The last video talks more about the statement pf purpose  that it is a very important document because it gives the best first impression and convinces why the student is worthy to be enrolled and os best to include why one has chosen the particular college and program....it basically must include one's academics
24/08/23, 9:15 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: In the 2nd video, Edoofa s vision is to make the students employable, at the end if their program.  Edoofa can help this by providing a community of like minded people, and learning the skill sets needed. With the right attitude, it is possible.
Parents have to sometimes give a harsh reality in order for a student to succeed. Edoofa has over 10 years of experience in this field and can help students suceed.
24/08/23, 9:19 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: The 3rd video also mentions the basic skills needed to suceed:
1. attitude
2. skills
3. knowledge

all these are necessary for one to succeed. The students being able to work part time will provide them with these basic skill sets.

The 4th video is about documentation and more especially the SoP. It should not be hurriedly written...must invest time to have a well written SoP. Student is to be resourceful and do so without much delay.
24/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I am glad to see that @265991890028 and @265987476011 you have understood the videos very well, and I am amazed to go through your understanding. In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
24/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
24/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
24/08/23, 9:29 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Thank you
24/08/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I would like to inform you that. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
24/08/23, 9:35 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Okay....noted
24/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
24/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
24/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!

24/08/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: And as shared with you earlier today. 

*1. MSCE Result/Letter of Recommendation./ MSCE Statement of result for term examination*

*2. JCE Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
24/08/23, 9:43 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Thank you...good night
24/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, Let us reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 Pm. I hope you will be available. Have a great night.
25/08/23, 10:46 am - +265 987 47 60 11: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 10:56 am - +265 987 47 60 11: To answer the second question you can Define rights as basic entitlements or privileges that one has and are protected and followed as laws they contain protections such as freedom of speech religion and fair trial. While duties on the other hand are responsibilities that individuals have towards Society and to others. Duties may include obeying lawa and paying tax and respecting other people's rights.

When it comes to Human Rights and civil rights human rights are Universal meaning every individual has human rights by virtue of the humanity. They are safe guided by cities and conventions to protect individuals from discrimination or other forms of abuse. Civil rights on the other hand are specific to particular country they may include the following rights right to vote right to a fair trial and freedom from discrimination within the nation's borders
In summary, while both rights and duties shape the relationship between individuals and society, rights focus on entitlements and freedoms, whereas duties pertain to responsibilities and obligations. Human rights are globally recognized and apply universally, while civil rights are specific to a country
25/08/23, 11:22 am - +265 987 47 60 11: When it comes to the third question a prosecutor and an attorney are both legal professionals but serve different roles in the legal system. A prosecutor is also known as a district attorney or state's attorney is appointed by the government responsible for representing the state or government cases. Their primary rule is together evidence, build cases against the defendant and to prove the accused person guilty in court. Persecutors work is to ensure Justice is served.
An attorney on the other hand is illegal professional that provides legal advice and representation to clients in different legal matters. They can specialize in different areas of law. For example they can specialize in family law corporate law property law and many more. They also made represent clients in both criminal and civil cases. They can also work as defense lawyers representing individuals bringing forth legal claims.
In summary a persecutor focuses on representing cases against criminals on behalf of the government while an attorney represents and gives advice to clients and is more wide than a prosecutor <This message was edited>
25/08/23, 11:52 am - +265 987 47 60 11: Answering the fourth question I have chosen to study criminal law. This is because criminal law deals with offenses against the state involving persecution of individuals accused of crimes since I want Justice and desire uphold the law I feel like this is the right field for me because I get to become a defense attorney.
Civil law is good but just not for me it involves better understanding of legal principles and it also covers wide areas, such as property and family law but I desire to fight for justice and criminal law is all about Justice and criminal law is much better too because there are crimes  committed daily and a lot of people we need lawyers attorneys, and this would be a very good opportunity for me if I get to study the criminal law. Corporate law focuses on legal aspects of business and I don't want to be in the business department as I have already mentioned I want to be in the criminal department. I have made my choice because of my interest and career goals civil law and corporate law don't go well with my interests and career goals. Civil law offers understanding the legal principles, corporate law centers on business dynamics while criminal law pursues Justice in criminal matters as such I prefer to study criminal law thsn corporate law and civil law. Thank you very much <This message was edited>
25/08/23, 12:29 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Due to my research I found that a successful lawyer must have legal knowledge, communication skills, critical thinking and research skills to provide effective representations and achieve good outcomes for the client. As such I am one who loves researching and I'm good at researching. When it comes to critical thinking I am good at that too for example I had a critical thinking exam that I scored 100%. When it comes to communication skills I can say that I have them too. For example if I'm to be presenting a client in a criminal case I must have understanding in criminal law and must have good oral communication skills to be able to present the case convincingly in court. I must also have critical thinking skills to make my arguments effective. Effective communication skills helps lawyers and articulates arguments persuasively in both writings and orally when presenting cases in court or negotiating settlements. On the other half critical thinking and it was Lawyers to analyze multiple legal issues and develop initiative strategies for their clients, research skills are also useful and I enjoy researching a lot as I have already said they are there for uncover uncovering precedence that supports my clients position

25/08/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Francesca.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and submitting the SOP form, it is duly noted with us, I must say I really enjoyed listening to your introduction and how transparently you said that you love to argue because of which your school teacher asked you to join the debate team. May I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents?
25/08/23, 12:43 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Good afternoon.

Very sorry for this, it will nit be today.

Schools are out of session now and will reopen on 11th Sept. Today there was only the receptionist at the school...they have asked me to try again on Monday. I hope the needful person will be available. This would be the only delay.
25/08/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that @265991890028, In that case, we can wait for an update from the school till Monday, and when you are able to collect the documents on Monday you can share them, In the meantime, we can continue with our discussion, does this plan sounds acceptable to you?
25/08/23, 12:49 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: yes...very, thank you very much
25/08/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic interview questions, while we wait for the academic documents. The rest is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
25/08/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
25/08/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Francesca wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2023 intake?
25/08/23, 12:52 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: August intake may not be possible, so we were given a February intake
25/08/23, 12:53 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Because there is a problem at our immigration with getting passports
25/08/23, 12:53 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: but yes..the course is correct
25/08/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, Once you have applied for the Passport please do let me know, and I shall wait for your update for the JCE Letter on Monday.
25/08/23, 1:35 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: okay
25/08/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265991890028 I just had a conversation with your counselor and as per the conversation in your counseling session he mentioned that you want to join for the August 2023 intake rather than the August 2024 intake, There is only one Academic intake in the entire year and hence either you can join August 2023 intake or the one in next year. So accordingly please let us know and if you feel like you were informed otherwise then also you can share an update with me and I will look into the matter.
25/08/23, 3:02 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Someone had mentioned travelling in February.
I would prefer the Aug 2023 intake, but Malawi moves so slow...and Aug is already at the end, we may not be able to get a passport until late Sept or October
25/08/23, 3:03 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: But they also mentioned that she can be taking classes online
25/08/23, 3:03 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: until she arrives...
25/08/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, however, could you please help me with the name who mentioned the above statement?
25/08/23, 3:16 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: The one who called me....I had a call with someone, am so sorry I cannot remember a name, but let me find a number
25/08/23, 3:17 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: <Media omitted>

25/08/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
28/08/23, 1:56 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: hallo
28/08/23, 1:56 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: how are you today?
28/08/23, 1:57 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: we have exciting news, we may be able to get a passport very soon.
28/08/23, 1:57 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: also....who should the letter about JCE be addressed to?
28/08/23, 1:57 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Thank you
28/08/23, 1:58 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: This means it could be very possible to start this September
28/08/23, 3:14 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: <Media omitted>
28/08/23, 3:14 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: We have the school letter also
29/08/23, 9:39 am - +265 991 89 00 28: Good morning.
Is everything okay?
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: hallo...Francesca has a passport now...
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: We had to pay double the fees
29/08/23, 6:53 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 6:53 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Travel document
29/08/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Francesca.

I hope you are doing well, Kindly excuse me for the delay in response, I did have a conversation with the director Mr. Abhinav, and he briefed me that you have received your passport and I believe that you are ready to commence your admission for October 2023?
29/08/23, 8:01 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Good evening to you too
29/08/23, 8:01 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes I am ready
29/08/23, 8:28 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: yes
29/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, thank you for sharing the JCE letter, and the identity proof, it is duly noted with us. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Francesca wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the October 2023 intake?
29/08/23, 8:32 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Correct
29/08/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
29/08/23, 8:38 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes sure
29/08/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
29/08/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
29/08/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
29/08/23, 8:42 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: very right...🤣🤣🤣
29/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
29/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
29/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
29/08/23, 8:44 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: yes they did
29/08/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $1200-$1800 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
29/08/23, 8:47 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: understood
29/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
29/08/23, 8:48 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Understood
29/08/23, 8:49 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Clear
29/08/23, 8:49 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: clear
29/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 8:51 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: following
29/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
29/08/23, 8:51 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: No
29/08/23, 8:52 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: No
29/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion as a family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and then we shall reconnect Tomorrow at 01.00 PM to understand your and your family’s thoughts on your next steps and guide you on how you can begin with your university admission process. Along with that, I will also be helping you to start with your EWYL Program by Monday so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.

I hope you will be able to have a conversation with your family by then and ensure all of us are on the same page.
29/08/23, 9:00 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Thank you. Good night.
29/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great night.
30/08/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Francesca.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/08/23, 1:39 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: apologies, am driving,  Francesca is in class...May we connect later please...3pm?
30/08/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please drive safe. Let us reconnect at 03.00 pm.
30/08/23, 4:55 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: my apologies
30/08/23, 4:55 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: being month end, lots of traffic
30/08/23, 4:56 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: am free now, if you are. Or we can convene later at 8pm. You had said your hours were up to 4.30pm....
30/08/23, 4:56 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Very sorry
30/08/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I understand, our working hours are over for now, however, we can connect at 08.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
30/08/23, 5:00 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Yes...thank you
30/08/23, 5:01 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: later
30/08/23, 5:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
30/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/08/23, 8:28 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: available
30/08/23, 8:28 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes
30/08/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, before moving forward I believe you did have a family discussion so may I know if you want to share any queries or concerns?
30/08/23, 8:36 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: none
30/08/23, 8:38 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: we mostly focused on Francesca and if she is ready to travel overseas and be by herself
30/08/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process (enroll yourself at the university) and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
30/08/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship.

The universities usually take a few days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him a scholarship offer letter. In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due will be mentioned.
30/08/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is actually a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?
30/08/23, 8:40 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: we are on the same page
30/08/23, 8:41 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: go ahead...we are mentally and financially prepared
30/08/23, 8:41 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Same page
30/08/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
30/08/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university.
30/08/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they cannot take admission into that particular university for the current academic year, the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
30/08/23, 8:45 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: understood...but can they then later take foe the next academic year?
30/08/23, 8:45 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: And when paying this, it means then a place has been guaranteed...correct?
30/08/23, 8:46 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: and that for sure...she will be going? or are there other factors that can change their acceptance?
30/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed you are absolutely correct by paying to reserve the seat with the university admission is guaranteed. Please do not worry.
30/08/23, 8:48 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: okay...thanks
30/08/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome now in order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
30/08/23, 8:49 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: clear...mentally and financially prepared
30/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, as you are aware your registration fee will be between $500 to $750, to be on the safer side, let us assume your registration fee is $750. Once you get your offer letter, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your registration fee of $750 to reserve/lock your scholarship seat.
30/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For example, if you get your offer letter on 01st March 2023 and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, which makes the deadline for your fee of $750 15th March 2023 and hence you would have to make the payment of your fee before then. Are you clear on this?

*Please Note: The above-mentioned dates are an example and we will discuss the actual dates further.*
30/08/23, 8:51 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: very clear...15 days is more days than the 7 days given before...🤣
30/08/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear here. Now, as per our conversation with the students and the parents who completed their admission process early, they shared that with the current economic situation in African countries, it gets a little tough for the parents to make the payment of the complete fee of $750 in one part and hence considering the same, we had a conversation with the academic board and the university officials and came up with a solution to help reduce the financial pressure on the registration fee. 

I hope you are excited to know about the solution we came up with?
30/08/23, 8:53 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: super excited
30/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. Now, with respect to the conversation we had with the academic board and the university officials, we requested them to allow the students to make the payment of their registration fee of $750 in two parts of $375 within a span of 45 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.

However, Considering the urgency, you stated that you want to start with Francesca's university admission in October. In that case, we would have to fasten the process as a 45-day time span is a long time and after October we do not have any intakes for 2023. So I highly recommend having a thorough discussion with your family regarding the university registration process and the proposed due date of 10th September 2023. It is essential to ensure that everyone is aware of the time-sensitive nature of the situation. <This message was edited>
30/08/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, if you need more time to review your financial plans and determine when you'll be able to cover the registration fee, we’ll discuss that as well and we'll be happy to work with you to plan for your university admission accordingly.
30/08/23, 8:56 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: no..am good. I have a good support system if friends who can lend me money...and as you saw...some are outside and can be able to pay on my behalf
30/08/23, 8:57 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Is Sept 10 the due date or her admission date?
30/08/23, 8:59 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: sorry for moving too forward..when would she be expected to arrive in India
30/08/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, since we want to speed up the process as it will even be followed by the Visa process as well. So may I know will be mentally and financially prepared to pay the registration fee of $750 by the same due date which is September 10th, 2023?
30/08/23, 9:01 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: yes
30/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once we start with the Visa process, and once the university announces its official dates of arrival, we shall let you know, however, for a rough idea you can consider by the second week of October, please.
30/08/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know @265991890028 I believe you are satisfied with the discussion and are confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee due as per the tentative date shared which is September 10, 2023, so you can give us the (green light/go-ahead) to prepare your scholarship application and send it to the universities recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
30/08/23, 9:05 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: You may go ahead and start the preparations
30/08/23, 9:07 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: I do hope we will get a few offers so as to be able to choose...😁
30/08/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed you will, Amazing Parents and Francesca. As you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing your application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. 

Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for your higher education well.
30/08/23, 9:08 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Thank you
30/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
30/08/23, 9:17 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Good night....
01/09/23, 9:31 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Francesca!
I hope you all are doing well. 

*I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa*, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from MVN University, along with a remarkable 90% scholarship! Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨
01/09/23, 9:31 am - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have.

01/09/23, 9:32 am - +265 987 47 60 11: Thank you soo very much
01/09/23, 9:33 am - +265 882 96 87 00: This is great! Thank you very much for your support!
01/09/23, 9:44 am - +265 991 89 00 28: Wonderful, very thrilled. But please do not stop there...I would like to see other offers if possible, for comparison. 

Thank you so much for your hard work and effort.
01/09/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: noted
01/09/23, 2:42 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: Question: I don't see anything about food or meals....is that included or extra?
01/09/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please. I hope this is clear?
01/09/23, 3:23 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: okay
01/09/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
01/09/23, 3:32 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: this is clear and noted
01/09/23, 3:33 pm - +265 987 47 60 11: Clear
02/09/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Francesca!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/09/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier since I got occupied in an urgent meeting that came up unplanned. Now, I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
02/09/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
02/09/23, 8:49 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
02/09/23, 9:05 am - +265 987 47 60 11: Clear
02/09/23, 9:08 am - +265 991 89 00 28: clear
02/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
02/09/23, 9:47 am - +265 991 89 00 28: yes...but it depends, as you said, on the student working hard. 😁
02/09/23, 9:49 am - +265 987 47 60 11: Yes
02/09/23, 9:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the admission fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.

Hence, as per the offer letter you would have to make the payment of the admission fee of $1000 by 15th September. However, since you are aware that you are for the 2023 intake, therefore, in order to make sure that all the processes are completed in a timely manner and we can move ahead to the next steps iny our admission journey, it is important that you make the payment as soon as possible before the deadline. Is that clear?
02/09/23, 9:59 am - +265 991 89 00 28: I was hoping to see other offers and compare
02/09/23, 10:00 am - +265 991 89 00 28: This is just a first offer, as excited as we are...I would like to compare
02/09/23, 10:00 am - +265 991 89 00 28: we were told we would have to choose and select the one we best like.
02/09/23, 10:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Indeed, that is true. However, Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
02/09/23, 10:05 am - Milan Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here? <This message was edited>
02/09/23, 10:17 am - +265 991 89 00 28: Yes, I understood that. I dont know any universities in India, was just hoping to atleast have a choice.
02/09/23, 10:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please @265991890028 I understand that, stay assured I will help you in getting clarity with that. Now, As of now, your application has been only accepted by the MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
02/09/23, 10:20 am - +265 991 89 00 28: yes very clear
02/09/23, 10:20 am - +265 991 89 00 28: if this is the only one that has accepted..a.we wil pay b4 thr deadline
02/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
02/09/23, 10:20 am - +265 991 89 00 28: again from a UK or a USA account
02/09/23, 10:22 am - +265 991 89 00 28: We didn't know about the transfer..but that would be after she has arrived.
02/09/23, 10:22 am - +265 991 89 00 28: we will make sure not to miss out on this opportunity
02/09/23, 10:22 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

The transfer option will take place before Francesca will arrive here in India. Now, without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
02/09/23, 10:26 am - +265 991 89 00 28: wonderful...okay..thank you very much...understood
02/09/23, 10:27 am - +265 987 47 60 11: Understood
02/09/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, may I know if you are clear about the query that you had please?
02/09/23, 11:36 am - +265 991 89 00 28: yes...very clear
02/09/23, 11:38 am - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
02/09/23, 11:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due. The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, and since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Malawi, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a Telegraphic Transfer. Are you clear with this as well?
02/09/23, 11:46 am - +265 991 89 00 28: yes
02/09/23, 11:46 am - +265 991 89 00 28: it's the same account we paid the $350 fee
02/09/23, 12:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right. Alternatively, you can make the payment of the registration fee through PayPal as well. For that, may I know if you have a Nostro Account or a VISA/MasterCard with you?
02/09/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: no
02/09/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 89 00 28: we will pay b4 the 15th.
04/09/23, 8:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Francesca!
I hope you are doing well today.
04/09/23, 8:55 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
04/09/23, 8:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that, however, before we come to discuss that, can you please also let me know of this?
04/09/23, 9:08 am - +265 991 89 00 28: I don't have a PayPal account
04/09/23, 10:37 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, in that case, you can also make the payment of the admission fee directly through International Bank Transfer to the details mentioned in the offer letter.
04/09/23, 10:38 am - +265 987 47 60 11: Okay
04/09/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we move ahead with our conversation here?
04/09/23, 10:47 am - +265 987 47 60 11: No
04/09/23, 10:48 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -

19/09/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1225*2 = $2450
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $4325.
19/09/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1225*2 = $2450
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150

The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.

19/09/23, 10:51 am - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

Once we receive an update from the university regarding your bona fide letter, we will reconnect with you and share the information. This will enable you to complete the visa application form and plan your visit to the Embassy.
20/09/23, 12:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, there are certain things that you can do before we start with the VISA application. So, please complete the below-mentioned steps, and then we will connect back when you complete the steps to proceed with your VISA Processing.
20/09/23, 12:02 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *List of Visa Requirements -*

20/09/23, 5:55 am - +265 991 89 00 28: Thank you....does the itinerary have to be a return ticket? if so, what would be the ideal return date?
when we buy the ticket, would we have to get a return ticket?

Will she need to be escorted? or can she travel on her own?
20/09/23, 5:55 am - +265 991 89 00 28: She didn't do A levels...but an equivalent of O levels, would this be a problem?
20/09/23, 5:59 am - +265 991 89 00 28: what should the tentative departure date be?
20/09/23, 9:11 am - +265 991 89 00 28: Is a birth certificate really necessary?
20/09/23, 12:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You need a one-way ticket for the visa process, and not a return ticket. When we talk about an itinerary ticket, it is a dummy ticket and would cost you around $5. It is used to show your intention to travel abroad and is hence a crucial requirement. The flight ticket will be booked after you secure your visa. The arrival date for the itinerary ticket should be either 26th September 2023 or 4th October 203, depending on which one is more convenient for you and your family.
20/09/23, 12:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: She can travel on her own; there's no need for an escort. Regarding her educational qualifications, if she has completed an equivalent of A levels, it should not be a problem. However, if possible, could you share a copy of her A-level results with us?
20/09/23, 12:30 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, attending your last query, if you do not have a birth certificate, that is fine. You can use any other identity proof, such as your National ID or passport, as an alternative.
