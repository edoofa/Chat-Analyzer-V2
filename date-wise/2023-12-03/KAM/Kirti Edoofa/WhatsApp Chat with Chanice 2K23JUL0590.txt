I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelor of Physiotherapy and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024.

18/10/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay..i remember
18/10/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I'm sorry I can't recall
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 235 1224: You mean stage by stage
18/10/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, the stage as well as the brief of what we discussed?
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I think we were done with stage 3 and was added in the group of Earn While You Earn
18/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I have a question..after studying in India will i be accepted in other countries,to work there
18/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you will be since the Indian bachelor's degree is accepted worldwide.
18/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ohh ok... thank you
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay thank you😊
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I have
18/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Chanice, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ohh ok
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
18/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
18/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Everything is clear
18/10/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Normally, universities have their registration fee paid before you have gotten the admission or after
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 235 1224: You can provide me with more information
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is true, and for normal universities, the registration fee and the tuition fee are two different amounts, however, here at Edooda, this registration fees to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
18/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok
18/10/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I guess
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Or use O level results
18/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 235 1224: But that's basically it
18/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
18/10/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Oh ok ok
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 235 1224: No
18/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
18/10/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok thank you
18/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Have a blessed day
07/11/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted

08/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 235 1224: But then it says Mr Chanice, i am a female
08/11/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for noting that out Chanice, it might have been a technical error from the university, however, please do not worry. I have updated the team regarding the same and we will get the letter updated.
08/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay thank you
08/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Im done going through it
08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok thank you
08/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok
08/11/23, 4:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 4:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 235 1224: 1 $900
2 4.5 years 9 semesters
3 $300
4 $750
08/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct, and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a 4.5 -year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 9 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
08/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 5:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ohh okay , understood
08/11/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
08/11/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
08/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes i am
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
08/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes we are
08/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a *$150 grant* applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes thank you
08/11/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Im in Marondera
My Parents in Macheke
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok thank you
08/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes
08/11/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
08/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok thank you
08/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now Chanice, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
08/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay thank you
08/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
08/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
08/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
08/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
08/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes i have
08/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
08/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
08/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
08/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes it does
08/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
08/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
08/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Everything was clear
08/11/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that your are all clear. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
08/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
08/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
08/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
08/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
08/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities.

08/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay thank you very much
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday 14th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
08/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay , thank you
08/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will be connecting on the 14th since we have one of the biggest festivals coming up *Diwali*, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
08/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 235 1224: That's nice
08/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Have a wonderful time during Diwali
08/11/23, 6:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your wonderful wishes. Have a great day ahead!
14/11/23, 4:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chanice.

I hope you are doing well. As we were to connect today on the 14th, I have scheduled our discussion today at 08:00 pm CAT, I hope you will be available to connect with us at that time.
14/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok
14/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 235 1224: How are you
14/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes i am
14/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
14/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 235 1224: The money needed we don't have it
14/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 235 1224: And also it raises a concern..for we might pay but end up not studying there
14/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 340 4508: Good evening Ms Kirt  hope you are well... we have very poor network connection on our side...can we proceed with our discussion and we will reply as soon as we received the msg
14/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that network can be a challenge that is alright please you can respond when you are connected to a stable network
14/11/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts transparently with us, may I know why is that you think that you might not want to study in India?
14/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I meant study at the University
14/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 235 1224: There are still a lot of universities to be considered.. isn't it so
14/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
14/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability
14/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
14/11/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias Univerity and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
14/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes i am
14/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
14/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Im not
14/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
14/11/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 235 1224: So i won't pay any registration fee , to the university..when changing
14/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are absolutely correct, however, this is only possible if you secure your seat with the current offer letter that you have.
14/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok..will discuss with my parents
14/11/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
14/11/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I have no questions
14/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
14/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes i did
Searched on its rank in the country
And some programmes done there
14/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
14/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
14/11/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

14/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 22, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you? <This message was edited>

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents.

16/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay..im sorry had an exam yesterday

16/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 235 1224: It was difficult😅
16/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you have given your best and you will secure good grades.
16/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Thank you
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

16/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Now available
16/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you were able to discuss this with your family?
16/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes was able to
16/11/23, 3:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know  which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
16/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ma'am, the amount needed is too much for us considering that our family is not "wealthy" enough to provide that money before the due dates
And they were saying they already have some expenses to cover as it is year end
 So ,that is it
I hope you will understand
16/11/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I understand that completely, however, in that case, I would like to know since you were aware of the fact the $750 registration would be required for your admission process since the month of July, may I know what back up plan have you considered?
16/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 235 1224: What do you mean ,what back up plan
16/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 235 1224: And ma'am if i am correct ,you hadn't really specified the amount
16/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please elaborate on your statement here, as to which amount are you referring to?
16/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 235 1224: $750
16/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Registration fee
16/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know what specified details are you referring to since here I clearly explained how you will be able to pay the registration fee?
16/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Umm ma'am.. you had said we knew about the $750 registration fee since July
16/11/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please if you recall our conversation in the month of July you were shared the breakdown of cost and made cleared about the registration fee as well may I know if you recall please?

16/11/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please in reference to the fact that you were aware of the registration fee, may I know how have you utilized these months for your admission process?
16/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Honestly ma'am you are confusing me

20/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 235 1224: No
20/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ma'am,right now we don't have the money so we have no choice🥺
20/11/23, 4:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you are aware of the same, could you please help me understand how much amount have your parents raised for your registration so far and how much will they be able to raise before the 22nd?
20/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 235 1224: They said they haven't raised any money..this side things are tough..

21/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 382 1254: And it's a short notes
21/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713821254 I understand, however, could you please help me understand how have you raised till now because tomorrow is the first deadline for Chanice and and if you miss this deadline tomorrow then I will not be able to assist you since Chanice will lose this opportunity.
22/11/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chanice.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?

23/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 382 1254: Let's carry on with our communication
23/11/23, 4:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. May I know if you were able to go through the message I shared above?
24/11/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chanice.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, you did not respond may I please know if we are still in communication?
24/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I am here
24/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yes i managed to
24/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now that you have a better understanding, I would like you to help me understand, as to what are your parents plan for your higher education?
24/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 235 1224: What do you mean ,when you say plan?
24/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 382 1254: I'm not able to pay that amount as now...the economy in Zimbabwe is not stable yet.. Plans will come next year in terms of Chanice's higher education
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 382 1254: We are running short of cash at the moment
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713821254 I understand what you are trying to say here as a parent and it is true that the economy is not stable right now, and that brings me to my same point. Given the current economic situation in Zimbabwe, the challenges you're experiencing now could be a part of Chanice's life in the next 10 years if she stays there. On the other hand, if she secures admission, performs consistently in the EWYL program, and completes her education in India, her future could be considerably brighter.
24/11/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: And that is why I am trying to help you here, even after the deadline is crossed because I do not wish for Chanice to lose this opportunity, so could you please help me understand the amount that you have been able to raise so far and the amount you will be able to raise by the 29th of November so that I can have a discussion with the academic board for you and help come up with a payment plan for you?
24/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 382 1254: I hear what you're saying....I was working in South Africa, now South Africa government refused to renew our permits that forced me to relocate in Zimbabwe were I'm busy looking for a job so that a I can raise money for my kids to keep on going with their education...to have all the job requirements here in Zimbabwe it needs cash and also money for tips.

I am assuming to be well financially settled by next year
24/11/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand the challenge that you have been going through to help me have a better understanding, could you please let me know by next year according to you when will you be all settled to assist Chanice with her higher education?
24/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 382 1254: End of January... I think everything will be okay on my side
24/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier. I was occupied with a meeting which was then accompanied by my dinner break, I would love to answer your concern and move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
25/11/23, 8:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Chanice.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, with regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to continue with our discussion ahead may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 382 1254: Yes I'm available
25/11/23, 9:06 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that since you mentioned that you will be all settled financially by next year January I would like to know what plans you have in mind for yourself, are you thinking of a new job or opening a new venture, which makes you think that you will be all settled up within the next two months?
25/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 382 1254: Self employment... It's not easy to start but when you are in the system everything thing will flow nicely
25/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I understand, could you please help me understand what venture are you planning to start?
27/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chanice

I hope you're doing well and you had a great weekend I was hoping to get a response,since we were not available yesterday because of the weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
27/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Yah
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if your father was able to go through my message above?
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I think so
27/11/23, 5:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are aware about his venture idea so that I will be able to assist you?
27/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 235 1224: He will tell you when he is certain😊
27/11/23, 8:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772351224 I will only be able to assist you if you are willing to connect with us to have a proper discussion, please. Over 225 students have already secured their scholarship seats, and only 9 seats remain for the current round of applications, set to close on November 30th and I will not be able to assist you with your offer letter after this, please?
27/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ok ma'am,what can we do when we don't have the money
Will you be able to pay for us
27/11/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772351224 I am sorry that can not be possible however, I can definitely have a discussion with the academic board and for that, I would like to know how much will you be able to raise by 30th November, please?
27/11/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I would say nothing.. because currently speaking my father has no job
27/11/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772351224 may I know if your father would be able to raise $100 by connecting with some relatives or friends who are willing to help?
27/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 235 1224: In 3 days
27/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3 days will be exactly the 30th of November and we will be able to assist you since the round of applications closes on the 30th of November, so may I know if you are certain that you will be able to raise the $100 on the 30th of November?
27/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Was saying in 3 days ,..its a short time
27/11/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know how will you be able to raise according to you within 3 days?
27/11/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I don't think we will be able to
27/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772351224 may I know what challenges are you facing see I will not be able to assist you if you are not ready to take a step ahead for your higher education?
27/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I think the only option is to just let the opportunity slide . We can't give ourselves pressure and stress when we know we don't have the money
So yeah ... thank you
27/11/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ma'am this money needed is to be paid for Galgotias right...
27/11/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. If you believe that letting the opportunity slide is the right decision for your higher education, you can indeed choose that path. Our primary aim has been to assist you in securing your scholarship seat, ensuring you have access to better resources and receive the quality education you aspire for. However, we cannot accomplish this without your input in your admission journey as per the timelines shared by the university.
27/11/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 235 1224: That's why im saying will let the opportunity to go there slide since we don't have money for now
There are still a lot of universities to consider in India
27/11/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the beginning of your sessions, we made efforts to guide you regarding the financial requirements you will need in place post-August 2023 when we will share your application with the universities. 

Unfortunately, it seems our previous discussions did not yield the expected results, and you find it challenging to secure your scholarship seat.
27/11/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Its not like we don't want to secure a seat..but we don't have the money and nothing can be done ...and it seems you are not understanding and think we are just being stubborn when its not the case
27/11/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In this situation, I am uncertain about how you wish for us to assist you, given that we've already tried to offer a flexible payment plan. If you believe that you cannot commit to that as well, regrettably, our options may be limited, and we may need to let this opportunity pass, potentially compromising your educational goals.
27/11/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 235 1224: What if you pay for us and letter on deduct the money when paying for my tuition fee when ,at least i would have already been enrolled
27/11/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Ma'am the thing is we have had a lot of discussions with many mentors we tended to forget
27/11/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772351224 we understand that navigating the deadlines set by the university is challenging and that is the reason we have worked hard to help you with the Endowment Benefits. Over here, no one perceives you as stubborn, please excuse us if you feel the same way. However, it is also important to acknowledge that we, too, are bound by the timelines imposed by the university, which we must adhere to. While we genuinely wish to assist you, certain aspects are beyond our control.
27/11/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is important to recognize that you are not working to secure a standard admission abroad, rather you're aiming to secure a scholarship. This is something that involves global competition, and hence, we and the universities have to ensure fairness to every student in the process.
27/11/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Scholarship abroad is a unique opportunity for the student and we have worked extremely hard for you to have access to the same. I am sure you can understand that the challenge you have is not uncommon, many students across Africa encounter similar obstacles and, despite them, they have managed to realize their dreams of pursuing education abroad. I am sure that is something you too wish for yourself <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: There is no doubt that the goal we have is the same and all we want is to help you get the right opportunities. In the end, we are educators, and our work is to help you with the opportunity, securing the opportunity is something that needs your assistance. If you have challenges, we can certainly help you navigate those challenges, but if you don't meet halfway in working through these challenges, our options are limited and I am not sure what can be the best way forward.
27/11/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 235 1224: It's alright
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Chanice.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us?
28/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Im.sorry i had an exam today
28/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, how was your exam today?
28/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication since the university closes the round of applications on the 30th of this month and I will not be able to assist you after that?

29/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now while I was going through your application again I understand your challenges. While I empathize with you, you have to understand that you have applied for an International Scholarship, and there are certain rules of the scholarship that must be respected. Students all over the world are competing for this scholarship opportunity, and while we wish to assist you, the university has to be fair to reach every student.
29/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Considering that you are a student under the Edoofa Program, and we have made a promise to help you secure your scholarship seat, we can once again have a discussion with the university officials and see what can be done to allow you an extension until 28th December to secure your scholarship seat. However, given that you have also been granted the Endowment Grant of $150, it might not be possible for you to retain all the benefits.
29/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In such a case, I believe as a parent, you have to make a decision. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 28th December, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $150, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, sir, that cannot be done if you do not understand the importance of these due dates. <This message was edited>
