25/10/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for connecting with you yesterday, due to a national holiday known as Dusherra, and the other name for the same is known as Vijayadashami, which is a major Hindu festival celebrated in India. It marks the victory of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The festival is observed with various cultural and religious activities, including the burning of effigies of Ravana, elaborate processions, and the worship of Goddess Durga. Dussehra typically falls in September or October and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and fervor across the country.
25/10/23, 11:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
26/10/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tapiwanashe,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. Yes, please I had a great time with my family. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
26/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Yes please sorry for the delay .I was out with work and there was no network. I am now available. Please go ahead.
26/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that work can make life busy. May I know if you are clear so far?
26/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Very clear mam
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
26/10/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Thus food and accommodation will be provided provided the student paid for the two is it?
26/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the cost I shared above includes the food and accommodation, however, more food and accommodation options will be available, as we move ahead with our discussion in Step 5 we shall discuss them
26/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Ok thank you. You can therefore proceed
26/10/23, 4:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
26/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Understood thank you mam May I ask yet another question . Will the EWYL programme for Tapiwanashe continue after her exams? I ask with the fear that university admission may be early before full participation in her EWYL projects (which were suspended due to exams and her credits are likely to be low for now.?
26/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the EWYL program will continue after her exams please, and it is alright she must have low credits now, but she will surely work hard and improve her credits.
27/10/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
27/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Yes mam . Afternoon mam . You can go ahead . Thank you
27/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now, however, I will be now be heading for my dinner break so let us reconnect at 08:00 pm CAT today. <This message was edited>

27/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Greetings mam. Now available . I had been at church service sorry
27/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
27/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
28/10/23, 2:46 am - +263 78 317 8669: Glad to hear that mam.Thank you
30/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if your parents are available to connect with us now?
01/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Afternoon mam . Sure we are available .Thank you
01/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
01/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
01/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
01/11/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing from you, but considering that it has been a long day for me and our working hours have now ended, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow. I hope you'll be available then.
01/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Ok mam. Will reconnect tomorrow. You were not connected when I was online .Good night
02/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tapiwanashe.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Afternoon mam. Thank you .I am now connected. I am back from work. Please go ahead.Can you shade more light on point no 3(Availing an endowment grand of $150 on university registration fee due)
02/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we shall discuss the endowment plan in detail now.
02/11/23, 5:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
02/11/23, 5:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tapiwanashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
02/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Understood mam
02/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
02/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
02/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Yes please
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Well resonated please .You can proceed
02/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
02/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
02/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 20, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
02/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 78 317 8669: No the explanation is clear. Thank you go ahead
02/11/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Yes please you can provide me with more information but bear in mind that the A-level results would be out by end of February 2024. By then however the assessment would have been done. So it's best that you explain for us .Thank you
02/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
02/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Clear mam
02/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
02/11/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Yes please
02/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
02/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Sure very clear
02/11/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
02/11/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
02/11/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 317 8669: It's clear mam
02/11/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
02/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Yes please but what is the duration for a diploma course?
02/11/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A diploma is a 3 year course.
02/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 317 8669: ok
02/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
02/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Ok understood mamal
02/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 317 8669: mam
02/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 317 8669: No question mam.Thanks
02/11/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Tapiwanashe's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tapiwanashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
02/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Yes please
02/11/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. However, we would only be able to share Tapiwanashe's applications to the universities when you will be sharing the academic documents, so may I know by when will you be able to share the academic documents?
02/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Ok I still remember academic documents for Tapiwanashe being sent sometime back . Or else they are submitted again? Could you highlight please
02/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, however, since we connected a long time ago due to technical issues, those documents are not available so please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

03/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 317 8669: <Media omitted>

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
03/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Ok mam. Thank you

11/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
11/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
