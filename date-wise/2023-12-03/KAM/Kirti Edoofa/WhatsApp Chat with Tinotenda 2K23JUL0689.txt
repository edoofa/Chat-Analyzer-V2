31/07/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Waiting for this message
31/07/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I have now almost fully recovered. Maybe tomorrow if nothing goes wrong l will be discharged. I could not respond because l had developed acids. I was dehydrated weak joints heavy breathing no appetite . I was in my own world. Today they have taken my last tests to check for TB due to the heavy coughing. Chest x-ray was done. COVID tests all done. Hope to be home tomorrow. Will send a pic
02/08/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

I hope you are doing well, I am glad to hear that you are discharged from the hospital, and I wish you a speedy recovery and get healthy soon, that is alright, whenever you are comfortable taking the discussion forward we can go ahead, I understand that completely that you can get sleepy due to the pills.
02/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Yes we can start tonight
02/08/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great to know that, let us reconnect today at 09.00 PM.
02/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Sure
02/08/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tinotenda, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I am now available. Sorry l had not checked earlier.
02/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know how are you feeling now?
02/08/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I am feeling much better thank you
02/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now if you are available shall we start with our discussion?
02/08/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 508 9219: sure
02/08/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
02/08/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
02/08/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
02/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 508 9219: That is right. Only one university.
02/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
02/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
02/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
02/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Yes ww talkes about it. But l had believed that the payment and acceptance letter would come not earlier than when the final A Level results are out. That is what l had understood.
02/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Is that so
02/08/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand @263775089219 Since your year of intake is 2024, and as for your A-level, you will be appearing for that this year and so your A- level statement of entry along with your O- level will be enough for the universities to generate your offer letter.

I hope we are clear here?
02/08/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 508 9219: ok l get you
02/08/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
02/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Yes that l understood.
02/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
02/08/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Very clear except that the deadline is too little considering  our economy in Zimbabwe and the life of a civil servant.
02/08/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775089219 I understand that, however, every university has its own deadline period, and since your admission year is 2024, your registration process will start after August, so you will have ample amount of time, please do not worry.
02/08/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Ahh if it so them its ok. There will be ample time to   prepare.
02/08/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, Now as your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l am following.
02/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
02/08/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Not much. Just hoping it will not come sooner than i can pay.
02/08/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, since your registration process will start after August 2023 for a rough idea you can consider that it will stretch till mid-September or early October. Also, once you start with your EWYL Program, you can learn and earn too. So please do not worry you have ample amount of time.
02/08/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 508 9219: But when the letters of acceptance will you be in to help me choose.
02/08/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Sure. Thank you.
02/08/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 508 9219: come🖕
02/08/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, we will help you assist, and discuss the letter with you in detail and help Maluba choose the university according to his preference.
02/08/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 508 9219: That is great news indeed.
02/08/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
02/08/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Lets go for it.
02/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night, let us reconnect tomorrow.
02/08/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Thank you.🙏
02/08/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
03/08/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotenda.

However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Tinotenda's higher education?

I trust you are in good health. Thank you for sharing the academic document. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress?

19/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, the discussion would take 1 hour of your time if you are available actively.
19/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l am now ready
19/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Computer Science) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 508 9219: True and accurate
19/10/23, 4:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Yes l recall these processes. Thanks for the chart
19/10/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 508 9219: If l am not mistaken, that is the stage where we are now. Ypu now need to send info about Tinotenda to different universities to see whicj one will avcept him. Once accepted a letter of acceptance will be send which will help in prcessing the visa etc
19/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?

19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 4:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Thank you very much for thos assuarance. I am eargerly waiting. And lm sure when he is done with hos exams he will beore than happy
19/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l will be waiting
19/10/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Done. l have reviewed the nenefits
19/10/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tinotenda, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Ok. l am following through. I hope all will work positively
19/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Umm well said and encouraging and pleasing
19/10/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Excellent
19/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Thanks to Edoofa
19/10/23, 5:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l understand
19/10/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l think l woud need more information
19/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
19/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
19/10/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
19/10/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Yes l am npw clearer
19/10/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 508 9219: right
19/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l umderstand
19/10/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 6:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
19/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Clear
19/10/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
19/10/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
19/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l  am clear
19/10/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
19/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 508 9219: ok. l get it
19/10/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 508 9219: No questions
19/10/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Tinotenda's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that tinotenda is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Very much excited
19/10/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Ok. Good day
06/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Hallo there.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I have gone through the letter amd l understand that Tinotenda has been awarded 50% scholarship. I have to pay to bw reserved a seat at the univwesity an amount of $300us within a period of two weeks. Howwver thia letter cannot be used to secure a visa. Lessona will begin in September 2024 and commence for 3years
15/11/23, 5:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263775089219 Thank you for your proactive understanding, however, please be assured that as we move forward with our discussion. The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 508 9219: That is fine by me thank you.
15/11/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 508 9219: ok
15/11/23, 5:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I shall wait for your response to the above questions.
15/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 508 9219: 1. 50% whoch os 900us
2. 3years
3. 300us
4. 750us
15/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 508 9219: The tuotion fee is wwll clarified
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I dont understand what you mean by go for accomodation independantly. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand. Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 12:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Tinotenda,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?

16/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I will write down my questions
16/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please we can connect today at 05:30 pm.
16/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 508 9219: My question is How far away from the university is the off campus accomodation?
Secondly, the 750us to be paid in advance is it part of the fees and is it the same coming with the offer of paying only 600us if paid early. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Is the off campus accomodation comfortable for learners.
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Does the campus accomodation have to be paid in full or in batches
16/11/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and ill be answering your concern tomorrow to assist you let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow.

20/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l am available

Moving forward I would like to inform you that as we start with our discussion I'll help you understand the letter if at the end there is any query that is unattended then we can cater to that as well. So may I know if you are available to start with the discussion?
20/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Sure we can start
20/11/23, 6:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
20/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Not quite. I just wish to know if the off campus accomodation is close to the university oraybe there are buses from the university to ferry students to the university at a reasonable fare.
20/11/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The off-campus accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well?
20/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Now clear. Will the off campus rooms provide basic things like stoves refridgerators etc or students can buy food or meals somewhere
20/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
20/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
20/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Wonderful
20/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Yes this is satisfactory
20/11/23, 7:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me know when you are able to go through this message above please.
20/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I am clear on this
20/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
20/11/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 508 9219: So far so good.
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Sure. Go ahead.
20/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I understand. We are in agreement
20/11/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I reside in a small town called Rusape
20/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 508 9219: ok
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/11/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Needmore Maphosa for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 508 9219: sure
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share the same:

20/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 508 9219: got it
20/11/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
20/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l understand
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 508 9219: l have clearly understood
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Yes l can understand the advantages of the program
20/11/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that tinotenda will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/11/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 508 9219: So far so good
20/11/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
