This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.

01/12/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
01/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 168 2406: Yes it's clear
01/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 168 2406: During the sessions we mainly focused on how the Edoofa program is there to help Adonis through his education journey.  They explained how it is possible to earn while he learns. They further explained that us as parents will be required to cater for his accommodation and food that is if he earns enough credit to cover his tuition. Further They explained on how the program equips Adonis for his career by him being attached to some companies.
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 168 2406: They also took their time to explain why India is the best place to learn as it some major CEOs have studied in India. Overally They explained the benefits of the whole program

It's fantastic to hear about the emphasis on supporting Adonis's education journey and the multifaceted approach the program takes.

The Earn While You Learn initiative appears to be an essential aspect that not only aids in financial support but also instills a practical learning experience, which is invaluable. Understanding that aspects like accommodation and food are parent-supported, while Adonis can focus on earning credits for tuition, provides a clearer picture of the program's structure.
