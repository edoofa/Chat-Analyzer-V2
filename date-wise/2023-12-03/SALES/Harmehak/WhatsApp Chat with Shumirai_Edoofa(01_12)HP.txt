You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

02/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words
02/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
02/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes that's  every child's wish
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Shumirai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
02/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay ,firstly  my name is  Shumirai Gotami aged 19.Apparently I'm  waiting  for my form 6 results. I was doing  mathematics, physics  ,chemistry  and statistics at First Class High School .My wish is to  do Structural  engineering at one of your universities.My sources of strength  are  the current situation here is Zimbabwe and l'm not someone who  easily gives up.My greatest  weakness  is that I'm  more concerned about my studies and nothing else .Always  being  updated about what is happening  around the world is one of my hobbies as I'm  someone who is eager to  learn more.   





I'm the first born  in a family  of  4. We are from Gutu but we stay in Mutare .My father is a Central Intelligence  Officer and my mother is self employed. The highest  level  of education for my father  is  tertiary  education  after attaining a degree in ICT and for my mother  is A level. One of my siblings is doing  ordinary level and the other two are still  at primary school
02/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Shumirai, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

I can see you come from a family that is great lead by your parents.
02/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: It's great that you have a thorough clarity on what you want to study as well.
02/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 796 7593: It is  also my pleasure to  be chatting  with  you  and knowing  more about Edoofa
02/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I am glad,

Are you aware that Edoofa is proudly associated with your school as well and we have students who would be coming to India and who are currently in India from you school as well?
02/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes
02/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great

02/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I am
02/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Sharmaine
02/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Well Sharmaine now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 796 7593: It is  a great  life changing  decision
02/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Indeed  it  is because  not everyone  gets  this opportunity
02/12/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Very well put across,

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Shumirai?
02/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes I'm more than prepared
02/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great 

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
02/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes they are aware and also willing to  support as they believe  that education is  the  key to success
02/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Good evening Shumirai,

Kindly excuse the delay due to a technical challenge.
02/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive and I appreciate their thoughts.
02/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
02/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 796 7593: It's okay..don't worry
02/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I am ma'am
02/12/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: That's great
02/12/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: So Shumirai, you happened to mention your interests in doing Structural engineering,

May I know what motivates you to opt for the field? <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay  ma'am  .....after completing my studies  I  would  have a high chance of  quickly  finding  a job
02/12/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: That's a great thought,

Do you have anyone working in this field?
02/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes my uncle
02/12/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So Shumirai, I would like to share with you that Structural Engineering and Civil Engineering are the terms which are used interchangeably.

So shall I first brief you about your desired course so that you have a better understanding?
02/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes ma'am  I really  need  your  help
02/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
02/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Ma'am  can you also  give me more information  about  structural engineering
02/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Because  I'm  confused  between  civil  and structural engineering
02/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: Shumirai, Civil Engineering and Structural engineering are terms that are usually used interchangeably please.
02/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay
02/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*
02/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Structural Engineering is one of the dedicated Masters field that a student can specifically pursue after completing Bachelors please.
02/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay ma'am  l now understand.Thank you
02/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

Do you have any queries for me as of now?
02/12/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 796 7593: No ma'am
02/12/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
02/12/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same please?
02/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Same ma'am
02/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I have another question
02/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 796 7593: What are the requirements  for someone to  do civil  engineering
02/12/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
02/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 796 7593: In terms of  subjects
02/12/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics please.
02/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay ma'am
02/12/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: So shall we proceed ahead, Shumirai?
02/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes
02/12/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Shumirai, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
02/12/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I see myself  as  a very successful  person who is self dependent  ,someone  who is able  to employ  and not being employed
02/12/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 796 7593: India  is well  known  for offering  the best education opportunities  comparing to  other  countries  so l believe that studying in India will  equip me for a better  job as an engineer
02/12/23, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Shumirai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/12/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Honestly  speaking in the case of India,l have always wanted  to  visit  India .It have been  a dream to study there ever since  I  was  a  kid . Outside the country there is great  exposure  that a person gets to learn  a lot comparing  when  studying in Zimbabwe
