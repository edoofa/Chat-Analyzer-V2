02/12/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: Alright so Trust, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
02/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 343 0144: I sat for my O Level exams(ZIMSEC) from mid October to end of November this year. I was seating for 18 subjects.I am more concerned with studying public health sciences with intention to become an epidemiologist. I wish to study until I become a professor.
I am a self-motivated with a couple of self help books and videos. This gives me a sense of high encouragement to become what I want to be. I am serious with my studies, day and night,non stop. I always have a strong belief in what I want such that nobody can grab me from my road to success.
My biggest weakness is that I end up wanting to try everything I no one wants to help me in my path to success. I hate non influencers such that I end up isolating myself if such people are around me.
I love reading motivational books during my spare time.
02/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 343 0144: There are four members in my family.My father works as a taxi driver in Harare. My mother stays at the rural home as a housewife. My father makes visits to the rural home after three months.
