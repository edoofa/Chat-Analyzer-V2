*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

So where do we start
01/12/23, 11:34 am - Sagar changed the group name from "Kelvin Chafachaipa_Edoofa(31/10)SM" to "Kelvin Chafachaipa_Edoofa(31/10)GS"
01/12/23, 11:36 am - Sagar: Alright, so Kelvin, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tanyaradzwa, is that correct?
01/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 405 4903: Yes it's correct
01/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 405 4903: Sorry couldn't get your message in time. Was at school
01/12/23, 2:38 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tanyaradzwa, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tanyaradzwa’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
02/12/23, 2:04 am - +263 71 405 4903: Tanyaradzwa never told me anything about Endoofa.
02/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: Noted.
02/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: Let me brief you about the program myself.
02/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
02/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
02/12/23, 9:37 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
