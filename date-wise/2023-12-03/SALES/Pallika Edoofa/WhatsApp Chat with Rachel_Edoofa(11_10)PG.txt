I was expecting your response, but it seems you are currently occupied, so I will have to schedule your session for Monday at *08:30 am CAT on Monday (23/10/2023)* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so I can respond in the morning. 

Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
Meanwhile, you can go through this video of an Edoofian sharing experiences. <This message was edited>

27/10/23, 9:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Rachel, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program

02/12/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

02/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 875 6065: What preparations are needed to be done
02/12/23, 11:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: Rachel I was asking about your financial preparations as Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
02/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 875 6065: Yes
02/12/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright!!
02/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Rachel Considering your financial conditions, as your father has to manage your an dyour siblings school expenses, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
