30/11/23, 9:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Mr. Edward,
How are you doing?
30/11/23, 9:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was hoping for a response, May I know are you facing any challenges? <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 9:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hello Nigel, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
01/12/23, 12:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
01/12/23, 8:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Nigel, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Saturday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
