02/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 263 3622: My father was an Engine man at the National Railways of Zimbabwe and my mother is a housewife. So having a father as an engineer had an impact on my interests and aspirations. It instilled a passion for problem solving and a strong interest in Maths. Meanwhile, having a mother as a housewife taught me the importance of attention to detail and the value of hard work. That's why l have an interest in Risk management
02/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your father's role as an Engine man at the National Railways of Zimbabwe has fueled your passion for problem-solving and a keen interest in mathematics, thanks to his engineering background.
