Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
15/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

17/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 962 7232: I am good at figures, that is calculating and that is why i chose Pure mathematics and Accounts in my current A level combination.

So by doing so i researched about programs that are offered to this particular area and Accounting was the one that caught my eyes. 
Accounting have so much closure in calculating at the same time being a businessman. By calculating an Accontant can be able to do so because he records transaction and able to calculate profits made by a business. Also by being a businessman an Accountant is able to help a business in decision making through giving ideas to a business on sales needed to exceed expenses to make profit and so many.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
17/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Yes i am more than willing to put my 200% hard work and i am also willing to take all opportunities that come my way in order to transform my career, as long as it have good motives torwards everyone and the economy.
17/11/23, 5:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
17/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Yes I am so confident. So A level passes are only A grade or.

Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
17/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
17/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Here in Zimbabwe they provide education that is not that better comparing with the abroad level of education. Also i want to experience more of abroad education, advanced technology and jobs by myself. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 7:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 962 7232: I have done research on foreign education but i have never applied to any university abroad

18/11/23, 10:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
18/11/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 962 7232: Yes
18/11/23, 10:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
18/11/23, 10:52 am - +27 74 676 1601: Morning sir
18/11/23, 10:52 am - +27 74 676 1601: How are yu
18/11/23, 10:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
18/11/23, 10:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
18/11/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 962 7232: When i researched it says about 1.6 lakhs, but i did not understand.
18/11/23, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
18/11/23, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
18/11/23, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 11:08 am - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
18/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 71 962 7232: Ok i understand now
18/11/23, 11:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
18/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 962 7232: Ok sir, thank you for more clarification
18/11/23, 11:25 am - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief  you about the Earn While You Learn program?
18/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 962 7232: Yes of course
18/11/23, 11:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
18/11/23, 11:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/11/23, 11:32 am - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
18/11/23, 11:40 am - +263 71 962 7232: Ok sir
18/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 962 7232: It is really clear, thank you sir
18/11/23, 12:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
18/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 962 7232: On my view i think it is will actually help me because it students ready to a certain industry and also a student can be fed with some information and help before even he graduate. I think it's very helpful.

18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Yes sir it is
18/11/23, 12:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 12:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
18/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 962 7232: I understand that Edoofa have 6 stages in order to complete the scholarship. Firstly Edoofa will engage in Personal Counselling Session where a student is being guided on career choices.
Secondly they will engage into the second stage of Eligibity Check Test and Interview. This were student will be interviewed and put into tests. The results of the second stage will determine wether the student is accepted or not. If accepted then that will engage into the third stage of Acceptance into Edoofa Program. Then the student will be enrolled into the Edoofa Program and that will be the fourth stage of the cycle.  The stage 5 is when admission process took place after tge enrolment and if the admission goes well then move to the last stage where a student is given the admission letter and the visa to reach India. With this stages the cycle will be completed.
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee.
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalmentsm thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
18/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Ok sir understood
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
18/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
18/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 962 7232: I find the Earn While You Learn very interesting because it benefits the student with knowledge and preparing a student to the real world and at the same time students earn scholarship credits in the process ehich will further reducing the cost of education. Very interesting.
18/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Also Edoofa stay with students throughout the journey of Higher education.
18/11/23, 1:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
18/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 962 7232: My parents
18/11/23, 1:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
18/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Yes you did
18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
18/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Ok so it's not part of the tution fee?
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
18/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Ok sir
18/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Understood
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 962 7232: Ok sir
18/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
18/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.

18/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Excellent, Attempt, Let me sum it up for you. So that you are clear with all the information
18/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills.

In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

TOPIC: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

In Rwanda genocide gives effects which even by now is affecting the country. It was the planned mass killing of one another. This gives hatred between neighbour and neighbour, relatives and everyone was an enemy to each other.
In 16 years after the genocide in Rwanda, survivors and their families continue to present with considerable rate if PTSD (a real disorder that develops when a person has experience or witnessed a scary, shocking, terrifying or dangerous event) and substantial depressive and anxiety symptoms. The data revealed a strong association between health problems and psychosocial factors such as social intergration.
Many women suffered the consequences of rape and sexual violence. Thousands of children were orphaned and had to fend to themselves. Countless survivors developed long-term psychological problems. However, over time Rwanda rebuilt itself and survivors played an important role in its development.
Families were decimated, and the mass killings caused physical and psychological damage to survivors. The genocide devastated the country, destroying homes and communities. Among the survivors, 75000 were children who lost one or both parents. 
In 16 years after the genocide Rwanda has face a problem in their economy. Rwanda has made significant progress in rebuilding and developing since the 1994 genocide. However, the small and landlocked country of nearly 14 million people faces many challenges which includes inflation and high unemployent rates. This is the other reason why poverty rate is high in Rwanda. Despite its impressive economic growth over the past decade more than half of Rwandas live below the poverty line. 
World Vision began working in Rwanda, providing life-giving emergency aid, helping resettle displaced people and caring for children who have lost their parents. The communities are rebuilt. In 16 years after the genocide the Rwanda people has to fight inorder to settle some issues such as economic issues and reconcile after the genocide.

SECTION 6
"MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY"

Growing up i have been a person who received so much help, knowledge, wiseness from my parents and also from knowing God. Being a beliver of Christ have made me a person who is humble at times and not intersted in violent events such as fights and others. I have more support from my parents in whatever i need to do in my lifeand i always thank Jehovah for giving me parents who are able to support me in every way they can. They made me understand that i should never give up in any dreams because God is always helping me.
When i was young, my parents had to force me to study and at that time i viewed that as they were troubling me but in time to come i could see by my own that i should pull up my socks my myself and try to reach my goals. By doing this i have been able to reach better grades in my education. School can be difficult at some time but with my vision of my future i always have to wake myself up and face the difficulties. My life have been a miracle since i was in Christ, being able to cross some stages  and God's help also make me focused. Since i was a child my dreams were for me to be able to get better education and be a succesive businessman, to help the economy to grow in some way and at this moment it feels like the Lord is answering my prayers. 
I have played cricketsince grade 5 to form 2 and i stopped because of COVID afterward i started playing chess with my schoolmates but we have go to competition because our school does not have a chess club. I really love these to activities they make me happy. I am also good at soccer i never tried to be in a school team.
My parents always say that a bright future needs a good foundation, so i am trying to give my all to build that foundation that will be something at some future date. I do not have much to say but i always thak God, my parents and my siblings for always being available for me in every circumstance.

26/11/23, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: Would you like to ask anything from the Letter of Acceptance please?
26/11/23, 11:17 am - +27 74 676 1601: Yes sir.on the second page at first paragraph point of nmber 3..about registration which can be adjusted from 1000 to 500..is it under the scholarship or its me who is going to pay so that i must get prepared in time
26/11/23, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: You would have ample amount of time for that part of the fee @27746761601, meanwhile let me brief you what it means by adjustment in first year's annual fee please!
26/11/23, 11:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: Say suppose, after the scholarship your fee is $2200, and you are being asked to pay $500 as a registration fee.

Now, being an Edoofa Applicant you have the privilege here of the registration fee being adjusted against your Tuition fee.

Hence the amount of $500 paid as registration fee will be waived off from your Fee and after that, the balance of ($2200-$500=$1700) has to be paid after coming to India in August/September of the year you come in 2 installments. The first part will be $1000 which you will pay in August 2024-2025 and the remaining $700 in January 2025-2026.
26/11/23, 11:27 am - +27 74 676 1601: Ok sir.i realy understand.thank you for good explanation
26/11/23, 11:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: What else would you like to ask please?

26/11/23, 11:58 am - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
26/11/23, 12:28 pm - +27 74 676 1601: Option nmber...1.
Can you explain for me rhat one
26/11/23, 12:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain
26/11/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @27746761601, talking about the first mode, which is the Direct Bank transfer in our Account, basically because of the cash crisis in Zimbabwe, there are a limited Banks which allow International Transfer. These Banks are Barclays Bank and CBZ Bank, Nedbank and FBC Bank. If you have an account in any of these Banks then the transaction charges will then be $100 to $120 USD for any amount upto $1000 depending upon the bank. Please note that $350 should also be in USD. In case you have Zimbabwean Dollars, you will have to exchange that with USD and transfer charges on *every transaction* would also be $100 to $120.

Therefore, the Bank Details that are to be used in this mode are:

Swift code: AXISINBB207
IFSC code: UTIB0001147
Bank Name: Axis Bank Ltd.
Account Name: Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
Current Account Number: 917020070183626
Bank's Name:  Axis Bank Ltd.
Bank’s Address: Janakpuri, B Block, New Delhi[DL]
Ground Floor & Basement, B-1/503, Janakpuri, New Delhi 110058

26/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @27746761601 from South Africa you can directly complete the formalities using Mama Money.
26/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Shall I brief you about the same?
26/11/23, 2:21 pm - +27 74 676 1601: Yes sir please if you have the idia becouse i did ask mr kawadza unfortunatly he is not yet comeback to me.This is becouse i want to see the one with bater charges so that anyday from tomorrow i can do the paymen since now its weekend

27/11/23, 6:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning @27746761601
27/11/23, 6:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: Through FNB bank you can complete the formalities directly into the Indian Account using the first mode.
27/11/23, 6:53 am - Shubham Madhwal: For transfer charges you would have to enquire the Bank for the same. However if we talk about Mama Money, you can complete the formalities using the same, as our Account's team would generate an Order for it and you would just have to visit the Mama Money agents to complete the formalities
27/11/23, 12:18 pm - +27 74 676 1601: Ok sir thank you so mch.
