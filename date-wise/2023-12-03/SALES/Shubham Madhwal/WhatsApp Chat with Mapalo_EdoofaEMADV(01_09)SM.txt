 Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
13/09/23, 9:31 am - +260 97 7546277: Indeed
13/09/23, 9:51 am - Sagar: Mapalo, let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!

Shall I brief you about this course?
13/09/23, 10:04 am - +260 97 7546277: Yes
13/09/23, 10:07 am - Sagar: B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology : What is it about?

*B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society. Sociology is a branch of study which investigates multiple aspects of society and social behavior which helps them to do social work.

Affordable Fees Structure. ...

13/09/23, 12:48 pm - +260 97 7546277: This is exciting
13/09/23, 12:49 pm - Sagar: May I know if you understood everything properly?
13/09/23, 12:49 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes i do
13/09/23, 12:58 pm - Sagar: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
13/09/23, 1:06 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes
13/09/23, 1:07 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
13/09/23, 1:07 pm - Sagar: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/09/23, 1:07 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 1:09 pm - +260 97 7546277: Ok its reasonable
13/09/23, 4:48 pm - Sagar: Excuse me for the delayed response and I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night

14/09/23, 9:32 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

_"Each day comes bearing its gifts. Untie the ribbon."_

 Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
14/09/23, 9:46 am - +260 97 7546277: We can proceed
14/09/23, 10:10 am - Sagar: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
14/09/23, 10:12 am - +260 97 7546277: Ok this is inspiring
14/09/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/09/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
14/09/23, 10:35 am - +260 97 7546277: This is a good program
14/09/23, 10:49 am - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
14/09/23, 10:49 am - Sagar: 1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

14/09/23, 10:49 am - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
14/09/23, 11:06 am - +260 97 7546277: In so many as outlined in your last post as it will enhance quality life skills in relation to the line of course
14/09/23, 11:16 am - Sagar: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/09/23, 11:16 am - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/09/23, 11:16 am - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
14/09/23, 11:27 am - +260 97 7546277: That's rightly out lined  and will endeavour to do more in EWYL so that i can earn more points
14/09/23, 11:38 am - Sagar: Alright Mapalo, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
14/09/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 7546277: That's right
14/09/23, 12:42 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
14/09/23, 1:06 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes
14/09/23, 1:10 pm - Sagar: Mapalo as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/09/23, 1:11 pm - +260 97 7546277: Somewhere around $1500 to $2500
14/09/23, 1:13 pm - Sagar: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/09/23, 1:13 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 1:14 pm - +260 97 7546277: Thats great news
14/09/23, 1:17 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
14/09/23, 1:18 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes i do it actually makes it easier for the students
14/09/23, 1:19 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/09/23, 1:20 pm - +260 97 7546277: Ok
14/09/23, 1:21 pm - Sagar: @260977546277 can you share your Grade 12 results?
14/09/23, 1:22 pm - +260 97 7546277: Iam in Grade 10 at the moment
14/09/23, 1:27 pm - Sagar: Chileshe, may I know by when would you be sitting for your Grade 12 exams?
14/09/23, 1:28 pm - +260 97 7546277: In 2025

14/09/23, 1:42 pm - +260 97 7546277: Can i do a diploma course then

14/09/23, 1:55 pm - +260 97 7546277: Sociology

18/09/23, 11:56 am - Sagar: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
18/09/23, 12:44 pm - +260 97 7546277: India has highly rated institutions and is knows for academic excellence world wide

18/09/23, 12:57 pm - +260 97 7546277: This interesting i hope to achieve the best results so that i can also move to that level
18/09/23, 1:00 pm - Sagar: May I know if you understood everything properly?
18/09/23, 1:02 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes i did
18/09/23, 1:03 pm - Sagar: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
18/09/23, 1:09 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes they do
18/09/23, 1:26 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
18/09/23, 1:26 pm - Sagar: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
18/09/23, 1:26 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 1:31 pm - +260 97 7546277: Ok its quite reasonable
18/09/23, 1:54 pm - Sagar: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
18/09/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7546277: I have ready in the previous correspondence
18/09/23, 1:59 pm - +260 97 7546277: Have read in the previous conversation
18/09/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
18/09/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
18/09/23, 2:02 pm - +260 97 7546277: That's excellent
18/09/23, 2:07 pm - Sagar: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
18/09/23, 2:07 pm - Sagar: 1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
18/09/23, 2:07 pm - Sagar: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
18/09/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 7546277: Very much cos i will able to work had so as to earn points and raise money for my upkeep and other requirements
18/09/23, 2:14 pm - Sagar: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/09/23, 2:14 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/09/23, 2:20 pm - +260 97 7546277: Exactly this is what am hoping for
18/09/23, 2:24 pm - Sagar: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.
18/09/23, 2:25 pm - Sagar: Alright basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
18/09/23, 2:28 pm - +260 97 7546277: That's correct
18/09/23, 2:33 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/09/23, 2:34 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes
18/09/23, 2:42 pm - Sagar: Mapalo as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/09/23, 2:47 pm - +260 97 7546277: Around 1500-1800
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - Sagar: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 2:50 pm - +260 97 7546277: That's manageable
18/09/23, 2:50 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
18/09/23, 2:51 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes indeed
18/09/23, 2:52 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/09/23, 2:52 pm - +260 97 7546277: Ok
18/09/23, 2:52 pm - Sagar: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you
above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/09/23, 2:52 pm - Sagar: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/09/23, 2:54 pm - +260 97 7546277: Ok that's great
18/09/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
18/09/23, 2:56 pm - +260 97 7546277: Yes i have its a matter of putting more effort in studies
18/09/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared
18/09/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
18/09/23, 2:57 pm - Sagar: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/09/23, 3:01 pm - +260 97 7546277: Correct
18/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sagar: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sagar: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025).
18/09/23, 3:10 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
18/09/23, 3:11 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 3:11 pm - Sagar: Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
18/09/23, 3:14 pm - +260 97 7546277: Ok well tabulated thanks
18/09/23, 3:17 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
18/09/23, 3:18 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/09/23, 3:19 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

26/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
27/09/23, 4:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hi, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.
