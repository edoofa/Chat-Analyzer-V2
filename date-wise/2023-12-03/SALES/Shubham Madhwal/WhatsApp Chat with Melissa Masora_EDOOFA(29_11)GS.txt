29/11/23, 10:16 am - Sagar: Good Morning Melissa, and Mrs.Lynda  Banda!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 465 6458: My network is down sorry for the late reply
29/11/23, 2:58 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Melissa, I understand,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Ok that's 👌great
29/11/23, 3:05 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Melissa, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Virginia, is that correct?
29/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Yes that's true
29/11/23, 3:16 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Virginia, also do tell me whether you learnt about Virginia’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 465 6458: I learnt that ENDOOFA is reliable and supportive to it's students
29/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: I see you are well informed.
29/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: Let me also brief you about the program.
29/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Sure it is
29/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 465 6458: This is awesome
29/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sagar: Okay so Melissa, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Yes
29/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sagar: Alright so Melissa, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

29/11/23, 3:55 pm - Sagar: Noted.

Therefore our Academic Board would also take the remarks on your academics and extracurriculars from your school, required in the process
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - Sagar: Can you please share the name and contact of your School Headmaster/Head Mistress to receive feedback regarding the same?
29/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Ok wait a moment
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 465 6458: I guess I will collect tomorrow after school
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Sagar: Noted.
29/11/23, 4:07 pm - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Electric engineering, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
29/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 465 6458: What motivated me is that  this job high paying and longevity of the job (endless job )
29/11/23, 4:12 pm - Sagar: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
29/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Yes my Sister and she is working in South Africa
29/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sagar: Now I would like to know that if you wanted to do electrical engineering, why did you take subjects of commerce?
29/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 465 6458: My school does not offer any other combination besides commercials and arts so l had no choice
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 465 6458: I got a flyer from someone with the Principal's number so can l send the picture
29/11/23, 4:19 pm - Sagar: Yes you can send that.
29/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 465 6458: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: Well after this you have two options, Melissa.
29/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 465 6458: I chose the commercials
29/11/23, 4:23 pm - Sagar: One is that you can follow your interest and do a Diploma in Electrical engineering based on your O-level results.
29/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Yaaa
29/11/23, 4:23 pm - Sagar: The other one is to do *Bachelor of Business Administration or BBA*.
29/11/23, 4:24 pm - Sagar: Now what would you like to choose?
29/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Ok l can take the second option and l would like to know more about BBA and the advantages
29/11/23, 4:27 pm - Sagar: Noted.
29/11/23, 4:27 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 4:27 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
29/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Yes l am
29/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 465 6458: That's true
29/11/23, 4:29 pm - Sagar: That is great.
29/11/23, 4:29 pm - Sagar: So should I brief you about the course.
29/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Of course yes

30/11/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 8:36 am - +263 71 465 6458: Morning
30/11/23, 8:38 am - Sagar: That is really great Melissa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
30/11/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 465 6458: Yes why not
30/11/23, 10:30 am - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
30/11/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 465 6458: Of course! There are several reasons why I would prefer to study abroad rather than in my own country. Firstly, studying abroad would give me the opportunity to experience a different culture and way of life, which would broaden my horizons and help me to develop as a person. Secondly, studying abroad would allow me to gain a global perspective on my chosen field of study, which would be invaluable in my future career. Thirdly, studying abroad would allow me to build a global network of contacts, which could open up opportunities for me in the future. Finally, I believe that studying abroad would allow me to challenge myself and push myself out of
30/11/23, 10:44 am - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

30/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Hmm  this is good
30/11/23, 4:08 pm - Sagar: Melissa, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Sure
30/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sagar: Alright Melissa, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
30/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Yes
30/11/23, 4:17 pm - Sagar: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
30/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Yes we discussed about it
30/11/23, 4:22 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
30/11/23, 4:48 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 465 6458: Same applies @919540301963
01/12/23, 8:03 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 8:30 am - +263 71 465 6458: Morning
01/12/23, 8:44 am - Sagar: So let us continue the session now.
01/12/23, 8:45 am - Sagar: Melissa as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
01/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 465 6458: Ok
01/12/23, 9:41 am - Sagar: Please address the question.
01/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 71 465 6458: I should fill an application letter right
01/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 465 6458: Wow, you clearly have a lot of insight into the application process for studying abroad! So let's break down the math. If a student applies to 5 universities and the average cost is $350 per application, that would be $1750 total. That's a pretty significant amount of money to spend, especially without any guarantee of acceptance. And that's not even considering the cost of actually attending the university if the student is accepted. What do you think could be done to improve this process and make it more affordable and accessible for students?
01/12/23, 9:47 am - Sagar: Let me explain how we improved it.
01/12/23, 9:47 am - Sagar: Melissa, you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
01/12/23, 9:48 am - Sagar: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 9:48 am - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
01/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 71 465 6458: I'm impressed by your knowledge of Edoofa's services! It sounds like they are offering a comprehensive and cost-effective solution for students who are looking to study abroad. The "Earn While You Learn" program is especially unique and interesting, as it provides students with the opportunity to offset the cost of their education by earning scholarship credits. Do you think this model could be successful in attracting more students to study abroad
01/12/23, 10:05 am - Sagar: Melissa, can you please elaborate, on what do you mean by being impressed from my knowledge of Edoofa's services, I am a career counsellor at Edoofa and have already helped tens of thousands of students, so yes I have the knowledge. I want to express that it seems the answer is plagiarised, I would want to know the concern, if that is the case.
01/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 465 6458: No that's not the case
01/12/23, 10:27 am - Sagar: It is good if that is not the case.
01/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 465 6458: Yeah
01/12/23, 10:30 am - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
01/12/23, 10:30 am - Sagar: Melissa, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
01/12/23, 10:30 am - Sagar: However Melissa, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 465 6458: Ok wow this is nice
01/12/23, 10:37 am - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
01/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 71 465 6458: Noo
01/12/23, 10:39 am - Sagar: Alright Melissa, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
01/12/23, 10:39 am - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
01/12/23, 10:39 am - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
01/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 465 6458: I got it
01/12/23, 12:03 pm - Sagar: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
01/12/23, 12:03 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
01/12/23, 12:03 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
01/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 465 6458: No
01/12/23, 12:19 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/12/23, 12:19 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
