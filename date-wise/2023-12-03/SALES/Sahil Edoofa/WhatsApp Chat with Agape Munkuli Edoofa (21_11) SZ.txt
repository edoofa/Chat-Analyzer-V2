I served as a prefect at fatima when I was in form 4

I trust you will conduct further research into the course.
21/11/23, 4:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Agape. I believe you must be familiar with the fact that *Edoofa* strongly recommends *India* for higher education! May I know what is your knowledge of India and the Indian Education System?
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 036 3800: I know India as a peaceful country and loving people as I have seen in movies 
 I think Indian education is one of the best as we have seen some CEOs of big companies like Microsoft originate from India

Looking ahead, I'm confident that you acknowledge *Edoofa's* unwavering dedication to delivering top-notch university education, empowering students to attain their career aspirations and secure a promising future.

I assume you are acquainted with the expenses associated with obtaining a similar quality of higher education for an international student without access to a scholarship. Additionally, I trust you have insights into the overall cost of education in India, correct?
21/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Yes
21/11/23, 5:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your comprehensive understanding of the cost of education in India, please?
21/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 036 3800: $350 to be paid within 7 days 
But U can pay $200 within 7 days 
And the reminder in 30 days
21/11/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 036 3800: 2 . Fees ranges from 
$ 2000 to $ 3000 
Because of edoofa's 50 % schoolarship 

Without schoolarship it ranges from $6000 to $ 8000
21/11/23, 5:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! I am truly flabbergasted by the fact that you have comprehended so brilliantly, Agape! However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
21/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Thus wonderful
21/11/23, 5:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Agape. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

May I know what is your knowledge or understanding about the *Earn While You Learn* programme, please?
21/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 036 3800: On the earn as you learn program I only know that you get to work while you still doing your studies
21/11/23, 5:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
21/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Yes sir
21/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
21/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
21/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
21/11/23, 5:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

21/11/23, 5:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
21/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Yes l understand that through hard work l can greatly reduce the burden on my parents, a thing that l am determined to do if given the opportunity
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Agape. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
21/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 342 6039: We are more than excited. It's a dream come true for us and our children
21/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I'm delighted to learn that Mr. Munkuli! Pursuing international studies can significantly fast-track his career advancement, opening doors to lucrative job prospects that would empower him to financially support his family independently. This, in turn, promises a tranquil and worry-free life for his parents!
21/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
21/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 342 6039: It's true sir
21/11/23, 5:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
21/11/23, 5:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

21/11/23, 5:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
21/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 342 6039: Understood
21/11/23, 5:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
21/11/23, 5:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 342 6039: Clearly comprehended sir
21/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

21/11/23, 6:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this message?
21/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Yes I acknowledge it sir
21/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly tell me which stage you are at in your application right now?
21/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Stage 1 for now
21/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
21/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Yes sir
21/11/23, 6:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
21/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 036 3800: Yes it's clear sir
21/11/23, 6:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Is there anything else you would like to inquire about or any other questions I can help you with?
21/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 78 036 3800: No it's all clear
21/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Agape!
21/11/23, 6:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was a pleasure to host the session with you today!
I am content with your responses and performance so far as a result, let me promote your application to Stage 2 of the Edoofa Cycle. Congratulations!!👏🏼👏🏼.
