09/11/23, 3:03 pm - +27 78 396 5117: My name is Sarudzai Gutai

Single mother to Timothy Mushaikwa

I work as a vendor in Johannesburg South Africa so that I can fund my child's education.

Basically I'm a small business entrepreneur.

Timothy being my only child I invest in his future as well as His Education. Mainly because of how hard working he has proven to be and the potential I see in him from his early age till date. 

Currently he lives in Zimbabwe with my Brother and his wife whilst I work in South Africa. I try to visit atleast once a year to see them. 

As far as being a student is concerned Timothy is very Obedient, Punctual and a respectful Child and also works hard towards his Academics and extra curricular activities like playing chess, soccer as well as being a member of their environmental club at his school. 

I've never had problems with Timothy Since he was growing up till today and his Guardians too vouch for him. His a god fearing child who attends and participate at church. His kind loving and caring. He is a social Person who is able to interact well with other's and his peers too. At primary he led the school as Head boy I was very of him for this judging from the fact that he was a foreign in his school. Currently he is the President of his Chess Club
09/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That sounds impressive, Mrs. Sarudzai. It is truly commendable that your parents indulge in entrepreneurship! I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Timothy. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. I admire your ability to rise above adversity with grace and determination! Furthermore, Timothy seems to embody admirable qualities—he's not just a bright student, but a compassionate, social, and responsible individual. Leading as Head Boy and now as the President of the Chess Club reflects his natural leadership skills and ability to connect with others. It's wonderful to see him actively participating in church activities, showcasing a well-rounded and grounded personality
09/11/23, 7:36 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Yes  sir I hope I did not leave out any Crucial details you expected to Hear?
09/11/23, 9:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>

10/11/23, 11:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You have done a wonderful job of describing everything vividly, Mrs. Sarudzai! So, could you kindly tell me how much *Kuwadzana 2 High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports Timothy's education?
10/11/23, 12:04 pm - +27 78 396 5117: This message was deleted
10/11/23, 12:05 pm - +27 78 396 5117: I am paying 115 dollars per term and am the only person who is responsible for Timothy's  education fees and some school stuffs since my brother is not financially stable bcoz he is taking care of his family and our late brothers kids also
10/11/23, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am truly sorry to hear about your brother, Mrs. Sarudzai. I hope God will provide you with the strength to fight through adversity.
10/11/23, 12:19 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Amen God always have his way to make things happen
10/11/23, 12:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Timothy's education abroad?
10/11/23, 1:07 pm - +27 78 396 5117: In a case that his scholarship with EDOOFA is successful I will be assisting him or rather Financially supporting him up Until he is able to stand on his own feet

I also hope that he gets to earn whilst he study through your program
10/11/23, 3:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Mrs. Sarudzai! You will be glad to know that we offer a distinctive program that allows students to engage in internships and self-finance a significant part of their fees while completing their coursework. I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses. <This message was edited>
10/11/23, 3:45 pm - +27 78 396 5117: I'm glad to hear that. I'll be waiting to hear from you Sir
10/11/23, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to guide you through the process, Mrs. Sarudzai. You are an extraordinary parent, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Timothy's well-being is truly admirable!
10/11/23, 5:07 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Thank you Sir

It is my role as his mother to be there and support him whilst I'm still alive
10/11/23, 5:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with the course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind sending your son abroad for higher studies? Moreover, please share pictures of his previous qualifications results for evaluation. Also, please mention the year of completion of A level?
10/11/23, 6:34 pm - +27 78 396 5117: I believe sending my  child abroad will be beneficial to him and that he will get quality education with all the resources needed as compared to here in Zimbabwe.

And if he succeeds in going out it will be a great achievement to me because I know he will work hard and bring back home the knowledge he would have acquired abroad and help in Changing the lives of others in the community. As well as living a better life.

Like any other parent out there I'm looking forward to seeing Timothy taking care of me even much better than I do through if he studies abroad
10/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mrs. Sarudzai! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!

He is a Boy who is keen into the medicine world so much that even once to do Sciences at Form like I have mentioned before.

*"An investment in knowledge pays the best interest." - Benjamin Franklin*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
14/11/23, 12:42 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Morning sir yes am ready
14/11/23, 1:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Sarudzai!
14/11/23, 1:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Mrs. Sarudzai. I appreciate your sincerity!
14/11/23, 1:30 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Yes my day was perfect sir, thank you
14/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mrs. Sarudzai, could you please share why Timothy didn't pursue Physics in his A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science/medical subject, isn't it?
14/11/23, 3:49 pm - +27 78 396 5117: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 3:50 pm - +27 78 396 5117: At his school they are not allowed to do four subjects. But the main reason was that he did not pass Physics at O'level the main reason being that he took the Sciences at a later stage
14/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
14/11/23, 4:07 pm - +27 78 396 5117: The thing is that in Zimbabwe even if you have Math's, Biology and Chemistry you can still do medicine
14/11/23, 4:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, having a background in Math, Biology, and Chemistry in Zimbabwe still allows individuals to pursue medicine. However, it's important to note that there are challenges regarding the recognition of medical qualifications obtained in Zimbabwe in some foreign countries. Obtaining a license to practice medicine abroad might pose difficulties due to differences in accreditation standards.

On the other hand, India is recognized globally for its medical education, and individuals who pursue medicine in India often find their qualifications accepted and respected internationally. India has a well-established infrastructure for medical education, and it is a leader in the field. Many people from Africa, including Zimbabwe, choose India for medical services due to the high standards and quality of healthcare.

While Zimbabwe may have competent healthcare professionals, the global recognition of medical qualifications and the infrastructure for medical education and practice may vary. The decision to pursue medicine in India might be influenced by the international recognition of Indian medical degrees and the quality of medical education and healthcare services provided in the country. <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 5:34 pm - +27 78 396 5117: I acknowledge that too and it is our wish that Timothy get's an opportunity to persue Medicine in India.

But in a case that he scores good points in his final does he still stand a chance to do medicine in India under the help of Edoofa?
14/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Sarudzai. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Timothy's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
14/11/23, 6:02 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Yes
14/11/23, 6:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that he could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
14/11/23, 6:09 pm - +27 78 396 5117: 6,7,8

May we please get more information on them
14/11/23, 6:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Sarudzai. May I know which course intrigues you the most, please?
14/11/23, 8:08 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy
14/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Physiotherapy
*Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
14/11/23, 9:52 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Okay thank you for the information.

So if he get's 15 Point's straight

Pure Mathematics - A
Biology - A
Chemistry - A

What are his chances of getting enrolled in medicine?
14/11/23, 9:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, Mrs. Sarudzai.
14/11/23, 9:55 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Oky thank you sir
14/11/23, 9:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with Timothy's career aspirations?
14/11/23, 9:58 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Okay okay it makes sense now

Math's is not even a mandatory subject
14/11/23, 9:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Sarudzai. Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics are intrinsic for medicine.
14/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Students who indulge in Mathematics and Physics often take Engineering as a career.
14/11/23, 9:59 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Oooh oky l understand now
14/11/23, 10:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Sarudzai. Can you please acknowledge this question?
14/11/23, 10:01 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Okay

It's going to be difficult to divert but I believe he'll have to do what his A level Subject's permit him to do
14/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have any other course in mind, please?
14/11/23, 10:02 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Yes surely it does
14/11/23, 10:04 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Not any I believe the course's that are in the Medicine field will do
14/11/23, 10:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 10:08 pm - +27 78 396 5117: Thank you Sir stay blessed too
15/11/23, 11:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." – Sam Levenson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
17/11/23, 11:27 am - +27 78 396 5117: Morning sir yes we can start
17/11/23, 11:31 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Sarudzai!
17/11/23, 11:35 am - +27 78 396 5117: Yes thank you sir
17/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 490 2395: I believe studying in India will give me or rather open doors for me to excel in my line of work with the quality education I would have got from India.

The aim is for me to work for the Government but with time I aspire to open my own establishment. (me studying in India will be an added advantage when looking for a job due to the quality education offered in India
17/11/23, 11:57 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
17/11/23, 11:59 am - +263 71 490 2395: Not exactly Sir

But I believe it will be quit expensive
17/11/23, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Timothy! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
17/11/23, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
17/11/23, 12:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
17/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Well in a case that I get the Edoofa scholarship I personally believe the reduced fee is reasonable and affordable but that'll also mean I have to hear from my mother in terms of her average yearly income.
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Yes sir my family will be able to afford
17/11/23, 1:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Timothy! Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
17/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Yes you can Sir
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Timothy. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
17/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Yes Sir I believe this EWYL programs will be beneficial to me

Personally I would try to venture into the Creative Content Creation field
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
17/11/23, 7:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

17/11/23, 7:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
17/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Indeed Sir and I have seen how beneficial it is to both Student and parents
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
17/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 71 490 2395: 1.Affordability through guaranteed scholarships
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
17/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 490 2395: From what I know they fully support that Idea because they know I will get quality education and experience

That is why I am being fully supported through the scholarship application process
17/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
17/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
17/11/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Yes Sir I believe that's what is required.

Not forgetting the visas, English tests and results too. Isn't it?
17/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
17/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
17/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

18/11/23, 9:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled." - Plutarch*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/11/23, 9:19 am - +27 78 396 5117: Good morning sir am sure Timothy now went to church
18/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 490 2395: Good morning Sir we may proceed with the sessions
18/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 490 2395: Edoofa really is a life saver because all of these costs are just too much
18/11/23, 9:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Timothy and Mrs. Sarudzai!
18/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 490 2395: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 490 2395: Indeed Sir hope yours is going well too
18/11/23, 9:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am doing fine as well, Timothy. Thank you for acknowledging!
18/11/23, 9:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
18/11/23, 9:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 490 2395: Okay Sir this is understandable
18/11/23, 9:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/11/23, 10:02 am - +263 71 490 2395: Well Edoofa helps us African students pay the 350 in an extended period of time.

And also it helps through the EWYL program to make sure a student can use the points to help reduce the cost fee
18/11/23, 10:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
18/11/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 490 2395: Alright Sir I've understood all the financial cost's
18/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 490 2395: May we please continue with the sessions later because I have to attend church now
18/11/23, 11:21 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Timothy. May I know when will you be available for the session, please?
18/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 490 2395: I'm done now we may proceed
18/11/23, 8:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Timothy!
18/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Still loading the network is kind of tripping
18/11/23, 8:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Timothy. I will be waiting for your response.
18/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Timothy Mushaikwa Edoofa (07/11) SZ" to "Timothy Mushaikwa Edoofa (07/11) SZ 2025"
18/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 490 2395: We've discussed everything but I believe we are at stage 1
18/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Yes Sir
18/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
18/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Yes Sir I'm following
18/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/11/23, 9:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

18/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.

I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.

20/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Yes we can
20/11/23, 3:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
20/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 490 2395: Not yet Sir but indeed her story is motivational
20/11/23, 7:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can connect today
20/11/23, 7:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?


7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
