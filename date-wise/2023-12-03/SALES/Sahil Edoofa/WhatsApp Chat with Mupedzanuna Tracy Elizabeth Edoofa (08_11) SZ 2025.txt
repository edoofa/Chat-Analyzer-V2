Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
16/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes but I'm not sure
16/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please feel to share, Tracy.
16/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Fees: $3000 per year
Accommodation:$65/$90 per month 
Food:$70
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tracy! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
16/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
16/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes...it is
16/11/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tracy. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
16/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tracy. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
16/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 647 4953: On my view EWYL program it is very important because they gain knowledge and are able to pay their own  fees which is an added advantage to parents

Yes it will be
16/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
16/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
16/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
16/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

16/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
16/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes..thank for sir for guiding me
16/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
16/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 647 4953: 2,3 and 4
16/11/23, 9:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Tracy! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
16/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 647 4953: 4
16/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tracy. One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back! So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
16/11/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 647 4953: They will be proud of me and l will be used a good leader to my young sister    and brother
16/11/23, 10:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents. Furthermore, I believe that you will act as a beacon of resilience to your siblings if you capitalize on the appropriate opportunities!
16/11/23, 10:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
16/11/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Ok
16/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
16/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
16/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*

16/11/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Ok..thanks
16/11/23, 10:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
16/11/23, 10:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
16/11/23, 10:51 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Ok
16/11/23, 10:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
16/11/23, 11:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 6:07 am - +263 78 647 4953: I understand that the Edoofa scholarship can give you financial means. Additionally can help you to cover the cost of living expenses while you're in school  and Edoofa trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found eligible for the program this cost includes remaining tuition fees,basic university expenses,food and accommodation.$2000-$3000 the cost of education per includes tuition and other expenses,this cost is paid in two equal installments.90-100% scholarship you will only need to pay minimal fee ranging from $1 200-$1 800 which cover whole expenses
17/11/23, 6:07 am - +263 78 647 4953: In addition,Edoofa helps students arrange and pay their finances by themselves through EWYL reducing the semester fee as well and  earn scholarship credits reduce the financial pressure on parents
17/11/23, 11:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Mupedzanuna Tracy Elizabeth Edoofa (08/11) SZ" to "Mupedzanuna Tracy Elizabeth Edoofa (08/11) SZ 2025"

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
17/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes you can
17/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
17/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yeah...l understand it
17/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
18/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Morning and how are you sir
18/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes we can proceed
18/11/23, 12:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
18/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes...it goes  well
18/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
18/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Not yet so far
18/11/23, 6:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Its okay you can connect today
18/11/23, 6:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

19/11/23, 11:10 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Ok
20/11/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Afternoon, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 647 4953: How are you sir
20/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 78 647 4953: We can start
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
20/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 301 4718: Afternoon sir ,I am Ms Chivange Linah ,Tracy,s mother.Am very much pleased with your discussion with my daughter.
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 25 th or 26 th November 2023 for $200 and the 25 th or 26 th of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 25 th or 26 th of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 301 4718: The problem is so far I am not yet financially prepared but am much concerned about the programme.
20/11/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263773014718 can you elaborate your challenge so that I can help you out please?
20/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 301 4718: Since Tracy is completing her lower  six this year  I thought next year will be prepared since she will be completing her upper six
20/11/23, 7:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Tracy's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways

*1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:-* Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, *Persistance Muza* the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

*2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:-* Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

*3,  Having the benefit of the Community:-* This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
20/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 301 4718: Understood now,bt I will manage to get the total  payment in December as$350.00
20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You only have to pay first part this month
20/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 301 4718: I don't think I will meet the deadline for the first part
20/11/23, 7:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing for now so that I can help you ?
20/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 301 4718: I have already spent November salary not knowing that deadlines are close
20/11/23, 7:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Tracy, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Tracy's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
20/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 301 4718: Yes,please
20/11/23, 8:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Tracy's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tracy's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
20/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 301 4718: Yes,it is .Thanx you sir for being considerate
20/11/23, 8:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: since you have answered all the questions, now a video call would be scheduled with the Program Director, once I submit the evaluation report of Tracy's application.

I have been so happy, as well excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage👏🏽👏🏽. 

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email , and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?

24/11/23, 5:04 am - +263 78 647 4953: Thank you a lot
24/11/23, 12:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 647 4953: I'm doing well and you sir
24/11/23, 1:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to go through the student's acceptance letter and did you manage to discuss it as a family ?
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes
24/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
24/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 647 4953: Yes
24/11/23, 7:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
24/11/23, 7:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
