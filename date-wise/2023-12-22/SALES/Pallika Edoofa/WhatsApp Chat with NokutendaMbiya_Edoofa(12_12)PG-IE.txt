12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 758 0015: I am Nokutenda Mbiya aged 18. I am a hard working person who is very interested in societal issues and is always eager to help in creating a balance in the society and at school l was a peer counsellor, a human rights ambassador and a student represantative in the program by ZIMPAHAC known as PASA. I love writing books and l have been a poet since primary level. I am a great fan of football and a cricket player but l never really participated in any completion. I am a fast learner and a good judge of character but l tend to be overly emotional and a perfectionist and that mostly ruins things for me. I am not a great time keeper and am very slow. I am the first born in a family of two and l live with only my mother

I recently wrote my advanced level at Mzilikazi high 
I did my o level at St Columbus high school
I would like to study law and political science because l feel that way l can help people in a legal manner. I also want to major in political science because l am not much pleased with the governce of my country and l don't like watching things from my sidelines. I want to improve the life of my fellow citizens and show them that you don't always have to rely on those in authority to change one's life. The other reason is that l want to become a good role model for my little sister.
My mother works at Zimbabwe power Company in Bulawayo as a power plant operator. I have a younger sister who is 7years old and is doing her primary level. My mother would be supporting my higher education and  I'm from Matebeleland.
