From a young age, I've always been interested in the complex interplay between the law and society.

21/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 058 1069: I may not have direct experience in the legal field yet, but I've always been fascinated by how the law shapes our society. Even without working in a law office, I've learned a lot about the legal system and its impact on people's lives through my studies and extracurricular activities. I believe that my drive to learn and my passion for justice make me a good fit for a career in law, even though I don't have.Here's how I could add that to the answer...In addition to my academic studies, I've also participated in a mock trial competition in high school. This experience gave me a firsthand look at what it's like to argue a case in court and advocate for a cause. I gained valuable experience in presenting arguments, questioning witnesses, and researching legal issues. This experience further solidified my desire to pursue a career in the legal field.
21/12/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: That is fine, Kimberly

Your comprehensive explanation of your passion for law and your experiences, especially the participation in a high school mock trial competition, is impressive. It's evident that you've actively sought opportunities to engage with the legal system, even without direct professional experience.

21/12/23, 2:29 pm - Kunal: That is alright
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 058 1069: I am very much confident about achieving them
21/12/23, 2:32 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion towards law, you are eligible to pursue

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.
