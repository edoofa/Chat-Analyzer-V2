I am someone who is more concerned in other people's feelings and cares a lot if l have done everything perfectly. Care l can consider it as one of my strengths because l have made some of things l do in life possible due to the care l have for every little thing...l am a lady that enjoys listening to music as a hobby, reading novels too and singing these are the top most hobbies l enjoy. 

My family consists of 3 children  and l am the last born, my mother is now late since 2019 stay with my sisters and my father is someone who is the only one left as a parent.

2. *Psychology* l want to be of help to the people that do not know how to speak up and express their pain.. l want to be the that one person that helps them talk of their issues and heal from them because people out there are suffering a lot but do not know how to speak and don't know how to help themselves from those problems.If one person has a lot of things or issues they are bottling deep down within we can end having people with depression, anxiety and these people are prone to suicidal attempts. So all in all l want to be there to help them through and make sure they have a healthy mindset and emotionally healthy...It is also one of my passion to be a psychologist or therapist ...lt one of my strengths to understand a person by just looking at them.
