21/12/23, 3:40 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 3:41 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: Yess go on
21/12/23, 3:42 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: But before you proceed is quantity surveying also offered there?
21/12/23, 3:52 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: Because my first choice career was quantity surveying then comes civil engineering
21/12/23, 3:55 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that based on your interests in quantity surveying we have offered you this course
21/12/23, 3:56 pm - Kunal: ​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
21/12/23, 3:59 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: Am fine by it
21/12/23, 4:00 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: Let’s proceed then
21/12/23, 4:01 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
21/12/23, 4:05 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: I imagine myself being out there in the fields and working in a lot of companies and getting a salary that will enable me to support my family and as an Edoofian l see myself also encouraging other people to enroll with Edoofa and the good example will be me
21/12/23, 4:06 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time. I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.

So now as you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
21/12/23, 4:09 pm - +265 984 00 71 30: Thank you l look forward to that
