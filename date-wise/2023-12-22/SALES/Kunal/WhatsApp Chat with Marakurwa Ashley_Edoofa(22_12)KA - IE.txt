After interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship, l have learned that  this program helps African students to acquire International Higher Education. It also reduces the stress and the burden of school fees to African parents. It also helps African children who are intelligent to achieve their goals.

Im hoping to be accepted and be one of the Edoofa Students because lm a hard working student who is dedicated to school work and who need to achieve the best inorder to have a brighter future.
