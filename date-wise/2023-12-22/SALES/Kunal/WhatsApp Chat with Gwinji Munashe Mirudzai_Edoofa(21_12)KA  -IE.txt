21/12/23, 1:32 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
21/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 723 0971: Yes i am very confident about achieving it <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 1:43 pm - Kunal: May I know with your interests in Medical field, why didn't you opt for Biology at A level?
21/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 723 0971: From my research i found if you want to study medicine you can go for physics or biology at a level . So physics is my best shot .
21/12/23, 2:13 pm - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
21/12/23, 2:15 pm - Kunal: Since you are not having Biology at A level, you are not qualified for Dentistry. But let me tell you, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, there are courses aligned to Medical Field itself for which you are eligible and can fulfill your dreams to work in this sector, such as 

**Bachelor of Pharmacy*

*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

21/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 723 0971: Bachelor of pharmacy
21/12/23, 2:39 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you, we don't offer medicine as a course because you need to clear the NEET(National Entrance Eligibility Test) which is one the toughest exams globally with great marks to be eligible
21/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 723 0971: Oooh ok Mr Kamal
21/12/23, 2:41 pm - Kunal: So, may I know which course do you wish me to explain?
21/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 723 0971: Bachelor of pharmacy
