20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you
20/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 341 0203: Yes that is correct.
Thank you for the detailed description on the Program
20/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 363 4425: Thank you
20/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Fumani, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Yes I would like to believe I meet these two significant metrics to potentially obtain a higher quantum of Scholarship
20/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I am currently as Proactive as Possible in the counselling session and My Guardian is Currently active online
20/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 363 4425: I am following in the discussion.
20/12/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now Fumani, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?

20/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you for your advice
Law courses are favourable
...
I would kindly request assistance on information concerning employment opportunities...
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
20/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 363 4425: Thank you for the information, we pray for the best.
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I breif you about the course?
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Thank you for this very crucial bit of information 
We appreciate it
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I am confident in my abilities 
The  information is very much appreciated
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 341 0203: Yes please
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law.

20/12/23, 5:00 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:
*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations. The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.
*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.
*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.
*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.
*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

21/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 341 0203: I envision myself as a well-educated and renowned lawyer, which specialises in Company,Family and Cyber related law matters.

I find the idea of working collectively, bringing great minds together, and building a community fascinating.Weather be it in the Cyber,Family or Corporate side of being a lawyer.

I see myself as a good mentor/inspiration to aspiring lawyers, having a tremendous reputation and integrity along with the willpower to stand for the truth at all times. I have the dream of empowering young individuals with knowledge and financial support to achieve their goals.

The Edoofa Program's involvement  in the achieving of my dreams is crucial ,for it is the backbone on which it all rests.
The program would help financially and make the education necessary at least affordable
Alongside helping develop my skills in the law industry through lectures and real-time projects.
The program would also greatly improve my employability by providing me with work experience during the course.From my understanding the Edoofa program would also assist in promoting my growth and professional development. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Fumani I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
21/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I am willing to put 300% and go further beyond
I have big dreams and an even bigger will.
My dedication to this career  is unparalleled. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I feel that abroad there is greater opportunity and exposure
Plus I envy the quality of Education.
I feel the technology is much better/advanced such that it may assist me in learning.
Due to the skill and Experience you are willing to provide me with I feel I would be more marketable in the employment sector.
I also have friends who study abroad and are  excelling hence I admire and aspire to be like them. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
21/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I could be a resourceful individual to people interested in law.
I could share my knowledge in seminars and career guidance days.
I could be available for consultations for those in need of the information/advice.
I would be available for advice pertaining to law and possibly drive and stand for what is morally and lawfully correct.
21/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Fumani, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
21/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 341 0203: I strongly agree.
Everything Big or Small has a starting point.
21/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.
