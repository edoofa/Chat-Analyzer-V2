20/12/23, 7:39 pm - Gurvinder: Dear Mapalo Mweshi

Congratulations! Your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program has been shortlisted, and you have been selected for an early counselling session. EDOOFA is a trusted program for affordable, accessible & employment-driven higher education in India, with over 3000 enrolled students and associations with more than 500 schools across Africa.
20/12/23, 7:39 pm - Gurvinder: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
21/12/23, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 7:19 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
