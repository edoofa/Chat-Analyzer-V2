19/12/23, 10:11 am - +260 767735131: And is also providing more scholarship opportunities for us in Zambia to study abroad
19/12/23, 11:42 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Kulela, and Mrs Changwe,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
19/12/23, 11:43 am - +260 767735131: My pleasure to interact with you too
19/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about the program?
19/12/23, 12:31 pm - +260 767735131: Yes please
19/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 1:14 pm - +260 767735131: Yes it would be a good opportunity for me personally because every good work has a procedure and one has to be determined and forcused
19/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Kulela, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 767735131: Yes I do
19/12/23, 1:38 pm - +260 97 6262181: The pleasure is mine  Mr Gurivinder
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Now Kulela, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
19/12/23, 2:17 pm - +260 767735131: -Am blessings kulela
-Completed my grade twelve this year (2023)
-I would love to study journalism and mass communication
-My mom does business and so does my dad
-their highest education level was senior secondary
-the church was supporting with my senior education with a 100% scholarship
-am not sure with who will be supporting me with my education abroad yet and am hoping you would
-I have three older sisters, the first born is Mwamba kulela who is doing nursing at chreso university in Lusaka, the second one is Mwila Kulela who did agricultural studies in Monze at the Zambia College of Agriculture, and the third one is Chilekwa Kulela who completed her secondary education in 2020 and has not yet started her tertiary education due to financial issues
-I was studying at Njase Girls Secondary School, in southern province, choma district where we paid two thousand, one hundred and fifty five kwacha per term.
19/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: May I know what business do your parents do?
19/12/23, 3:18 pm - +260 767735131: My mom sales clothes and my dad is a carpenter
19/12/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
19/12/23, 3:26 pm - +260 767735131: Thank you
19/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: So has your elder sister Mwila succeeded in getting employment after the degree?
19/12/23, 3:28 pm - +260 767735131: Not yet shes still waiting for employment

19/12/23, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study journalism and mass communication, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
19/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 767735131: Seeing that a lot of people these days go for these courses like nursing and at the end of their study they have struggles in getting jobs, I personally feel journalism is not taken that seriously in Zambia like a lot of people have no interest in studying it and if I was given an opportunity to study journalism abroad I can at least probably learn a lot of different things that here are not taught and when back I share the knowledge and encourage people on what I would learn from there
19/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Your perspective on journalism and mass communication in Zambia is quite true, Kulela. It's true that certain fields, like nursing, often attract many students, sometimes leading to challenges in job opportunities due to high competition. On the other hand, journalism might not be as popular, yet it holds immense potential and significance.
19/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
19/12/23, 4:10 pm - +260 767735131: No one has pursued a career in this field and if I do I'll be the first one and even encourage the others
19/12/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your Garde 10 and Grade 12 results for evaluation?
19/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 767735131: So I'll have to re download my results again which am currently working on can we proceed and I send the results onwards??

20/12/23, 3:17 pm - +260 767735131: Yes please I'll highly appreciate
20/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)* is a 3-year duration undergraduate program for students who wish to pursue their career in Journalism and media industry.
20/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: The Career Options and Job opportunities are very high with the media sector. A student who has completed B.J.M.C can work with the news channels, news magazines, publication houses, Media is a connection between the population and the world. It is an important source by which anybody can get information at the same time and at different places. B.J.M.C course is the source to makeover the skills of students as a journalism or reporter to make aware the public with the current affairs.
20/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: After the successfully completion of this course, students will be able to develop their skills of gathering and transmitting the data and information and deliver it to the audience or population to make them aware what is going around the world.

Such kind of individuals should opt for this course as this course may fulfill their desire and passion as well.

20/12/23, 3:29 pm - +260 767735131: And according to the briefing sent am sure I can manage this course
20/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
20/12/23, 3:58 pm - +260 767735131: Thank you so much, so according to what I had said earlier about journalism not being common in Zambia, I feel in five years time after doing the course, I could easily get a job and since it deals with the media people would easily be communicated to about it and take keen interest in it and also be encouraged to do the same course. Me getting into the Edoofa's program can really help me both financially and academically because I would not have to wait for my parents to first find money to enroll me into tertiary education but instead Edoofa can and that can be an achievement on its own. Secondly, in accordance to the course I've chosen which is journalism and mass communication, the Edoofa program can be the first thing I can want to talk about seeing that I can be dealing with the media and communication and lastly this can really help me achieve my dreams seeing that I have become what I've always wanted to.
20/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Kulela, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
20/12/23, 4:26 pm - +260 767735131: I am very much willing
20/12/23, 4:26 pm - +260 767735131: This I can promise you
20/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
20/12/23, 4:46 pm - +260 767735131: With the course I want to do I feel its not taken that much serious in Zambia like I said earlier and I feel they don't Carter everything
20/12/23, 4:47 pm - +260 767735131: Studying abroad can also advantage me in other areas such as interacting with other people
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
20/12/23, 5:18 pm - +260 767735131: If given an opportunity, I plan to reverage my international education to bring innovative teaching methodologies, cross cultural  perspectives and modern educational practices back to my home country. This would contribute to the enhancement and development of our education system, fostering a more globally competitive and adaptable learning environment
20/12/23, 8:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 8:35 pm - +260 767735131: God bless you too
21/12/23, 9:43 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 9:45 am - +260 767735131: Good morning thank you
21/12/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Kulela, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
21/12/23, 11:47 am - +260 767735131: No I dont
21/12/23, 11:48 am - +260 767735131: One always has to get used to different kinds of environments
21/12/23, 11:49 am - +260 767735131: Because even at my former school Njase, I was once new and I had to get used with the change of environment which I did
21/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, I appreciate your view point.
21/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
21/12/23, 1:05 pm - +260 767735131: Yeah and if you don't mind can you please explain as to why it is like that
21/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

21/12/23, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now Kulela, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
21/12/23, 3:03 pm - +260 767735131: No thank you everything has been understood
21/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
21/12/23, 3:23 pm - +260 767735131: No we are not
21/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Kulela what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/12/23, 3:27 pm - +260 767735131: Alright thank you understood
21/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
21/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 767735131: Yes you can
21/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Kulela, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/12/23, 3:53 pm - +260 767735131: OK sure is there anything else that I need to know under EWYL
21/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
21/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

21/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
21/12/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: @260767735131 Are we still connected? Please be active for 15 minutes so that we can end your counselling session today itself and move on to the next step.
21/12/23, 4:16 pm - +260 767735131: Am there
21/12/23, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
21/12/23, 4:17 pm - +260 767735131: I really think it will benefit me
21/12/23, 4:19 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Kulela, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/12/23, 4:22 pm - +260 767735131: Thats fair I think
21/12/23, 4:22 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/12/23, 4:23 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
21/12/23, 4:27 pm - +260 767735131: I think the EWYL is really a good idea because it pushes one to working hard baring in mind that they are just not learning but also earning something for their education
21/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Kulela, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
21/12/23, 4:29 pm - +260 767735131: Alright thank you
21/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
21/12/23, 4:31 pm - +260 767735131: Not yet but my mom is part of this discussion so maybe hearing from her
21/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
21/12/23, 4:32 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
21/12/23, 4:32 pm - +260 767735131: Yes iam
21/12/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Kulela as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 767735131: A lot of money
21/12/23, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: Please answer with exact figure.
21/12/23, 4:36 pm - +260 767735131: Somewhere $2,250
21/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Kulela, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/12/23, 4:37 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 4:38 pm - +260 767735131: Alright I understand
21/12/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/12/23, 4:39 pm - +260 767735131: I do think so
21/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/12/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
21/12/23, 4:42 pm - +260 767735131: Okay understood
21/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
21/12/23, 4:42 pm - +260 767735131: Not yet familiar
21/12/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Kulela, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
21/12/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/12/23, 4:45 pm - +260 767735131: Yes I have
21/12/23, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/12/23, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
21/12/23, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/12/23, 4:45 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
21/12/23, 4:46 pm - +260 767735131: No I've understood everything thank you
21/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
21/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application.
