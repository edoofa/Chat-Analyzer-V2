18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Caleb, Mrs Chandipwisa!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Good Afternoon to you, thank you for contacting me Caleb Chandipwisa
18/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Caleb,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you Mr Gurvinder
18/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Caleb, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Salma, is that correct?
18/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Yes Mr Gurvinder, she is the one who introduced me.
18/12/23, 3:16 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Salma, also do tell me whether you learnt about Salma’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 349 0117: sorry for the late reply. Sometimes I am facing network challenges
18/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 349 0117: She told me that you offer scholarships to African students and Earn While You Learn programme .
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18/12/23, 5:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 349 0117: That is correct Mr Gurvinder.
18/12/23, 5:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Caleb, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Yes , I believe so.
18/12/23, 6:33 pm - Gurvinder: Now Caleb, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

20/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Crop Science
, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
20/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Since agriculture is the foundation of our economy, I have always had a strong interest for it. The famine experienced by the majority of African nations due to crop failure served as fuel for this. My curiosity about how crops are studied to prevent hunger and poverty is strong.
20/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Your motivation to study Crop Science, particularly in the context of addressing agricultural challenges in African nations, is incredibly important.
20/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
20/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Although I have family members in the broader subject of agriculture, there aren't really any people in my family or circles that have studied crop science specifically.
20/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Diploma results for evaluation?

21/12/23, 8:54 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 349 0117: Good morning Sir, how are you?
21/12/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 322 0135: Good morning, encouraging words. Thank you
21/12/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you for the wise words.
21/12/23, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
21/12/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Caleb, may I know the reason behind doing a Diploma and not pursuing A level?
21/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 71 349 0117: Instead of going to A level where it's just theory, someone can learn additional techniques with a diploma in agriculture. Hence, it was necessary for me to have both theoretical and practical knowledge.
21/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Caleb, due to the fact that you did a diploma, I want to offer you *BSc Biotechnology* over other courses for crop science offers several unique advantages:

Interdisciplinary Approach: Biotechnology encompasses a range of scientific disciplines like biology, chemistry, genetics, and engineering. This interdisciplinary nature allows students to gain a comprehensive understanding of crop science while integrating technological advancements.

Advanced Techniques: Biotechnology equips students with cutting-edge techniques used in crop improvement, such as genetic engineering, tissue culture, and molecular breeding. These methods are crucial in developing more resilient, disease-resistant, and higher-yielding crops.

Impact on Agriculture: Biotechnology plays a pivotal role in addressing global agricultural challenges, including food security, climate change adaptation, and sustainable farming practices. Students in this field have the potential to make substantial contributions to improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Research Opportunities: BSc in Biotechnology offers ample opportunities for research and practical applications. Students can engage in hands-on lab work, experiments, and field trials, gaining valuable experience in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.

Career Prospects: Biotechnology graduates have diverse career options in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. They can work in research institutions, biotech companies, government agencies, or pursue further studies in specialized areas.

Adaptability: Biotechnology skills are transferable across various industries beyond agriculture, providing flexibility in career choices and professional growth.
21/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 349 0117: Thank you for the offer, Sir. It will be a fantastic chance that will help me advance my career significantly.
21/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
21/12/23, 7:30 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time.
