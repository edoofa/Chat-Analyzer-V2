In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

This is becau I'm a person who like to interact with many people either helping them with ideas or counseling them. For example social work and journalism , you work publicly asking people their problems and giving them help in form of kind or ideas .  in law you work  fighting for  justice mostly for the vulnerable people who mostly accused for being guilty by privileged ones  therefore as a lawyer you work protecting them form being arrested. Hence , what motivates me behind these fields is our corrupt country where the privileges  insult the less privileges ones.
20/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 502 7703: And above all, l like the good lifestyles of the people who work in these fields .

20/12/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in these fields?
20/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 502 7703: As far as I know my family or known circle no one is in such these field it's me who want to be the  first one to so that my young brothers and sisters can follow up the good route
