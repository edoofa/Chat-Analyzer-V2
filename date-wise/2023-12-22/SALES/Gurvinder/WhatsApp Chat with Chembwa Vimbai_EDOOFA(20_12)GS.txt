You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
20/12/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Yes indeed Sir you have contacted the right person and I will be sure to be available online tomorrow by 9:00. Thank you for considering my application.
21/12/23, 8:57 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 153 0000: Good morning Sir
21/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Vimbai,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
21/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 153 0000: Okay , Mr Gurvinder
21/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Vimbai, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tinotenda, is that correct?
21/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 153 0000: Yes it is
21/12/23, 7:43 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
21/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 153 0000: My apologies about that. I will be online tomorrow 9:00 sharp.
