20/12/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, 

You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 9:53 am - +260 774124400: Thank you
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.
20/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..


Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

21/12/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 9:17 am - +260 774124400: Alright thank you
21/12/23, 9:18 am - +260 774124400: What are the requirements for one to obtain a 100% scholarship?
21/12/23, 9:35 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship, Kaluba?
21/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 774124400: This is a fully funded scholarship
21/12/23, 9:38 am - +260 774124400: Apologies, let me rephrase my question
21/12/23, 9:39 am - +260 774124400: How are scholarships allocated?
21/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
21/12/23, 10:18 am - +260 774124400: Thank you for the clarification
21/12/23, 10:23 am - +260 774124400: When a person is accepted to study in India, who covers the cost for accommodation, food, and transport? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 10:25 am - +260 774124400: Does the ewyl program cover these needs?
21/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Before I address the same, Kaluba. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Did you understand that Edoofa offers scholarships?
21/12/23, 11:06 am - +260 774124400: Yes
21/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: So are you clear that Edoofa helps with 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee, Kaluba?
21/12/23, 11:27 am - +260 774124400: Yes
21/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.

21/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Kindly note and understand that we have just begun with your counseling session and would be following a proper process where I shall brief you about everything.
21/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
