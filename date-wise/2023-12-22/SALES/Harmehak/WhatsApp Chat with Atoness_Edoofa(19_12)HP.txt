20/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Well Atoness now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/12/23, 12:27 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I do believe so .
Growing up I had always wanted to study abroad, and if I can have an opportunity to do so ,

It's a pleasure to know about them all.
20/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: So Atoness, may I have a better understanding to who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in?
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - +27 64 981 6126: My father will be supporting me financially and he works under the metallic industry
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted Atoness.
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/12/23, 3:12 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Unfortunately,
I'm a student in South Africa and I was doing matric.

So  what levels do you consider for one to get a scholarship .
20/12/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

Similarly for Grade 12, you must have passes in 4 major subjects, Atoness.
20/12/23, 3:58 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay , I understand, I'm confident about that
20/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
20/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, may I please have the list of subjects you appeared for in this term?
20/12/23, 4:50 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Mathematics
Physical sciences
Geography
Life Sciences
English Home Language

20/12/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: Received, Atoness,

20/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Medicine , Atoness?
20/12/23, 6:12 pm - +27 64 981 6126: It's a dream , looking deep into the medical industry is makes one to find out more things about human health, I wanna discover the causes of certain disease and have more understanding about the human body .
Saving people's lives is one of the main thingd
20/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and equally appreciate your desire to help other, Atoness.
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I'm glad to hear that 😊
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: So Atoness, what all did you research regarding medicine?

Along with the same what did you research regarding medicine in India and its requirements?
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I know that medicine requires one to have high marks especially in science subjects, a lot of students tend to drop medicine because it is a bit challenging.
20/12/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: I can understand what you are sharing and that is quite true as well!

And what did you research regarding the requirements to pursue medicine in India?
20/12/23, 6:53 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Academic qualifications: To secure MBBS admission in India, candidates must have passed class 12 from a recognised board. Subjects studied: To pursue an MBBS course, students should have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in their class 11 and 12.
One must be 18-25 yrs
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
20/12/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

21/12/23, 11:28 am - +27 64 981 6126: Ohhh this is amazing indeed.
Seems like graduating from universities in India van increase chances of finding job world's
21/12/23, 11:28 am - +27 64 981 6126: Worldwide*
21/12/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/12/23, 11:30 am - +27 64 981 6126: Nope, 
They are not aware
21/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Alright please
21/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/12/23, 11:32 am - +27 64 981 6126: Ohhh I understand, that's why I'm trying to get the scholarship
21/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 11:36 am - +27 64 981 6126: Okay , I see that the Edoofa Scholarship makes it easier for parents.
21/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
21/12/23, 11:57 am - +27 64 981 6126: I think that's a great thing indeed
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

21/12/23, 12:08 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay I understand the EWYL Program
21/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

I now realise that
21/12/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
21/12/23, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: @27649816126 ?
21/12/23, 6:35 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I'm ready now
21/12/23, 6:57 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/12/23, 7:04 pm - +27 64 981 6126: 1
21/12/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: I didn't get you!

Are you thoroughly following, Atoness?
21/12/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
