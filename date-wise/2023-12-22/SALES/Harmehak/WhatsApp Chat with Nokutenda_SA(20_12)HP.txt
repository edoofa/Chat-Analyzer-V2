20/12/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Hello Ms Harmehak

I am using my mother's phone right now 
Mine is off @263713320964

Anyways l am a young man
English and Shona are languages um comfortable using
I do not have a criminal record
I love learning about  new things...it keep me going ,knowing that they is more to the world than most people see it,and learning how things work
And for this reason that's why l would love to do engineering...it's a field filled will amaizing tech..etc.
Unlike most fields it's not limited
It goes beyond and even beyond our world and deeper into outer space

As for my Education
Right now l just finished writing A level and waiting for my results

But l won't lie 
My A level journey was not an easy one...
I was always behind..I had to work twice as much to keep up with others...
The combination l was doing was Maths 
Physics and Chem

And Maths was my best subject followed with Physics and lastly Chem..
I did find chemistry to be difficult for me because even if l read it, still l would fail to grasp the concepts and when l did grasp them the questions came in another format....
My weakness is l find it hard interacting with people very much...
It's as if l am an extrovert 


I do wish to study Engineering... l love it and they is no better way of making money than with what you love doing..

As for my hobbies l enjoy internet surfing and dancing


I don't come from a wealthy family...we do what we have to,to get by..
We are a family of 5 my me, mother, father and two siblings both girls

My mother is a stay at home mom
And my father works as a lab technician at a local company..

As for my siblings they are both still at school
One in high school the other in primary school
21/12/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
21/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Saturday at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
21/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 888 1216: We can go ahead we have network prob and electricity problem, so bear with us dear
21/12/23, 10:55 pm - +263 71 332 0964: Hello Mrs Harmehak
@919871782922 

I know my participation is most important for me to be able to get the scholarship especially with the tight competition

Unfortunately due to network issues,l sometimes fail to be online 
Which l know will impact my chances of getting it

Also they is an issue with time especially the early hours of the day..
I happened to be chosen by a company recently due to my performance as far as their work is required and they hired me
So during the day l will be working and around 21:00 C.A.T l knock off
They said after the festive season the times will be better and instead of 21:00 will knock off at 15:00 C.A.T
The reason l am working right now is so l can find money to help me with any educational stuff which might be needed as l go on
So l won't be left out .

I am really sorry but earlier hours of the day are very challenging for me..
If possible
I ask you help me by rescheduling to late hours of the day..
If you're not comfortable it's alright
I will see what l can do
Because l really need this
