21/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 166 1430: I am going U6 next year and am doing mathematics, Food Technology and Design. Am looking forward to be a nutritionist, food specialists or anything in the line of food science because I like designing recipes and as for me food is just fascinating I feel alive when am doing food science stuff also I have always wondered how food is prepared in industries. both my parents are in the line of education as teachers with my Dad having a diploma in education while my mother has a degree in education. I have got 3 siblings with me being the only boy. My big sister is in the music industry and the next one is finishing year 2 in tertiary this year then comes the little girl who is going grade 7 as of next year. both my parents have been supporting me financially in education and they are going to continue to doing so when am in higher education abroad. My school fees per term is $120 at the school Hippo High School in Masvingo province. About myself well I believe I have got good communication skills, and punctuality is a personality of mine also creative with stuff and also good at solving problems. Well what is a human if he/she can't acknowledge his weaknesses mine being someone who is a bit slow in what I do also I get emotionally attached to things and also have trouble in saying no to people. I play chess in my extra time and sometimes read novels or research on recipes and designing some of them. Well I grew up in a family with 3 girls and we also lived with 2 of my uncles who didn't have their parents. Well I can not say something was lacking growing up because my parents always supported me in everything I do and also growing up things were a bit easy thoughsometimes school was challenging.

21/12/23, 10:48 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have a younger sibling in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
21/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 166 1430: Well yeah they are but it seems they are pulling through because she hasn't been send home from school because of school fees

21/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: The Board has found you eligible for BSc Nutrition and Dietetics
21/12/23, 12:25 pm - Tushti: Shall I brief you about the course?
21/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Yes please
21/12/23, 12:30 pm - Tushti: *B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics* is a 3- year long full- time undergraduate course divided over 6 semesters. It involves the study of food management, promotion of health through healthy food, and primarily focusses on the relationship between the body and food.
B.Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics essentially involves an advanced learning in ways to enhance the quality of life and overall well-being by promoting healthy diet behaviors and exploring healthier dietary modifications.

The program consists of a comprehensive curriculum that combines the science of nutrition with a broader view of wellness, community and environment, delving into reasons for unhealthy eating behaviors and ways to rectify and improve the same.

Students interested in learning about nutritional matters and food habits, and in training in health care units such as clinics, hospitals and community nutrition in close proximity of doctors, clinicians and dieticians, are best suited for a B.Sc. in Nutrition & Dietetics.

Ideal candidates would have relevant skills such as tact, team spirit and compassion, and an inherent instinct to counsel, guide, and treat patients suffering from diet- based health issues.

Nutrition and Dietetics is fast- growing both as an academic discipline and in practical application, both in India and abroad. Successful graduates of the course interested in further studies in the discipline may pursue M.Sc., M.Phil. and Ph. D in the same subject. Those interested in professionally working in the industry and find lucrative employment opportunities in private sector clinics and hospitals, or may get self-employed.

Other areas of employment include private sector organizations such as leisure cruise companies and private nursing homes. Such graduates may also choose to become psychiatric nursing as a profession where they work with patients suffering from emotional and psychological distress caused from unhealthy diet patterns.
21/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Okay I get it Thank you
21/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Well with what you said about the program I feel this is what I wanted
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
21/12/23, 12:35 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
21/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 166 1430: well after 5 years I believe that I will have a job that will make me be able to help my parents with their finances especially sending my little sibling to a good school. I think in 5 years I will be able to start own a little restaurant which I will upgrade as time goes by. I also see my future as someone recognized in the books of food scientists and also I will be going to school to get a masters of the program like to study more and to get more knowledge. I believe with this scholarship you are to give me it will make things a bit easy for me to find jobs as I will be connected with people like you who are well recognized all over the world. Also I believe that my parents' work will be easier since I will be enrolled into a scholarship
21/12/23, 1:28 pm - Tushti: That is really great Luckson, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
21/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 166 1430: I am willing to do so it has been something i have always wanted and as we all know when one wants simething he/she gives it his or her full potential
21/12/23, 1:33 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Well because I believe that abroad I will get many job opportunities
21/12/23, 1:35 pm - Tushti: I see

21/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Now i understand why you recommend it and I think it is also a good choice
21/12/23, 2:54 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
21/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 239 9005: Yes madam, the eldest daughter completed Production Engineering
21/12/23, 3:33 pm - Tushti: May I know which university she was enrolled in, and what was the term fee there?
21/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 239 9005: Chinhoyi university of Zimbabwe,$450 fees,a monthly accommodation  of $120 and food staffs $80 monthly
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: I see
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/12/23, 3:38 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 3:39 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 3:39 pm - Tushti: In simple words Lucksonwhat we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/12/23, 4:04 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 166 1430: No they are not
21/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 166 1430: Am sorry ma'am something came up at the last moment that needed my attention and I couldn't meet your time I apologise for that
21/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 166 1430: I also see it good for me to study in India because the costs per year are affordable also it makes things easy for me to find a job since you will have plans for me already
21/12/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 166 1430: the learn while you learn program is also good since it also gives me experience in my line of work also helping my parents with the tuition fees
