I can say I was born a leader, am able to lead  and organise events. I am the chairperson of the girls league at my church. When I was in grade four I was elected as a prefect and became the headgirl in grade seven at Chishamiso primary . I was also the netball team captain. When I was in form three I was once again selected as a prefect at Hippo High school. Now in lower six I was again selected as senior prefect and I am the current captain of Hippo Valley High school netball team.
 However as a human being I also have some weaknesses such as rushing into conclusions, 

Educationally I passed my O level with flying colours of 3As and 7Bs

My favorite hobby is cooking. I love cooking. Others use music to distress themselves but I use cooking as a distressor. The kitchen is my home. Another hobby of mine is watching television; cooking programs in particular such as Master Chef . I also like playing netball, basketball and hockey.

1. Currently am doing L5 studying Statistics, Business Enterprise and skills and also Food Technology and Design
2. Would like to study Tourism and Hospitality  since I have a passion in cooking or Business Management since I feel was born leader
3. My mother is a teacher by profession
4. Her Highest is Diploma in Education and currently studying ICT
5. Yes, she is in form three
6.My mother is supporting my educational finances
7.  My mother
