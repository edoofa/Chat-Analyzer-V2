*8. English Medium of Instruction:* English is widely used as a medium of instruction in Indian universities, ensuring a comfortable learning experience for international students.

*9. Research and Innovation Opportunities: Indian institutions offer opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research and innovation. They can collaborate with experts, contribute to advancements in their fields, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

19/09/23, 2:49 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Affordable education and advanced to technology
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Wow..This is great
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: May I know if you understood everything properly?
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Still going through
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: No
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Please share the expense
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
19/09/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

19/09/23, 2:54 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Following
19/09/23, 2:55 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: This is great
19/09/23, 2:58 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Do these apply for all programs
?
Or they differ per program
19/09/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Cost is different for different programs.
19/09/23, 3:19 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Alright fine
19/09/23, 3:19 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: How much is it for MBA?
19/09/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
19/09/23, 3:28 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Yes.Do so
19/09/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/09/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: 1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
19/09/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
19/09/23, 3:35 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: I think it's a great initiative not only for exposure but also it's a learning technique
19/09/23, 3:36 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: It will definitely be beneficial
19/09/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/09/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/09/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
19/09/23, 3:40 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Wow that's a great incentive
19/09/23, 3:40 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: But what sort of work do they do
19/09/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/09/23, 3:42 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: I get this
19/09/23, 3:51 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/09/23, 3:52 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Yes
19/09/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Witness, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/09/23, 3:54 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: $1500-$2250
19/09/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/09/23, 3:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 3:55 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: But $750 is greater than application cost for one university
19/09/23, 3:56 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Alright I get this
19/09/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: Witness, the enrollment fee is only $350
19/09/23, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: And it is for multiple universities.
19/09/23, 3:57 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: I understand
19/09/23, 3:57 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Wow that's great
19/09/23, 3:57 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
19/09/23, 3:58 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: I do
19/09/23, 3:58 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: It's great that you assist the students in every step
19/09/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/09/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you
above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/09/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/09/23, 4:16 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Following
19/09/23, 4:18 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: This is very understanding of you
19/09/23, 4:21 pm - Gurvinder: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
19/09/23, 4:36 pm - +265 999 93 66 80: Yes
19/09/23, 8:26 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:26 pm - Gurvinder: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared
19/09/23, 8:26 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Malawi itself. <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 8:27 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/09/23, 8:27 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025).
19/09/23, 8:27 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
19/09/23, 8:27 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 8:31 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
19/09/23, 8:31 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/09/23, 8:31 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

05/10/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @265884615911 Please don't get me wrong but this is not the first time I am counseling any student. I personally have been helping students for the last 4 and a half years, and when I say that, with a little bit of my own experience, I personally feel there is actually something else which is the real concern over here!

Why don't you honestly share the real query with me, because there is surely something else which is a matter of concern right now? 

Don't be hesitant to share what is going on, because if you would not communicate, I am not a God who would understand what is going on in your mind without you even sharing it with me.

I hope you are doing well

I have been trying to connect with you over the past 2-3 days. And I can see that you are going through my message but are not replying. May I Know what is happening?
09/10/23, 7:58 am - +265 999 93 66 80: Good morning
09/10/23, 8:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Witness

How are you?

How was your weekend?
09/10/23, 8:49 am - +265 884 61 59 11: Am at work.

I might be on or offline due to work.
09/10/23, 8:51 am - Shubham Madhwal: I understand Mr Chipeta, But it's been around 11 days, and we haven't received the initial amount yet, We are waiting for you to share the swift receipt, Which generally takes only 2-3 days after you are provided the slip you shared with me earlier.
09/10/23, 8:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am not sure what issue you are facing or if do you not want to proceed with the process, because now the academic board is asking me to get a concrete update on the scholarship seat reserved for Witness. We have been reserving the seat of our confidence since you shared the slip with us on the 29th of October, And we took your word for it and have been expecting you to provide us with the updates
09/10/23, 9:21 am - +265 884 61 59 11: It's unfortunate that the bank is delaying the process of paying for the enrollment fee for Witness.
09/10/23, 9:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: So Mr Chipeta, even the number you shared with us is not responding to me. I am here to assist you with your issues and concerns, And I am trying my best to guide you, But I think you should take this situation more seriously because unless we get a confirmation from the bank till then we will not be able to confirm you the status of Witness's scholarship
09/10/23, 9:31 am - +265 884 61 59 11: I was just talking to the bank official about the delay.

She says it is because of the problem of forex.

Our country is facing a big problem on forex 

She is the SWIFT receipt shall only be issued once payment has been processed at the bank.

She has assured that today she will still work out on it
09/10/23, 9:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted
09/10/23, 9:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Please keep me updated with the progress
09/10/23, 9:34 am - +265 884 61 59 11: Cash is there with my account.Its surprising that it has happening like that.

I don't know how you can assist me because I have also tried my best to be helped
09/10/23, 9:39 am - +265 884 61 59 11: Yes

There is no way I can be lying to you or failing to give you full explanation.

Am very much eager to help my daughter.
I know it's her future.

But because the office handling my issue is a different entity.
