16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - +260 97 4813102: This is beautiful, given a chance , hard work should be my goal.
16/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now update you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - +260 97 4813102: Yes, we are here
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/12/23, 1:40 pm - +260 97 4813102: Very well understood sir
16/12/23, 4:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good day everyone Please excuse me for being unavailable. I was facing technical issues today because of which I was unable to conduct your session today. I hope you will understand.

We will now connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

18/12/23, 1:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.

18/12/23, 1:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
18/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 97 4813102: My views  are that, the program is very much beneficial because it is an empowerment by nature. 
The fact that, the edoofians students after their graduation have a high chances of getting employment, it shows how beneficial the program is to me. 
The insights Edoofians students get from learning through the experience of others puts one on an advantage point. The fact that, the EWYL conducts webinars on a regular basis with experienced current leaders in the business field , students stands a better chance to face any challenges in their respect professionals in the world. I like the point that, Edoofians students after completing their education are able to turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on top in any field. 
To me this will benefit me more as it goes together with my wish to stand on my own. To reach this level where , I can stand on my own, I need Recruitment partner  which through EWYL has created a holistic environment which together with some brands and companies and Edoofa are recruiting young Edoofians after completing their education. To me, this will be my starting point and it will benefit me more.

18/12/23, 2:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
18/12/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 4813102: Exactly sir.
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 3:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please  share your understanding of this picture with me?
18/12/23, 3:55 pm - +260 97 4813102: My understanding of the picture is that, it about the complete process into being an Edoofian (student). From the very time one starts counselling into being an Edoofian up to the time he or she starts learning in India.
01. This is the introduction which is about knowing the applicant . It is all about my personality' as a candidate. 
02.This is interview to determine the eligibility of the applicant. These includes the education level of the applicant. 
03. Acceptance into edoofa program. At this point, it means one as qualified but not yet enrolled.
04.Enrollment into edoofa program. It is process of doing all registration work. 
05.Admission process after enrollment into edoofa program.  This is where one is allowed to study in the university officially . Sometimes in some universities the candidate pays the admission fee that is when he or she is acknowledged  in the university.
06.Admission letter and Visa. It is a letter which shows that, one is admitted in the university, and visa is the permission to enter and study in the foreign country.
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
18/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
18/12/23, 4:03 pm - +260 97 4813102: Yes Sir, I don't know if you are in the position of telling me, how long it will take me to do my course ( Commerce)?
18/12/23, 4:05 pm - +260 97 4813102: However, am grateful I have learnt a lot from this counseling sessions. Thank you for your guidance.
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please 3 years Amanda
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
18/12/23, 4:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
18/12/23, 4:54 pm - +260 97 4813102: Thanks
18/12/23, 5:00 pm - +260 97 4813102: Honestly speaking , everything about edoofa is very much interesting to me hence making it difficult to pick. But I pick number 2
18/12/23, 5:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
18/12/23, 5:43 pm - +260 97 4813102: Yes you have in number 2 on the facts where edoofa stands  compared to other scholarships programs.
18/12/23, 5:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
18/12/23, 6:03 pm - +260 97 4813102: I understand and thanks
18/12/23, 6:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
18/12/23, 6:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 6:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
18/12/23, 6:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected?
18/12/23, 7:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 7:15 pm - +260 97 4813102: Noted sir
19/12/23, 8:34 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Mr John and Ms Emeldah @260974813102 @260976515541, How are you?
19/12/23, 8:44 am - +260 97 4813102: Good morning sir, we are okay and ready for today's session.
19/12/23, 8:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great pleases
19/12/23, 8:56 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
19/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 4813102: Yes
19/12/23, 9:27 am - Shubham Madhwal: So shall we  continue with our session aahead?
19/12/23, 9:34 am - +260 97 4813102: Yes sir
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 9:55 am - +260 97 4813102: Okay, we are following.
19/12/23, 9:55 am - +260 97 4813102: This is okay with us
19/12/23, 10:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
19/12/23, 10:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
19/12/23, 10:03 am - +260 97 4813102: Okay, this is good to hear. We are following you sir.
19/12/23, 10:06 am - +260 97 4813102: Can we ask a question here sir?
19/12/23, 10:17 am - +260 97 4813102: Okay, it is clear on the question we wanted to ask.
19/12/23, 10:30 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, Share your question!

SECTION 2 READING TEST

This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s.

Introduction. The life in Rwanda 16 years after a genocide. In the first place, it is very much important to note that, genocide in Rwanda happened in 1994. The genocide is a civil war which took almost hundred days between the Tutsi, Hatu and Twa tribes. The Twa , are the smallest tribe of people, followed by the Tutsi and Hutu are the majority. During the genocide, the heavily armed Hutu militia killed many people from the three tribes with the majority being Tutsi. The women were raped and abused in all manner one can think of. I must mention that, long before the genocide, the three tribes lived in harmony and practiced intermarriage without any problem. However, after the genocide, even after 16 years, life in Rwanda has never been the same.
Poverty and Living Conditions. Poverty and seasonal variations in the prices of many food and crops, did limit the capacity of many people in Rwanda. Accessing food and many basic commodities was never easy as many if not the majority of people lived below $1 in a day. Rebuilding a nation which has experienced war even if it is internal, is not easy. Many people could have lost a lot during genocide to the point that, even after 16 years some people did not recover from this event. The impact of the genocide was so huge as many men were killed leaving women leading their families. In some  cases, some families lost both parents, their father and mother in the genocide leaving the eldest child leading the family. This still is the most painful things about the genocide in Rwanda. 
The Effects Of Genocide. The effects of genocide in Rwanda, were in both short and long terms to the survivors. Since we are talking about life in Rwanda after 16 years when genocide happened, the effects I wish to mention here, are long ones. Firstly, the trauma the survivors went through during the genocide had affected them in many ways even after 16 years. In my mind, I have the women who were raped occasionally by different armed soldiers, it is obvious that, life was not making sense to them. Some found it hard to move on or forgot their bad experiences. The Children who lost their both parents, could have been going through a lot. There can never be a bad experience, than seeing your own mother being raped and killed or seeing your father being abused, tortured until he dies. It is obvious that, many children who had these experiences were affected negatively. To some extent, most of these women and children continued to live in fear. 
The other effect could be depression which obviously affected the survivors psychologically. This situation could have made them to live not only in fear but it could have made it difficult for them to trust each other. The Tutsi could no longer trust the Hutu. The intermarriages which were high before the genocide had reduced. Social interaction and integration of tribes was very much a big challenge. Though tribalism and hurt speech contributed massively to the genocide, even after 16 years, tribalism and hurt speech continued. Those who lost their relatives in genocide found hard to forgive those they perceived to have killed or contributed to the demise of their loved ones. 
Politically. It should mentioned here that, after 16 year since the genocide happened in Rwanda, politically the nation was moving to the right direction. Though, in terms of democracy, many opposition parties continued complaining concerning the obstacles they facing in the political cycle. On the other hand, the government in power embarked on robust development program which was appreciated even by the international agencies. Many survivors received this development program with thanksgiving in their hearts. Inspired by the President, many people started working hard to rebuild their loved nation. This development has really changed Rwanda cities greatly. 
Economically. Like I have already pointed at the fact that, many people in Rwanda at that time were living below $1. However, it must be noted that, this is the case in many African nations. Many thanks goes to the government, which put in place some good policies

MY INSPIRATION STORY 
Being a first born child in the family, I take it already  an inspiration. My parents has always emphasized and encouraged me to set the standard, that is high standard to my siblings. Since  my father is a  Pastor, everyone expect nothing from me but the best. Both mum and dad are Christians. My parents have inspired me to live a good life style worthy of a child of God. As a result, I look at  my parent's dedicated life style, which has  always taught me to be content with what I have. This teaching has helped me even when I was in boarding school. My inspirational parents taught me to budget and use my food and other items with caution. Dad and mum's steady spending has inspired me greatly. I have learnt that contentment is a virtue that should be treasured. 
I have also developed an ability of  hardworking which is my parents way of life. My upbringing has  always been celebrated by my fellow students in secondary school. Many student's were inspired by the way I managed my affairs as a pupil. This inspirational abilities motivated many pupils to learn from how to manage myself . 
My friends who have benefited from my culture have been inspired by my spending. Others have asked their parents to allow them to spend a holiday with us so that they can come and appreciate Dad and mum's home management. Others are encouraged by my outdo  performance that has inspired a lot of my peers. Because I have inspired many, this has pushed me to work even harder than before. I have always checked myself in check so that. I don't lose truck but maintain the trajectory of success. My mother and my father, they encouraged me to be try and stand alone through hard work, as hard work pays. This has encouraged me to work extra hard. My dear parents, not forgetting my Secondary teachers have proved to be my source of inspiration. 
At church, as Sunday child, am a source of inspiration to my young people as I sing well and always want to do my best. This has become my way of life, always wanting to inspire someone in what I do. This is who I am .
