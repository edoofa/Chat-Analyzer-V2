In case you do not follow these terms then the entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*. <This message was edited>

2) If the girls are found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *26th December 2023*

19/12/23, 1:51 pm - Tushti: Please you can connect with one of our top performers here in India, Natasha Banda, She is Mr Shubham's student who arrived in India in the month of August-September 2023. To pursue her Education in the field of Mechanical Engineering. She is pursuing her education at one of the best private universities in India, Lovely Professional University.

She is also an alumnus of your school - NJASE Girls Secondary School, Zambia. So I am sure after connecting with her you will be able to understand the benefits of higher education through the Edoofa Program
19/12/23, 3:52 pm - Tushti: Do let me know once you have had a chance to speak with our student
19/12/23, 4:00 pm - +260 97 2000140: Ok, i will do so tomorrow at 09hrs
19/12/23, 4:01 pm - Tushti: Noted!
20/12/23, 12:01 pm - Tushti: Hello , Good afternoon, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/12/23, 12:03 pm - +260 97 2000140: Yes indeed. Am fine thank you and goodafternoon to you too.
20/12/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: *Rules for the Interview Round:*

Go through the rules carefully and please be active. During the interview I want you to be constantly active/online on WhatsApp for the entire interview session. Secondly, the interview will take place on WhatsApp, *via voice notes/voice messages*. Therefore make sure you maintain a decent internet connection for an efficient interview.
*Note, I will be adding you to a new group for your interview. Please greet the dignitaries and Introduce yourself via voice note for your interview to begin*
20/12/23, 12:22 pm - +260 97 2000140: Here is my second thought; Let us stay the application process for now until we receive the national Grade 12 results.

Iam convinced that the national results will be a better determining factor for which courses the girls should pursue.

Hence, i feel the process should be put on hold until then.


I do understand the fact that this delay shall have an added cost to this initiative in the near future than now, but it is prudent to act only when all necessary information becomes available and we shall determine how it works and fits out in the above initiative.

I submit
20/12/23, 12:23 pm - Tushti: The grade 12 results would not have any bearing on the student's course choices, as they are already eligible for the courses they have opted for
20/12/23, 12:25 pm - +260 97 2000140: Misozi, i ask for your input

20/12/23, 12:39 pm - +260 97 4809361: Yes
20/12/23, 12:40 pm - +260 97 4809361: No Iam explaining to him right now he missed a few things about the program.
20/12/23, 12:42 pm - +260 97 4809361: As Natasha explained, once accepted and the fees are paid,the girls will become part of edoofa after which edoofa will find universities for them using their results
20/12/23, 12:44 pm - +260 97 4809361: And if no  university accepts their results,the fee gets refunded.
