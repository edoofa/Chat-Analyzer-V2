Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
21/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 300 2882: From my research medical studies abroad primarily offer a chance to widen one’s perspective, and be familiar with the international medical field. All of which can give me an edge in the arena considering that practicing medicine is a global career. And it would also offer an opportunity to see more of the world generally. 


As I have always looked up to my relatives from abroad pulling more of the weight of the whole family's difficult struggles all pushing me to become a better self to be able to pull my own weight and help the coming generations of my family to live a better life.
This would be the main motivation to working hard
21/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 300 2882: Year of completion of A level is 2023
21/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 300 2882: I will arrange for the scanned pictures as soon as I can

They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I will be waiting for your response, Victor.
