21/12/23, 9:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The classroom is a canvas, and each lesson is a stroke that contributes to the masterpiece of a well-rounded mind." - Unknown*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
21/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 782 0024: Good morning

Am ready
21/12/23, 9:22 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Belinda!
21/12/23, 9:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Belinda, could you please share why you didn't pursue Chemistry in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial subject for Civil Engineering, isn't it?
21/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 782 0024: Indeed the day is beautiful
21/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 782 0024: That is very correct,my teachers somehow had their personal wars over which subjects I should have pursued. It was from this that I saw myself being coerced into doing Geography instead of Chemistry. As if that was not enough, I thot I could do four subjects but to me,the Chemistry teacher appeared non committed, to the point that I saw it unwise to pursue it
21/12/23, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study *Mechanical Engineering* / *Civil Engineering* then they should have *Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics* in their A level mandatorily.
21/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 782 0024: So all my efforts, zeal and desire to become an engineer gets shattered then!
21/12/23, 9:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Belinda. Since the Engineering Sector is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Engineering Sector to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
21/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 782 0024: Yes sir
21/12/23, 10:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that you could pursue which would also align with the Engineering Sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science*

3. *Bachelor of Technology in Electrical and Electronics Engineering*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
