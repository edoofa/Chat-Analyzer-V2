12/12/23, 9:39 am - Harmehak: I am glad please.
12/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

12/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words please, Mrs Grace.
12/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Valery, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
12/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 528 0118: My name is Valery Ruvimbo Juru, a student at Daramombe High School who just finished her lower six there. I also completed my ordinary level studies at Daramombe as well. I completed my primary level here in Chitungwiza at Zengeza 5 Primary.Well growing up I have always been so interested in computers from the start and i have grown to be more passionate about it. Given that I am doing computer science,  businesss studies and mathematics now I would really want to study computer science given that I am so driven with the subject and I am positive I will do exceptionally well. Academically I can say I'm a slightly above average student and with hard work can produce pleasing results. I am a creative person and a good teamworker as well. I am good at adapting to changing situations. I can also say I struggle with delegating tasks. 

I am an athlete as well as a chess player who was proud to represent her school in the nationals this year. I enjoy reading novels during my free time.

My father has a diploma in physiotherapy and works as a Physiotherapist at Chitungwiza hospital .My mother has a diploma in teaching and works at Zengeza 5 Primary. We are 4 in our family 1 boy and 3 girls. My brother is an ICT auditor, my sister is a laboratory scientist and my other sister is a Safety Health Environmental Officer
12/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Valery, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to see that you are hardworking and a dedicated student who is equally invested in sports.

I can see your parents have lead a family that greatly values education and your siblings pursuing proper careers is a great example.
12/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Are you following please Mrs Grace?
12/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes yes Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So far do you have any queries please?
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes l would  like to know the types of schoolerships that you offer
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Like, are they fully or part funded .are students  allowed  to work whiles  studying
12/12/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
12/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Thank you for enlightening  me on that one ,the last past when you   said someone has to work for the organization  after completing  a course is quite good .that's  how we used to get our tertiary education here.we would be given grants for the 3 or 4 years then after completing  the course  when u start working  a certain  percentage  was deducted  from your salary  to fund others  and education was for all the rich and the poor
12/12/23, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: That's not the case please,

They earn and work during their course itself please,

I would discuss the details of Earn While You Learn Program with you.
12/12/23, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Kkkkk thank u for setting  the record straight  l think  she can earn more than 6 points
12/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: That's great
12/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 286 6794: We are very confident  she is going to score higher
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, Mrs Grace.

She shared she wishes to pursue Computer science, 

Are you aware of the same please?
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes but we don't  know other programs  that she can do with her combination  Maths ,computers science  and BS
12/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Considering her subjects combination, she can pursue the following:

*Bachelor of science in computer science*
*Bachelor in Computer Applications*
*Bachelor in business administration*
*Bachelor of science - honors in Accounting*
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 528 0118: can we get more details on bachelor of science in computer science
12/12/23, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Sure please

13/12/23, 9:09 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
13/12/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 286 6794: Yes
13/12/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: That is really great Valery, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!
13/12/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Mrs Grace?
13/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 286 6794: Yes I have
13/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful
13/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Mrs Grace, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
13/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 286 6794: Yes you can explain why you recommend Indiaas a higher education  platform
13/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

13/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 286 6794: Thank you now l understand  why Edoofa  recommends India as a higher  education  platform
13/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
13/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 286 6794: No but would  like to know
13/12/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Sure please
13/12/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
13/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
13/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 9:55 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 286 6794: Thank u yes Edoofa scholarships are quite affordable hope my daughter  will qualify
13/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same.
13/12/23, 10:04 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
13/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 286 6794: Wonderful  ,so let us start serving  for that now
13/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 286 6794: When do they usually  start their  semesters
13/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Next year August when they complete their A level please.
13/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
13/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
13/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

13/12/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 286 6794: Thank you thank you am learning  a lot
13/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: I am glad please.
13/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
13/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 286 6794: That's great  if l may ask who pays for the air ticket  if us how much
13/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: The air tickets usually range between $300-$450.
13/12/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.

So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2025, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2025. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2025, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa. But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August 2025 as per your preparations.
13/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 286 6794: OK, which
13/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

13/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 286 6794: Waaa that's  great  it also teaches  students to be responsible  and not to rely  on their parents
13/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Very correct please,

They become a part of the Earn While You Learn Program even before coming to India.
13/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Yes please.
13/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: I hope you too are following, Valery?
13/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 528 0118: yes I'm following
13/12/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So far, do you have queries?
13/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 71 528 0118: no I'm understanding very well
13/12/23, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
13/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 71 528 0118: yes I am
13/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: Valery, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
13/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
13/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 528 0118: 1500-2250
13/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
13/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
13/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: You see, Valery, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
13/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 528 0118: yes I  think so
13/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
13/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
13/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 528 0118: so is it always 350
13/12/23, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: No please, the fee hikes as approach the intakes.
13/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 528 0118: ohh okay
13/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
13/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
13/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
13/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
13/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 528 0118: I understand
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 528 0118: the way the girls talk about the program it seems to be fulfilling its promises and helping through out
13/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 528 0118: okay thank you
13/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Valery
13/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 71 528 0118: yes I do recall her
13/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: How did you like her video?
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 528 0118: it's very motivating
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
13/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
13/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
13/12/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Stay Blessed! <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 528 0118: thank you very much
13/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Valery
13/12/23, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: I wish you and Mrs and Mr Juru a very blessed day ahead.
13/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Sorry  to take you back ,are we suppose to pay 350 this December  for Valery to be eligible  for 2025 August intake
13/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: The payments are made in installments once/if Valery is found eligible for the program please.

Once she is accepted into the program, she would begin with her discussions with the Admissions Officer as well as EWYL mentor,

While this would help her earn credits as well as choose her university too, this gives parents time to prepare for the child's international higher education.

Considering the mental pressure on student while studies are going on, she won't have to worry about her higher education as she would have already completed the process.
13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you an even better clarity.
13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
13/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 286 6794: OK thank you ,looking forward to  the next session  tomorrow
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please, Mrs Grace.

Do connect with Mrs Ruth as well.
13/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 286 6794: OK l will contact  her now
13/12/23, 1:49 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, you can call her directly as well.

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

14/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes and we are very  thankful  for that
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

14/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 21st  or 22nd December 2023 for $200 and the 21st  or 22nd of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 21st  or 22nd December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

18/12/23, 9:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greeting to you *Mr. Juru Jethro , Mrs. Juru Grace and Juru Valery R’s*,

I have been actively involved in evaluating your application since the beginning of your sessions with our dedicated counselor. I must express my admiration for your commitment to supporting your child's higher education, a sentiment echoed not only in your application but also in the positive feedback received from your school authorities.

Having closely followed your journey, I am pleased to inform you that your interview was impressive, and I personally advocated for your selection during discussions with the Academic Board. Your dedication and enthusiasm have played a significant role in securing your eligibility for the scholarship.
18/12/23, 9:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family, *Mr. Juru Jethro and Mrs. Juru Grace as Juru Valery R’s* application was found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
18/12/23, 9:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Thank you thank you we are truly  grateful for the offer
19/12/23, 11:22 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
19/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Fine fine and you
19/12/23, 12:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your family go through this letter ?
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 528 0118: yes we did
19/12/23, 12:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you have any questions for me ?
19/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 286 6794: No we will contact Mr Jerera and make the payment
19/12/23, 2:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
19/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 286 6794: Yes
19/12/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
19/12/23, 3:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA
