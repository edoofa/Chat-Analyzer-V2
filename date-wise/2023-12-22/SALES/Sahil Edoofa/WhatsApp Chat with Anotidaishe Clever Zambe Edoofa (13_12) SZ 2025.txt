14/12/23, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
14/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes am really interested...India is a reputable country in terms of education so students from Indian universities are able to find high paying jobs and by studying in India where education is taken seriously i will be more skilled in what i want to focus on so by studying in India i can reach my self fulfilment in terms of skills and expertise
14/12/23, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
14/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 469 8702: 2000 to 3000 a year
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes they will sacrifice
14/12/23, 2:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Anotidaishe. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
14/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 469 8702: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Earn while you learn program
14/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Do you have any idea how that's done, please?
14/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes this program starts with the 3-month training program,during which, students are helped build 
the required technical skills like digital marketing, organization, management etc and 
soft skills like communication
skills, leadership, presentation skills, team work etc.in you. We are  then helped to get 
online work opportunities for us to learn employability skills while actually working 
part time after classes.
You also make sure that i get a quality education during the course of my degree,become 
employable with the help ofthe 3-month training and the 'Earn While You Learn' 
program,and develop the right attitude and mindset necessary for success in my chosen career and in life
14/12/23, 3:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Clever. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
14/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes i really do think so because it already gives me exposure to the working environment before i even finish my course
14/12/23, 3:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
14/12/23, 3:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
14/12/23, 3:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
14/12/23, 3:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

14/12/23, 3:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
14/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Wow
14/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes i do realise
14/12/23, 3:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
14/12/23, 3:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
14/12/23, 3:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
14/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Point number4:  Higher Education Concierge
14/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Clever! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
14/12/23, 3:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
14/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 469 8702: They are very excited
14/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Since they feel it's an opportunity for me to reach my full potential and as well be able to have exposure doing my education at a higher and quality level
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
14/12/23, 4:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
14/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes it is
14/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
14/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
14/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
14/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Okay great
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Anotidaishe Clever Zambe Edoofa (13/12) SZ" to "Anotidaishe Clever Zambe Edoofa (13/12) SZ 2025"
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 387 0447: Great
14/12/23, 4:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
14/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Okay
14/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Okay
14/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 387 0447: Edoofa will reduce the cost of learning in India to 2000-3000 a yr but through the Earn while you Learn program these costs can also be reduced to a greater extent if my child proves to be hard working in these projects
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 469 8702: We have discussed stages 1,2,3,4 and we I am at stage 5 (which is the financial planning for the entire tertiary education
14/12/23, 4:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
14/12/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes
14/12/23, 4:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
14/12/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes i am
14/12/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
15/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 469 8702: Good morning
15/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 469 8702: Yes we are good to go
15/12/23, 11:46 am - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
15/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 469 8702: It went well and yes my questions were effectively addressed by him
15/12/23, 11:48 am - Sahil Edoofa: ​​May I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members, and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
15/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 469 8702: We discussed about the importance of me having my education abroad especially in India and they would want to know what might make it possible for me to get a fully funded scholarship or one which is above 50%
15/12/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What according to you is fully funded scholarship ?
15/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 469 8702: A scholarship whereby all my university fees is paid by the scholarship program
15/12/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay did anyone from your family get such opportunity ?
15/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 469 8702: No in my family got such an opportunity
15/12/23, 12:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you come across anyone who got such opportunity ever?
15/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Most of the people i talked to said it's hard to find
15/12/23, 12:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: The only reason is that because only 5-10 people across the globe get it in one year that too who have all time 100% result throughout from form 1 to A level
15/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Okay i understand
15/12/23, 12:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
15/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 469 8702: She  said she was helped a lot by the 50% scholarship for example when the fees is $6000 thousand my parents can pay 3000 but i should follow all instructions as well as make sure that i do the Earn While You Learn program since it helps reduces the cost burden to my mother.....She also gave strong emphasis on not changing behaviour when we go abroad or be reluctant for example by not doing the Earn While You Learn program since it will only burden my mother
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 387 0447: It's a program that gives you 50 percent scholarship and above

 And it gives you enough time to prepare for your higher education
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 387 0447: Just follow their instructions
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 387 0447: We don't have any problems with the program
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 387 0447: If it wasn't Edoofa program we wouldn't be able to make it
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 387 0447: There is also EWYL program it helps to reduce fees costs
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 387 0447: Fees you pay the balance inenge yasara after you get the scholarship percentage
15/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 387 0447: We also made a phone call and had a good conversation with her
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
15/12/23, 1:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!
15/12/23, 1:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes i have watched the video and i saw how Africans especially my fellow Zimbabweans are happy to be proud Edoofians and i believe that Edoofa is there to change lives

This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

15/12/23, 2:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: And are they ready for the same ?
15/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes
15/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes they are ready
15/12/23, 2:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you share with me or do you want me to share then with you ?
15/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Early application will make preparations be done without pressure since there will be no hurry and if i am enrolled in the Edoofa program i can start my Earn While You Learn program now
15/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Opting for early enrollment brings forth several noteworthy advantages:

Exclusive Access to Scholarships: Edoofa scholarships are in high demand, and early enrollment ensures that your child has exclusive access to the financial support offered by our scholarship program.

Seat Assurance: Early enrollment guarantees your child a confirmed seat in the program, eliminating any potential competition for seats as the intake date approaches. This proactive approach ensures a smooth and stress-free admission process.

Ample Time for Preparation: The one and a half years leading up to the August 2025 intake provide a generous timeframe for meticulous preparation. This spans document verification, visa processing, and any academic preparations needed, contributing to a seamless transition.

Strategic Financial Planning: Enrolling early facilitates strategic financial planning. You gain the flexibility to explore various funding options, including the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, enabling you to establish a robust and stable financial plan for your child's education.

Fee Consistency Guarantee: Early enrollment secures the current fees, offering a consistent and predictable cost structure throughout the course. This shields against potential fee increases in the future.

Furthermore, admission for the August 2025 Intake opens up an opportune period for your child to make the most of this time:

Early Engagement in EWYL Program: A head start of over 20 months provides your child with a distinct advantage in the EWYL program. This time allows for a comprehensive understanding of projects and assignments, enabling the earning of scholarship credits even before arriving in India.(For example even if your child earns $100 a month he or she can self finance entire before even coming to India like many student often do let me share video of one such student )

Effective Communication with Admissions Team: Parents can proactively engage with the Admissions Team, focusing on financial planning and addressing any potential challenges. This proactive approach ensures a well-prepared international education journey for your child.

Community Integration: Becoming part of the Edoofa community early on allows students to connect with high achievers and toppers in their respective fields. This interaction proves invaluable for academic queries, potentially reducing the need for additional tuitions hence saving your cost for tutors.

Considering these factors, early enrollment not only secures the scholarship but also provides a substantial timeframe for thorough preparation and strategic planning.

How are you doing today?
16/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Afternoon sir we are doing great
16/12/23, 12:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Noted
16/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Okay thank you
16/12/23, 1:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did parents go through this?
16/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 387 0447: Yes we did
16/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes they did
18/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 469 8702: Morning sir, l am doing great
18/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 469 8702: How are you there
18/12/23, 11:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
18/12/23, 11:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
18/12/23, 11:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
18/12/23, 11:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 11:54 am - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 23rd   or 24th December 2023 for $200 and the 23rd   or 24th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 23rd   or 24th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
18/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 387 0447: True situation in our country

How are you doing today?
21/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 469 8702: Morning sir i am doing great
21/12/23, 12:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your family go through your acceptance letter ?
21/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yes we did
21/12/23, 12:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me ?
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 469 8702: So will i start my Earn While You Learn program after paying the first 200 or after finishing the whole 350
21/12/23, 2:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can start after payment of first $200
21/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Okay thank you sir
21/12/23, 2:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
21/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 469 8702: Yea it will be greatly appreciated sir
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828
