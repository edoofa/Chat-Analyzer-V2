15/11/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/11/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage.*

I wish you a blessed evening ahead.
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same, I would also be sharing a video for you to learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.
15/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 324 9174: Yes we can start
16/11/23, 9:13 am - Harmehak: Mr Mavis were you able to go through the shared information yesterday please?
16/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 324 9174: I am Mrs, yes I did

16/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 757 2788: Hallo

It's great to know of your kind act of supporting your sister's children.
16/11/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Hello Samuel

16/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: Your kind words are appreciated please.
16/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: So now as we proceed, 

I would like to know Samuel better as a student!

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies?
16/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 324 9174: Samuel is doing form 5 at the moment, he's a very humble, enthusiastic. He's very calm,. His hobbies are quiz and volleyball
16/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 324 9174: He's more interested in computers
16/11/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: That's great,

It's a pleasure to know about him, Mrs Mavis.

I am delighted to see his inclination towards Computers.
16/11/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 324 9174: He's a hard working student who always aims to be on top of his grades, he's currently doing sciences
16/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 276 4805: Samuel is hardworking boy...in terms of education he strives for high grades in all his academic subject. His hobbies are volleyball and quiz just to mention a few since alot have been already said.
16/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 324 9174: I am confident that he will do his best
16/11/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: That's well put across, Mrs Mavis and Mr Huni!

It's great to know more about Samuel.
16/11/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: May I know his current subject combination at school please?
16/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 324 9174: He's doing maths, physics and chemistry
16/11/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: That's an interesting subject combination!

I believe he is intrigued towards pursuing Engineering in Computer sector?
16/11/23, 10:13 am - +263 78 324 9174: He's been talking about engineering and doctrate
16/11/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please.

So since he is also intrigued towards Doctorate, why didn't he opt for Biology as well?
16/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 324 9174: I think he took the subjects he's more interested in
16/11/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Oh alright, however wouldn't you agree with me that Biology is a rather crucial subject for Doctorate?

Considering you have to learn about human body, isn't it, Mr Mavis?
16/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 324 9174: Yes biology is a crucial subject
16/11/23, 10:27 am - Harmehak: Very correct
16/11/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
16/11/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 324 9174: I understand,
16/11/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Mrs Mavis, in Samuel's student file, I can see he opted for Engineering itself please.
16/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 324 9174: OK
16/11/23, 10:31 am - Harmehak: So did he happen to discuss with you or Mr Huni regarding the field he would like to opt for in Engineering?
16/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 324 9174: I might not be able to be specific, computer engineering
16/11/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: That's alright please,

Let me brief you about his desired course.
16/11/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Computer Science Engineering* is an engineering undergraduate course in computer sciences

16/11/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 324 9174: Well briefed
16/11/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I am delighted please,

So Mrs Mavis, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 324 9174: Tell us why
16/11/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

16/11/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I am glad you do, Mrs Mavis 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
16/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 324 9174: I'm not familiar
16/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Alright please
16/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 324 9174: I appreciate for making me understanding
16/11/23, 11:46 am - Harmehak: In simple words, Mrs Mavis, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
16/11/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: You can let me know if you have followed, please.
16/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 324 9174: Sorry, l am following perfectly
16/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: That's great
16/11/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Mavis, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 324 9174: I agree with you
16/11/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Mrs Mavis!

So given the costs are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
16/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 324 9174: I understand
16/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
16/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/11/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

16/11/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 324 9174: OK, understood
16/11/23, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 324 9174: Yes you are different
16/11/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Mrs Mavis, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would be concluded in 10-15 minutes itself.

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 324 9174: Yes I am ready
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Mavis, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 78 324 9174: $1,500 to$2,250
16/11/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Mavis, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 324 9174: I think so
16/11/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
16/11/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 324 9174: This program is for 2024_ 25, Samuel is writing next year, is possible for him to be in the program
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Its for 2024-2025 admissions please.
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: We are in the discussion for Samuel's intake itself.
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 324 9174: Now I understand
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 324 9174: I am following
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 324 9174: Thank you for your help, thank you for giving Mrs magwaza s number. She'll be able to help me out, as her kids are already that side
16/11/23, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct Mrs Mavis.
16/11/23, 1:32 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
16/11/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/11/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

16/11/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings to you
How are you doing today?
Kindly excuse me for the delay there is some issue with my device today.
09/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 324 9174: Hallo Edoofa
09/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 324 9174: It's ok, we can do it tomorrow,
09/12/23, 2:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me guide you
09/12/23, 3:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
09/12/23, 3:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
