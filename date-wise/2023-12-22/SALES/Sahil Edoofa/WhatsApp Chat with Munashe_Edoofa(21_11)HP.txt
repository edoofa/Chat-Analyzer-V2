22/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 509 0620: It's Ok. I will be waiting
22/11/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 509 0620: Yes, he told me about that program
22/11/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: That's great
22/11/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Eriday, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you better as parent. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
22/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Ok
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 509 0620: My name is Eridah Mukondyo.l'm a single parent and l'm a vendor in Mutare Manicaland and l'm want my son to go to Edoofa University and l will try to support him with whatever he wants for his education
22/11/23, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Well received Mrs Eriday, Its a pleasure to know about you!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
22/11/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: I would like to know about Munashe!

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies, along with anything that you would like to share about him?
22/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Munashe is a young boy aged 21. He did his Ordinary level and Advanced level at Kushingirira High School in Bikita, Masvingo. He was a obedient, honest and hard working boy. He obtained 7 subjects including Mathematics and English. He wrote his Advanced level this year. He was doing Commercials..Statistics, Geography and Business Studies.
22/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 509 0620: He interested in studying hard  because he used to say i have a lot of dreams i need to fulfill and he likes to play *chess*, *watching television* and at sometimes *soccer*
22/11/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Mrs Eriday!

It's a pleasure to know more about him 

He surely seems to be a hardworking and a dedicated student.
22/11/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
22/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 509 0620: It's Ok. I heard what you said.
Thank you!.
 Yes, I'm confident enough because he was working very hard towards his areas of learning
22/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Yes, he is well dedicated and a hardworking boy.
22/11/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

22/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Oooh thank you for such amazing rich information. I'm also glad to through...I'm also learning a lot about this program
22/11/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Eriday.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Yes, I fully understand, No we're not familiar as such
22/11/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
22/11/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Thank you
22/11/23, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mrs Eriday, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
22/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 509 0620: It's Ok.
Thank you. I understand
22/11/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
22/11/23, 3:16 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Eriday, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
22/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 509 0620: That's good
22/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Yes I do agree
22/11/23, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: So after going through these costs and comparing the same to those in Zimbabwe, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Eriday?
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Yes
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 509 0620: I'm now in a better position
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

23/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Eriday, are you following the discussion?

I am expecting to hear from you please!
23/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Yes l'm following
23/11/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright, however kindly ensure active participation so that we conclude the discussion too please.
23/11/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Ok
23/11/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: You can go through this video please, I believe it would provide you with great clarity.
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Ok
23/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
23/11/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Yes l'm ready
23/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Eriday, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 509 0620: 1500-0
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 509 0620: $1500-$2250
23/11/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mrs Eriday, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Ok it a good price
23/11/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: Now it's $350 itself please.
23/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 509 0620: l do
23/11/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/11/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Ok thanks great then
23/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: It's great to have you acknowledge please.
23/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/11/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Yes I have understood
23/11/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/11/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

23/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Ok ok it's good
23/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Ok
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 509 0620: ok thanks you alot l will get in touch with her
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Surely, Mrs Eriday!
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email , and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
05/12/23, 10:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:59 pm - +263 78 256 0670: Yes i do
06/12/23, 11:00 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
06/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 256 0670: Im good. How are you today as well
06/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 256 0670: Can you please explain further for me about the payments. I didn't understand properly
06/12/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
06/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 256 0670: Yes, may you please
06/12/23, 2:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
06/12/23, 2:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

06/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 256 0670: Thank you for the information. What i want to know again is that..when is the due date of payments because as for now my parent is really bankrupt. She don't have money
06/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your parents not go through the acceptance letter carefully ? as everything was mentioned there

09/12/23, 12:58 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings to you
How are you doing today?
Kindly excuse me for the delay there is some issue with my device today.
09/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 509 0620: This message was deleted
09/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 509 0620: Not yet as for now, but I think will in the beginning January month
09/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 509 0620: It's Ok...it's not a problem
09/12/23, 4:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you elaborate ?
10/12/23, 12:10 am - +263 77 509 0620: Elaboration about what???
11/12/23, 10:38 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
11/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 256 0670: Fine and you?
11/12/23, 11:06 am - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Munashe's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Munashe's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
11/12/23, 8:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

And there is no other means I can acquire the money because I'm a single mother. I'm supporting my children alone. There is no one who can give me money as for now.  Cash inflow is very low to an extent that I don't have money as for now. But I'm thinking next year it will be well as I'm expecting. I don't know how to take it ,but things are not well and normal.
14/12/23, 2:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: We gave you flexible plan but I have not seen any efforts from your end we never give extensions to anyone but considering your conditions we approved extensions so considering there is no efforts from your end why would we consider your application again ?

If you put yourself in her shoes you would understand her. My mother is really struggling for now. To be honestly with you things are very very tight. Please  can you give a quite time to look for money if you're strenuous to. Im now asking on behalf of her. Her phone is not functioning well as for now.
