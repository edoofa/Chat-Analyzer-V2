12/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 714 6734: Its a good start this morning

12/10/23, 10:41 am - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! The combination of athletics and academics is indeed exquisite. You have expressed everything vividly, Kabongwe. I commend your aspiration to make significant advancements in the field of biotechnology, which has the potential to shape the future of healthcare and science. I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed some light on the educational background of your brother, please?
12/10/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 714 6734: My brother holds a National Diploma in Environmental Health and he's currently working as a Environmental Health Technician... 
He now has his own family.
12/10/23, 10:48 am - +91 82875 72068: That is really impressive, Kabongwe! It's wonderful to hear that he has started his own family!
12/10/23, 10:49 am - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. You mentioned that you completed your Bachelor's at Parul University. May I kindly inquire whether you successfully secured employment following the completion of your degree?
12/10/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 714 6734: Unfortunately i have not had any luck in securing any employment but i have been applying to different companies hoping for a breakthrough
12/10/23, 12:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. Could you please share the reasons for not currently being employed? I would appreciate your insights. Could you kindly explain the reasons behind your decision not to pursue a master's degree at Parul University, please?
12/10/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 714 6734: From the feedback i have gotten on my reason of not being employable, the frequent reply is that i lack industrial or hands on experience in the field as i did not get to do any internship. 

My decision to not persue Masters in Parul was because i wanted to seek hands on experience first before going higher education but that journey had not been a successful one, therefore i now seek to do a program that can offer internship as well in order to gain experience
12/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Also the fact that i finished my degree during COVID times made it difficult to pursue anything further
12/10/23, 1:00 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. It's important to note that Parul University does not possess global recognition. Consequently, the degree you earn from this institution will not be internationally recognized, potentially rendering your investment of time and money to yield no outcome. As your concierge, my primary goal is to provide you with accurate guidance. It's reassuring to note that Edoofa is a government-recognized organization with a strong global reputation for delivering high-quality education. This highlights one of the key factors contributing to the preference of multinational corporations to hire graduates from other institutions, ultimately leading to a comparatively lower placement rate for Parul University. Furthermore, I'm pleased to inform you that Edoofa has received recognition from the First Lady of Zimbabwe. We have worked with over 250 globally renowned and internationally accredited universities. In my capacity as your counselor, I kindly advise against enrolling in an institution that may not offer the same level of recognition and value.
12/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Well understood, unfortunately i did not get the same guidance before making the decision
12/10/23, 1:09 pm - +91 82875 72068: It will be my utmost pleasure to assist you, Kabongwe!
12/10/23, 1:10 pm - +91 82875 72068: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Parul University* charged you every semester, and who in your family financially supported your education?
12/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you
12/10/23, 1:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: Can you please acknowledge this question?
12/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Apologies, i was charged per year which was at $2000USD 
My mother financed mymy education
12/10/23, 1:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
12/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 714 6734: My mother is the one financing my education abroad
12/10/23, 1:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Ms. Dube is an extraordinary parent, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and her dedication to your well-being is truly admirable! Well, before we move ahead with your course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad. Also please share pictures of your bachelor's transcripts for evaluation?
12/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 714 6734: My motivation to study abroad is influenced by the need for exposure considering that there a new trends and advancements within the science field and i  want to be part of that and in that field considering the exposure level within my country, i feel it is inadequate therefore the need to study abroad..
12/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 714 6734: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 714 6734: <Media omitted>

12/10/23, 5:09 pm - +91 82875 72068: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Kabongwe.
12/10/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I have gone through the information. Truly great things and innovations  are emerging from India and it only leaves desire and the zeal to want to be part of these great thing. Great people doing the most from India shows that its also possible for me, it gives me the desire to work harder.
12/10/23, 5:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am delighted to hear that, Kabongwe! After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
12/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, my interest just peeked even higher. 
Considering the renowned universities in India and their global recognition, i believe with a degree from such a renowned country it gives me the opportunity to gain access and placement to highly recognized institutions which puts me a step closer to achieving my goals and helps me gain high quality experience and expertise in the field
12/10/23, 6:15 pm - +91 82875 72068: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
12/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 714 6734: In India or in general?
12/10/23, 6:26 pm - +91 82875 72068: In general, Kabongwe.
12/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I'm not versed  in the cost but from my comparison between education in Africa and  Europe the range is from  $1500 to  $30000
12/10/23, 6:53 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/10/23, 6:53 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 6:53 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
12/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 714 6734: For quality education it seems to be a fair amount but as for affordability in my family, its is a struggle to say say, yes its an affordable amount as I had to delay furthering my education due to the financial struggles
12/10/23, 7:00 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well Kabongwe, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
12/10/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes that sounds really impressive. .. No I'm not familiar with the idea... Care to shed light to it?
12/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
12/10/23, 7:05 pm - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
12/10/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 714 6734: This opportunity sounds very enticing and beneficial to me as a student, it allows for exposure and experience in fields even different from selected area of study which ensures that the student is always in touch with the ever evolving world. 
Yes, this would be beneficial to me. <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 7:24 pm - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
12/10/23, 7:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
12/10/23, 7:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
12/10/23, 7:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

12/10/23, 7:26 pm - +91 82875 72068: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, this seems like a great opportunity which requires dedication and hard work. 
It is all possible.
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
12/10/23, 7:45 pm - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
12/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I appreciate the guidance and counseling, Earn while you learn program which help reduce financial burdens, i also appreciate the placement and internship assistance its of great help as it helps to get first hand experience and the utmost involvement in all the processes which gives a feeling of being supported.
12/10/23, 8:29 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am delighted to hear that, Kabongwe. One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
12/10/23, 8:29 pm - +91 82875 72068: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
12/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 714 6734: They are on board though they are worried about me being far away from home and in case of any unforeseeable circumstances that may end being a barrier in any type of support, they are looking for reassurance in my safety and well being
12/10/23, 8:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
12/10/23, 8:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: I totally understand your concern, Kabongwe. As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
12/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Thank you that would be lovely. May i find out if there's medical aid, legal aid and all involved in such things. How does Edoofa assist in that
12/10/23, 9:02 pm - +91 82875 72068: Can you please elaborate the term "Legal Aid", please?
12/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 714 6734: More like, i may get sick and in need of medical assistance how does Edoofa assist, i may get mugged or be in a situation that requires legal assistance.. Situations that people rarely prepare for
12/10/23, 9:09 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. It's worth mentioning that our universities have highly skilled medical professionals who provide free treatment for minor illnesses.
12/10/23, 9:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: Furthermore, India boasts a robust legal system that offers comprehensive legal assistance and support people, ensuring justice and protection of their rights. In tandem with this, the dedicated police force diligently upholds law and order, safeguarding the well-being and security of the nation's diverse population!
12/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 714 6734: And if a bigger illness, say it requires minor surgery, be it an accident or extensive medical care is there any assistance. Or Maybe situations like the COVID pandemic that affected a lot of people is there and medical aid or assistance in that situation. Apologies if the questions are too much, but its so the family is assured of everything.
12/10/23, 9:20 pm - +91 82875 72068: I can understand your concern, Kabongwe. In the event of a major illness, your family's support and care would be invaluable. Rest assured, we will continue to offer our assistance and guidance until your family is well-informed and able to take over the situation.
12/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Well understood. So does Edoofa assist in any of the legal proceedings
12/10/23, 9:27 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. Our dedicated *Department of Student Welfare* will be there to assist you!
12/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 714 6734: If  i understand correctly, there is no medical aid in place, the family would have to be chip in a be of financial assistance. The university helps freely treat minor illness? May i know if services like dental care, eye care, medication from the pharmacy etc are part of the university treatment or thats a personal cost?
12/10/23, 9:31 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. I will have to inform you that is a personal cost, please.
12/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Ok , well understood. As a family we feel comfortable with transparency, so as to make informed decisions. 
Thank you.
12/10/23, 9:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: It will be my utmost pleasure to assist you, Kabongwe!
12/10/23, 9:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
12/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I agree with that and maybe transcripts so as to assess the eligibility of the student <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 9:37 pm - +91 82875 72068: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
12/10/23, 9:37 pm - +91 82875 72068: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
12/10/23, 9:38 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 9:38 pm - +91 82875 72068: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
12/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I'm following, please continue
12/10/23, 9:44 pm - +91 82875 72068: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
12/10/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Is there any guarantee of  getting admissions should i start the process?
12/10/23, 9:48 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. As I have mentioned, if you are found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receive the Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the enrollment of payable amount of $350. However, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
12/10/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Is it mandatory that you start within the 7 days or you are given a window period
12/10/23, 9:57 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. After receiving the Acceptance Letter, you will be receiving a time span of 7 days to pay the first part, please. However, under a few inevitable conditions, the board is open to giving a certain extension to the student.
12/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Well understood. This is so as to allow the family time to make a full decision. 
I noticed rounds in applications is it possible that in the event of unpreparedness one asks to join a different round of application to avoid seeming inconsistent and therefore giving time to be fully prepared and well informed for the process? Is so what are the consequences?
12/10/23, 10:03 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. A student will have to follow the admission cycle for the respective round.
12/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Meaning i start afresh with the evaluation and counseling sessions?
12/10/23, 10:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: Certainly, Kabongwe.
12/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Understood... So is there something to be done to initiate the process of evaluating eligibility? Or its automatic? If so how long after evaluation and counseling thst is takefir the process to start
12/10/23, 10:20 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Kabongwe, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
12/10/23, 10:20 pm - +91 82875 72068: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
12/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 78 714 6734: From what i gathered from the discussion starting from admission;

The student is to pay $350 within 7 of receiving the acceptance letter form  make a payment pain where $200 in a space of 7 days and $150 is payable in a space  of 30 days. 

Tuition, accommodation etc, the scholarship all with cover about 50% and more depending on the given scholarship... The range after scholarship is 2000 to 3000. This can also be lowered down by being part of the Earn While Learning program which  takes of the financial strain
12/10/23, 10:32 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
12/10/23, 10:36 pm - +263 78 714 6734: During the enrollment process may i know if total is at 350 or its 2 different process therefore it being bot being  700
12/10/23, 10:37 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. It is a total of $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days . For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350 <This message was edited>
12/10/23, 10:39 pm - +91 82875 72068: May I know whether it is clear, please?
12/10/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes its now cleared up and well understood. Thank you for taking your time to guidee. Apologies, as i will be offline to rest as i have commitments early morning. 
Thank you for the wonderful session.
12/10/23, 10:44 pm - +91 82875 72068: It will be my utmost pleasure to guide you, Kabongwe! However, I would request you to be active for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session.
12/10/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Ok, i can do that.
12/10/23, 10:45 pm - +91 82875 72068: I appreciate your sincerity, Kabongwe!
12/10/23, 10:45 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I'm at the first stage, the personalized counseling stage
12/10/23, 10:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
12/10/23, 10:47 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes please do, so that tomorrow we start a different  issue
12/10/23, 10:47 pm - +91 82875 72068: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$750) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
12/10/23, 10:52 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes it is clear. While on that is there a way to start acquiring scholarship credits at home so as to be ahead on the payment by August?
12/10/23, 10:54 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kabongwe. Every student embarks on their *Earn While You Learn* journey from Zimbabwe. What's more, they will have a dedicated mentor by their side, offering continuous guidance and support!
12/10/23, 10:56 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/10/23, 10:56 pm - +91 82875 72068: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

13/10/23, 7:51 am - +263 78 714 6734: To initiate the whole process do i as student do it or Edoofa does it?
13/10/23, 7:55 am - +263 78 714 6734: Good morning, apologies for the late response. Today i will be occupied which gives me little time to give full attention to the phone. May i advise that yes i  will get time to respond but not as efficiently as required apologies
13/10/23, 10:07 am - +91 82875 72068: Good Morning,

13/10/23, 12:42 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

How are you doing today?
21/10/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 714 6734: We are doing quite well and you?
21/10/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 285 1393: Good afternoon friends
21/10/23, 2:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263772851393 , Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
21/10/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 285 1393: Am somewhat agreeable.   Looking at my situation  l have other children  that l also look after l real struggle  to have them go to school.
21/10/23, 7:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So how are you planning things now ?
21/10/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 285 1393: I am currently  serving  or putting aside 40 - $50 a month   with the hope  that l will be able to find a scholarship  fir my daughter.

31/10/23, 11:09 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
31/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 78 714 6734: I'm doing well and you?
31/10/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
31/10/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

31/10/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
31/10/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 6th or 7th November 2023 for $200 and the 6th or 7th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 6th or 7th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
31/10/23, 1:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents please answer using voice notes ?
31/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 285 1393: <Media omitted>

Shall I get you the slots for today?
31/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 285 1393: May l have a slot for tomorrow  between 10:00a.m and 10:30a.m

04/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 714 6734: kabongweksibanda1218@yahoo.com
04/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I have a question

From my understanding of this document, if i fail to pay the registration within 7 days you revoke my acceptance and if I'm re-applying i am supposed to pay $500 USD should they still be sits available is this correct? 

Be it that i miss the chance to carry on with enrollment for the year 2024-2025, what procedure is there for the following year?
06/11/23, 11:44 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning,

I hope your weekend provided you with the opportunity to rejuvenate. Are you ready to continue our session for today?
06/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes
06/11/23, 1:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: There is no second chance or you have to pay $750 as penalty.
06/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Ok ok understood,
06/11/23, 1:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions from the acceptance letter ?
06/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 78 714 6734: This was the question i had. But to understand what is the penalty for should i be unable to pay now? 
And how do i receive proof of payment after payment? Or how do you acknowledge the payment?
06/11/23, 1:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know if you have any challenges in making the payments now ?
06/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, i will be unable to pay by the deadline, considering the recent travels and that we recently cleared fees for my nephews that we stay with, therefore the payment is a bit  too strenuous
06/11/23, 3:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What financial budgeting have parents done for you personally for masters abroad ?
06/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 714 6734: We recently started the journey for abroad, we didn't think the payments will come this soon... We thought payment times will be around January, that way we would have tried to gather the best we can taking advantage of the festive season
06/11/23, 3:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you already have experience of international planning and payments as you already did Bachelors abroad ?
06/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, and we had started planning and paying for that around February after i received my A level results, hence why we thought the payment time frame will cone a little late and we had pegged it around January
06/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What challenges did you face that time ?
06/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I would say almost similar challenges but it was manageable because the payment deadline gave us enough time to make payment without pressure
06/11/23, 3:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know then why did you not apply at Parul university this time ?
06/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Sibanda's, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Sibanda's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
06/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 714 6734: I wanted a public\government university which has more chances of global recognition
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 714 6734: Yes, we can discuss the solution
06/11/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Sibanda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Sibanda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?@263772851393 @263787146734
06/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 714 6734: It does sound convenient, i will hear what mom says with this solution
06/11/23, 4:06 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
06/11/23, 11:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 285 1393: Just to understand  after this we still need to go back to rhe eligibility check.
07/11/23, 12:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: She already is found eligible
07/11/23, 6:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you following?
08/11/23, 11:33 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
May I know what challenges are you facing so that I can plan your session accordingly.
08/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 714 6734: I had raised a question regarding the proof of payments
08/11/23, 12:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please elaborate ?
08/11/23, 12:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
08/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 714 6734: To my understanding, i can either transfer to someone in Zimbabwe or to you directly.  My question is where and how do i get confirmation for receipt of payment
08/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
08/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

How are you doing today?
21/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 285 1393: Good morning.  Am currently  travelling to  make part payment  as per our agreement.  Once done will post you the proof of payment into Mr Jerera's Account.
21/12/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay please
21/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 285 1393: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you not pay the transfer fees ?
21/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 285 1393: No is a local transfer it has no charges.
21/12/23, 12:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please go through once
21/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 285 1393: I am not getting you? May explain for me.
21/12/23, 1:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
21/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 285 1393: Just to understand.  So from now you can go ahead eith the process of the admission cycle.
21/12/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes
21/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 285 1393: What is the next step now.
21/12/23, 2:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Admission team will soon start your next session
