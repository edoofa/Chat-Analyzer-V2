05/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 727 2600: From my understanding Edoofa is a platform for vulnerable students to pursue Affordable Higher Education in India through Scholarships .
05/12/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Amin, so now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
06/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 727 2600: My name is Amin Ali Chirambira a lower six student at St Anthonys Mission in Zaka district in Masvingo province in Zambabwe. l am 17 years old. l did my ordinary level at St Anthonys Mission. l did 15 subjects and out of the fifteen subjects l passed them all with 9 A grades ,5 B grades and 1 C grade. l am a person who is more into the world of technology, so l have decided to carry Computer Science as part of of my combination alongside with Physics, Chemistry, Pure Mathematics, Mechanical Mathematics. As l grew up l have come to a point of knowing my strengths as a student. I have discovered that physics and computer science are my favourate and  where my strength is based on. As a result coding, software development and experimenting has become part of my hobbies. Out of the cyber world which l love, l also play tennis as part of my hobbies. l as a student my dream is to become a world recognised software engineer if l have the chance to pursue with my education.

l grew up in a small family of four, that is l, my mother and father and my little sister. My father Mr J Chirambira is a mathematics teacher at Vainona high school in harare and my mother is also a mathematics teacher at Ellis  Robins boys high which is also in harare. My mother has a bachelors degree in education and my father has a masters degree in education. My sister Faith Chirambira is still in primary level, she is in grade 6 this year.
06/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Well received and well explained Amin, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

Along with the same I can see you come from a family that greatly values education and your parents being teachers is the perfect example.

I would like to appreciate your thorough awareness of your interests and what exactly you would like to study later.
06/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 727 2600: As a student who is chasing his dreams of being a recognised software engineer one day, l would like study anything in the computer world that would help me pave my way like software engineering
06/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: That's great and we look forward to you achieving great heights, Amin.
06/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Well Amin now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
06/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 727 2600: on my side having my higher education abroad offers  chances to see where the world is hearding in terms of technology. Its also offers a diverse experience of other cultures. Yes l believe it's a life changing decision because it helps you to get connected to the world
06/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Amin.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
06/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 727 2600: l would say l am mentally prepared for the abroad life
06/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: That's great
06/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
06/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 727 2600: l am confident enough that l will aim higher
06/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: That's the spirit, Amin.

06/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 727 2600: yes l did and they helped me know more facts about lndia which l didn't know
06/12/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Amin.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
06/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 727 2600: yes l am aware
06/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Could you please your knowledge?
06/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 727 2600: Sorry l didn't get your question <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Could you please share your knowledge of the costs, Amin?
06/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 727 2600: for  a start it may cost something like 3500 including the tikect and visa
06/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 727 2600: the for the following siemesters it would cost about 1500 us dollars
06/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
06/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 727 2600: oky thats great
06/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
06/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 727 2600: that would be great especially the Earn while you learn program
06/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
06/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/12/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

06/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Amin.
06/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 727 2600: thank you l got the sense
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 727 2600: yes l can see your uniqueness
06/12/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Amin,now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 727 2600: yes l am ready
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: Amin, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/12/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 727 2600: 1500 -2250
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: You see, Amin, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 727 2600: that would be a great idea
06/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
06/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 727 2600: oky
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 727 2600: yes got the sense
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Did you have a thorough reading, Amin?
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 727 2600: l still reading
06/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Amin.

Meanwhile do you have any queries for me?
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 727 2600: no but if will have any later l will come back to you
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Amin.
06/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
06/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 727 2600: that would be great
06/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/12/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well, Amin. <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 727 2600: l will
06/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

TOPIC: Is it true that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient?

Africa's diverse continent is home to a wide range of agricultural practices, and it is misleading to assert that many Africans have poor diets solely due to stagnant and inefficient farms. This essay aims to challenge this oversimplified narrative by examining the complexities of African agriculture and highlighting the multiple factors contributing to dietary challenges.

Africa encompasses numerous nations with varying climates, soil types, and farming methods, resulting in a rich tapestry of agricultural practices. From smallholder farmers practicing traditional methods to large-scale commercial operations embracing modern technologies, Africa's agricultural landscape is far from stagnant. Subsistence farming, while widespread, coexists with innovative approaches that drive productivity and sustainability.

The issue of poor diets in Africa is influenced by multifaceted socioeconomic factors. Limited access to markets, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of capital hinder farmers' ability to invest in modern technologies and improve their yields. Additionally, poverty and income inequality contribute to food insecurity and limited dietary diversity, as nutritious food often becomes a luxury beyond the reach of many Africans.

Africa faces significant environmental challenges that impact agricultural productivity. Climate change, desertification, and deforestation pose substantial hurdles for farmers across the continent. Erratic rainfall patterns, prolonged droughts, and increased pest and disease pressure disrupt farming systems, making it difficult to achieve consistent yields. These challenges are not solely due to inefficiency but require comprehensive and sustainable solutions that consider ecological resilience and adaptation.

The role of government policies and support cannot be overlooked when discussing agricultural productivity. Inadequate investment in rural infrastructure, limited access to credit, and insufficient extension services hinder the growth of the agricultural sector. By implementing policies that prioritize smallholder farmers, improve market access, and promote sustainable farming practices, governments can contribute to enhancing agricultural productivity and improving dietary outcomes.

The claim that many Africans have poor diets solely due to stagnant and inefficient farms oversimplifies the complex reality of African agriculture. By considering the diverse farming practices, socioeconomic factors, climate change challenges, and government policies, we can develop a more nuanced understanding and work towards sustainable solutions that address dietary challenges in Africa.

Amin embarked on a self-learning journey, devouring every bit of information he  could find about computer science. He would spend countless nights reading textbooks, watching online tutorials, and participating in coding competitions. His  room was adorned with sticky notes filled with algorithms and lines of code, a testament to her unwavering commitment.

Despite the challenges, Amin refused to give up. He sought out mentors and reached out to computer science professionals in neighboring cities, seeking guidance and advice. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and his passion for the subject began to catch the attention of those around him.

Under Mr Masvaya mentorship, Amin thrived. He worked tirelessly on cutting-edge projects, collaborating with brilliant minds from around the world. His dedication and talent shone through, and he quickly became an indispensable member of the team. Amin's innovative ideas and problem-solving skills were celebrated, and he started making valuable contributions to the field of computer science.

Amin's story is a testament to the power of determination and self-belief. Through his unwavering commitment, he transcended the limitations of his circumstances and turned his  dreams into reality. He legacy lives on, inspiring generations of computer science enthusiasts to follow their passions and make a meaningful impact on the world through technology.

16/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Can you please share if you are willing to support Amin's higher education in India mentally and financially through a voice note?
16/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 578 4563: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

21/12/23, 11:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
21/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 578 4563: Good morning
21/12/23, 12:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your family go through your acceptance letter ? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 727 2600: yes  we did thank you
21/12/23, 1:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you have any questions for me ?
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 727 2600: no if any l will come back to you
21/12/23, 2:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 727 2600: yes
21/12/23, 3:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
21/12/23, 3:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
