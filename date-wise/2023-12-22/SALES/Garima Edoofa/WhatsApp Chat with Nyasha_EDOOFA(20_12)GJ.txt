Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

21/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay will let you know after going through it
21/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Well understood ma'am,
21/12/23, 2:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India
21/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 495 4094: No may you please help
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
21/12/23, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

21/12/23, 2:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay ma'am
21/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Do you provide working permits as well
21/12/23, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Nyasha, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
21/12/23, 3:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Nyasha what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Okay thank you for the explanation
21/12/23, 3:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are you thoughts on the same?
21/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 3:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Please can you answer this question that I just asked?
21/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 495 4094: May you please explain to me ma'am I'm not understanding it
21/12/23, 3:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please I would like to understand your thoughts on the cost of education that Edoofa provides.
21/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 495 4094: okay, it's really helpful considering how the actual cost are without the help of Edoofa, and it really unleashes the burden for many students
21/12/23, 4:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Indeed Nyasha.
21/12/23, 4:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
21/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 495 4094: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 4:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 4:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 71 495 4094: That is fantastic
21/12/23, 4:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it.
