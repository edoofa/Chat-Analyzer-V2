20/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 385 0006: It's amazing although l didn't get to download all the pictures the cost of bundles is quite high
20/12/23, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand Original.
20/12/23, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
20/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 385 0006: Yes l understand
20/12/23, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Original, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
20/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 385 0006: Now India has the second largest growing economy in the world. Which means studying in India will help me diversify, copy with cultural change different personalities as well as offer a range of opportunities for my career of choice
20/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 385 0006: Because of its diversity l will be exposed to many opportunities and chances as well as work with humanitarian organizations which are many in India
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Original. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 385 0006: No
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

20/12/23, 3:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

21/12/23, 9:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263773654047 @263783850006 , hope you are having a great day.
21/12/23, 9:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Sorry for the delay as I was having a meeting with the academic board regarding your application.
21/12/23, 9:49 am - Garima Edoofa: Shall we start?
21/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 385 0006: Yes we may. Good morning
21/12/23, 10:27 am - Garima Edoofa: Did you go through this?
21/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 385 0006: Yes l did
21/12/23, 10:29 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know what you happen to understand?
21/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 385 0006: The cost of tertiary education in India is much affordable compared to other countries in Europe and Edoofa want to make it more affordable to parents through scholarship and through the Earn While You Learn program the fees can be further reduced
21/12/23, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 385 0006: Yes
21/12/23, 11:04 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Original what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/12/23, 11:05 am - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same?
21/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 385 0006: I think it is a great opportunity that Edoofa program is giving to students to further their education
21/12/23, 11:20 am - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
21/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 78 385 0006: Sure thing
21/12/23, 11:27 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/12/23, 11:27 am - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/12/23, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, it is my lunch break and we'll be connecting shortly after ONE HOUR.
21/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 385 0006: Well l am still waiting patiently
21/12/23, 3:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: So sorry for the delay in the response Original, as I was facing some technical issues.
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, shall we proceed now?
21/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 385 0006: Yes we may
21/12/23, 3:27 pm - Garima Edoofa: Did you go through this?
21/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 385 0006: Yes
21/12/23, 3:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright moving ahead with our discussion.
21/12/23, 3:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

21/12/23, 3:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
21/12/23, 3:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
21/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 385 0006: It's a great experience and l think it will also help me develop
21/12/23, 4:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please.
21/12/23, 4:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 385 0006: I understand
21/12/23, 4:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
21/12/23, 4:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
21/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 385 0006: The second one
21/12/23, 4:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Original, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
21/12/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 385 0006: Yes
21/12/23, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 9:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
