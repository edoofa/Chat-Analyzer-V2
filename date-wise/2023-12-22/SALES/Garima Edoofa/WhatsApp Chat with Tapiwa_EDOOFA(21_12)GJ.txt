*I am Garima career counselor at Edoofa and we have with us, Mr. Sahil, Senior Career Counselor, and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admission at Edoofa who will be evaluating your application.*

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *<NAME>* from Zimbabwe.

📅 Date: 21th December 2023 
🕤 Time: 9:00 PM CAT

Please mark this date and time on your calendar to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation. To prepare for our session, we encourage you to explore our website at [www.edoofa.com], the video and document shared along. This will provide you with valuable insights into our programs and opportunities. In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

I hope I have contacted the right person?
21/12/23, 6:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:00 AM CAT.*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:00 am to 4:30 pm on Monday to Friday, and from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm* on Saturday so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
