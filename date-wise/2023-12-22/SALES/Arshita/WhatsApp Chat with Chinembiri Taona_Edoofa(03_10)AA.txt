I want to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. *But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough resources and study materials due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting.Therefore, after the evaluations the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)*

Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
