You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

26/09/23, 3:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I hope you are well. It appears that you have missed the deadline for submitting your reviews and a referral form even after an amazing opportunity of earning $300!

It's disappointing that you couldn't spare even 10-15 minutes, especially after we discussed everything during our call. I hope you can share your reviews with me by tonight.

Please let me know if you won't be able to fulfill the requirement
26/09/23, 3:51 pm - +91 86996 80020: good evening maam,
I have the contacts of people interested in joining the program, but as you said during the meeting, its not about quantity , its about quality, l am doing the best l can to prep them for every stage so that , they become the ideal candidates for you, l only need more time, because due to the differences in time zones communication is a bit difficult with them
27/09/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Thubalami!

I understand, however you know you can take help of your parents.
27/09/23, 4:28 pm - +91 86996 80020: greetings maam, 
I hadn't thought of that, l will definitely do so
27/09/23, 4:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, you can ask them to share your personal experience with their groups as well.
27/09/23, 4:29 pm - +91 86996 80020: noted maam, 
l will do just that,
27/09/23, 4:32 pm - +91 86996 80020: most of the people l know are interested and have understood, are currently doing their lower six or grade11 and they are willing to apply and be part of the program a little earlier so that they have enough time for counselling sessions and career guidance at an early stage
27/09/23, 4:33 pm - +91 86996 80020: these ones will be appearing for their final exams next year, what should l say to them

This is a reminder that it is compulsory for you to inform your parents about the new *$300 plan* and ask for their confirmation on the EWYL group. We cannot proceed without their acknowledgment. Please take this matter seriously and ensure that your parents are informed promptly. 

*The deadline for this is today at 5:00 PM.*

03/10/23, 8:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:17 pm - +91 86996 80020: greetings maam, l did do my reviews on facebook and on google,

03/10/23, 8:18 pm - +91 86996 80020: I am really sorry on that one, 
I didn't get that l had to share a screenshot, cause l did my reviews the same day you told me to do so
03/10/23, 8:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So kindly share the screenshots now.
03/10/23, 8:23 pm - +91 86996 80020: okay maam

But l would love to share my story on Facebook, 
Was working on my profile first for a greater impact
04/10/23, 10:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's okay, kindly do it once again and share it with me.
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

 *Week 4*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

16/10/23, 8:15 am - +91 86996 80020: Good morning
I am doing that ma'am, have been doing that since day 1, that is why l was delaying the release of their form
18/10/23, 9:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

It's been a while, but we're back with our EWYL group session today at *7:00 PM*, and I couldn't be more thrilled! 🚀

So, set your alarms, mark your calendars, and make sure to join us on time. Let's make this session unforgettable!
18/10/23, 9:53 am - +91 86996 80020: Duly noted ma'am
18/10/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL group session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. 

To begin with, I believe you must have joined the Career Launch Pad group for your training and internship, haven't you?
18/10/23, 3:39 pm - +91 86996 80020: yes maam. I have
18/10/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, you know, while I was going through that group, I came across a very interesting Tech Tip Tuesday series! Did you see that too?
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - +91 86996 80020: chat GPT?
18/10/23, 3:48 pm - +91 86996 80020: I DID see it, l was introduced to the tools way earlier since l am studying exactly in that field
18/10/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Can you share any specific ways you think ChatGPT AI might be useful in your studies or future projects based on what we discussed in the last class?
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - +91 86996 80020: well, AI tools can have a great impact on my studies both positive and negative
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - +91 86996 80020: for instance, it can help me with my homework,research, studying, great ideas
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - +91 86996 80020: in the other hand it can make me lazy as l begin to depend more on it, it can also do my assignments for me and l just copy and paste it, without even reading through or learning anything from it
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - +91 86996 80020: so it will need to be properly used and not abused, and is one of the greatest tools to be ever invented by AI engineers
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! Well, this reminds me how's your academics going? Do you have any challenges or ongoing examinations?
18/10/23, 4:10 pm - +91 86996 80020: I have finished writing maam, 
they were doable , thank you for asking
18/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am sure you will be able to pass your examinations with good scores!💪
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 86996 80020: l did try my best maam, the results will tell
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience with the students through a video really helped. Therefore, I think I should share this with my other students as well.
18/10/23, 4:20 pm - +91 86996 80020: l hear you maam, l shared my story on facebook, which was very convenient for me , and l got quite good responses, 
the issue is preparing the students, as you saw the one l sent their form it took me time to clear their doubts
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - +91 86996 80020: hence , as for me, all l need are the documentations for the process and to prove the authenticity of the program, cause the sharing of my story had a certain impact but is not going to have that impact l desire unless l have the documentations
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Nyasha! In addition to this crucial information, our team has noted down a few points that can be covered in a video to convey our message effectively.
18/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share those with you :

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
18/10/23, 4:25 pm - +91 86996 80020: Alright

08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Wednesday Wisdom and Saturday activity are back!*_

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Thank you
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as promised in our $300 training session,  I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:

- Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant
15/11/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
15/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 86996 80020: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 86996 80020: Done ma'am,
We can proceed
15/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
15/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 86996 80020: Social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and ticktok
15/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 86996 80020: But l strongly feel that WhatsApp would be the main tool here
15/11/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
15/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 86996 80020: Noted ma'am
15/11/23, 3:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
15/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 86996 80020: That makes it easier for  the applicant 
Understood
15/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification. 

Kindly read that!
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 86996 80020: Done ma'am
15/11/23, 3:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, did you notice the questions?
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - +91 86996 80020: Yes ma'am, l did
15/11/23, 3:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
15/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 86996 80020: Understood
15/11/23, 3:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.

15/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?

Will be sure to contact you, if l encounter any challenges
15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am concluding today's session here.I am sharing your Wednesday lesson, which features an incredibly inspiring story of Alex. I would appreciate it if you could share your views on Alex's journey with me by tomorrow positively.
15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

We can begin
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $300 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 86996 80020: Yes ma'am, l recall
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 86996 80020: Attending the sessions diligently
75% attendance at school
Performing well in my earn while you learn 
Those are what l can recall for now
28/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

28/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 4:02 pm - +91 86996 80020: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.

28/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
28/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 4:11 pm - +91 86996 80020: How is that so,
Care to explain to me ma'am

A serving of holiday cheer is here, as we have decided to disperse your sessions for the next two weeks!

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us. The cherry on the cake was that you even won the grant challenge!🏆

Moreover, see how diligently your parents have supported you, and now you've come this far. Now is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this new year, provide them with a sense of financial relief, as you still have a chance to earn way more than what you have got. Go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. What do you think? What are your plans now?🕕
