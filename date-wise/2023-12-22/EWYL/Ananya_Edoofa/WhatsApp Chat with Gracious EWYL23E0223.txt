So, if not done, go and say "I am a proud Edoofian" on your Line. It's not just a phrase; it's a symbol of your commitment to your education and our collective journey.

I'm also curious to learn about your cultural festivals. Why don't you add something about your cultural festival?
27/10/23, 4:30 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Alright i will check if i have some videos..
31/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Parents!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Gracious and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
08/11/23, 5:08 am - +27 84 620 1892: Thank you good morning..
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

02/12/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning @27846201892 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.

13/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Good morning ma'am
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
13/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Yes ma'am it is clear
13/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
13/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okayy
13/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I have understood on the emerging skills that help enhance one's abilities inorder to survive in the future 
I have also managed to understand on the projects offered by Edoofa and the first one being the corporate alliances in which one is supposed to reach out to local organizations in their country arrange a meeting with Edoofa facilitating the signing of a contract 
The second one is community building in which one has to look for youths who have recently finished their high school or who finished within the last six months and refer them to the Edoofa program 
The last one being African Schools Education Reform Mission in which one is required to reach out to local schools and speak to them to collaborate with Edoofa 
And all these projects will help one earn scholarship credits and lower their expenses if correctly done
13/12/23, 4:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, kindly excuse me for not being able to move forward with our discussion. I have been facing some technical challenges today!

However, don't worry; everything will be resolved by tomorrow, and we will move ahead. See you tomorrow! 🌟
13/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Ohh it's okay

14/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Gracious!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?
14/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I would be Vin Diesel and drive as many cars as possible😅
14/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 977 9846: And most probably travel the world
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, that's amazing! Now, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
14/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I am done
14/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
14/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 977 9846: There was summarization on   the first project which is corporate alliances and how one can look for potential companies on LinkedIn 
I also understood on how the projects are able to help me in the future
14/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
14/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I have understood that when looking for a company there are factors to be considered like nature of the company 
It should be student centric ,   recreational or content centric 
The scale and financial stability of the company is also to be considered and there are certain platforms to be used 
And stages on how to carry out the project were given
14/12/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Gracious, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
14/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Thank you😁
14/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
14/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*

14/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Understood
14/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Gracious, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Gracious!
14/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 977 9846: The audio is more of a summary on the second project which is community building and there are instructions on how the project is to be carried out 
It states that l am to look for students who have recently completed their high school and are willing to study abroad
And there are also instructions on how the process of applying is carried out
14/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude today's session, let's recharge for tomorrow's journey. We'll connect again at 1:30 PM with enthusiasm and dedication.

14/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay thank you
See you tomorrow
15/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Gracious!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Good afternoon ma'am 

Wow l really didn't know that 😅
18/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, gracious!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to have a great session today; however, you did not attend your session. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - +27 84 620 1892: Good afternoon Gracious is facing network problems..
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can I know the time I can connect with Gracious?

18/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Wow l really didn't know all that😅
18/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Is it stable now?
18/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Yes l think so
18/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time so that we can proceed with our EWYL projects and earn credits!🌟🎄
18/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay ma'am
19/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Good afternoon ma'am
19/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Gracious! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Wow that's fascinating

19/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
19/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Understood
19/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
19/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay ma'am
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
19/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

19/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Following
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

20/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 977 9846: 😅l don't even know where to start
During the Christmas holiday for me the best part is always about the food and we usually have grilled pork and chicken with seasoning spices
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, that's great!
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, may I ask if you were able to listen to the audio I shared with you yesterday?
20/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Yes l did
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.

20/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
20/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Q1. St David's Girls High Bonda and it is not connected l think
Q3. Manicaland
20/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 977 9846: I am not sure of the second question
20/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
20/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay understood
20/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact?
20/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 977 9846: No l don't but l can look for them and l am sure that I'll have them by tomorrow
20/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
20/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay ma'am
20/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Gracious we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
20/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay 
So far l have understood everything
20/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
20/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 977 9846: +263 77 258 8258
20/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Understood

+263 77 188 3803
20/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
20/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
20/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

20/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
20/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Okay ma'am
20/12/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
20/12/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

21/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Gracious!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places – or should I say, the North Pole!" 🎅✨
21/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 977 9846: Good afternoon ma'am

21/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me Gracious! I got a little confused!😄
21/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 977 9846: It's okay😅
