12/12/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 9:15 am - +260 764283100: Yaayyyyy!!
12/12/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
12/12/23, 9:19 am - +260 764283100: Sure.
12/12/23, 9:24 am - +260 764283100: I’m 17 years old and I’m an only child to a single mother. I live with my grandparents and my mother as well. Currently I’m in Lusaka visiting my cousin. I play soccer from time to time but I do love to dance although I am shy. My goals are to be a God fearing parent one and to be a successful lady in all my endeavors. I have a goal to support my family especially those that have helped raise me. I am passionate about my dreams and I surely do want to become successful. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 9:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Your goals are super inspiring. Being a God-fearing parent and a successful lady is a fantastic combo. It's clear you've got a big heart, wanting to support the family that's been there for you. Keep that passion burning, and success will follow.

Rooting for you all the way! 💪
12/12/23, 9:40 am - +260 764283100: Thank you so much!😊
12/12/23, 9:42 am - +260 764283100: You’re very pretty!🤩
12/12/23, 9:42 am - +260 764283100: Your passions are as well inspiring.
13/12/23, 8:44 am - +260 764283100: Morning Ananya!
13/12/23, 8:49 am - +260 764283100: Are we having a session today?
13/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Natasha!

Kindly excuse me for the slight delay; we were having a team discussion with the admissions team to understand the admissions status of our students. How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 8:50 am - +260 764283100: I’m okay thanks. How are you?
13/12/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing good!
13/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 764283100: Lovely!😊
13/12/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can _actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!
_Link of the group_: https://chat.whatsapp.com/In3er0ZC4e66P2I2lUVq8t
13/12/23, 8:56 am - +260 764283100: Although they are both at work.
13/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 764283100: So they maybe a slight delay.
13/12/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/12/23, 8:59 am - +260 764283100: No I don’t.
13/12/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
13/12/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
13/12/23, 9:03 am - +260 764283100: Oh okay I get it.

13/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Natasha, I couldn't help but notice that your surname is similar to some in India. If you don't mind me asking, do you have any Indian roots or connections?
13/12/23, 9:07 am - +260 764283100: Yes I actually do!
13/12/23, 9:08 am - +260 764283100: My father is Indian. Although I have never met him.
13/12/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's very unfortunate, Natasha! I am sorry to hear that. So, do you live with your mom? <This message was edited>
13/12/23, 9:11 am - +260 764283100: Yes I do. And my grandparents as well. From my mother side that is.
13/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I am sure you must be very close to your mom and grandparents! 🥹
13/12/23, 9:13 am - +260 764283100: 😂😂😂yes I am. Well sometimes.
13/12/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
13/12/23, 9:18 am - +260 764283100: Oh okay!
13/12/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
13/12/23, 9:19 am - +260 764283100: I’m glad they’ll be joining us.
13/12/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
13/12/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 9:21 am - +260 764283100: Definitely!

13/12/23, 9:32 am - +260 764283100: I’m done!✅
13/12/23, 9:34 am - +260 764283100: Although I did come across two questions.
13/12/23, 9:34 am - +260 764283100: 1.How can you put the art of satisfying into practice, and what’s are some scenarios in which you might want to do so. 
2.Why do we find it so hard to filter out distractions.
13/12/23, 9:34 am - +260 764283100: Am I supposed to answer those?
13/12/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let us conclude today's session with a light joke!

Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts! 😄
13/12/23, 9:36 am - +260 764283100: Huh!😭😭😭🤣
13/12/23, 9:36 am - +260 764283100: No ananya😂😂

14/12/23, 8:30 am - +260 764283100: Morning @918800325457 !!
14/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Natasha!

Let us begin today's session with an interesting question: _If you were allowed to spend a day in the life of a fictional character from any book or movie, who would it be and what adventures would you embark on?_
14/12/23, 8:34 am - +260 764283100: Hmm 🤔 I think I’d like to be Tarzan!!! Tarzan as we all know is a strong character. I’d like to travel the world and help out those in need.
14/12/23, 8:34 am - +260 764283100: How are you?
14/12/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing good.
14/12/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's a fantastic choice! Tarzan's adventurous spirit and strength make for an exciting experience.
14/12/23, 8:37 am - +260 764283100: Good to hear.
14/12/23, 8:38 am - +260 764283100: Who would you like to be?
14/12/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: If I were to step into the shoes of an inspirational Hollywood character for a day, I'd choose Forrest Gump from the movie "Forrest Gump." I would embark on a journey of simplicity, kindness, and unexpected adventures. From running across the country to creating a successful shrimping business, I would embrace the opportunities that come my way with an open heart and a positive outlook, spreading joy and inspiring others through my genuine and straightforward approach to life.
14/12/23, 8:41 am - +260 764283100: 🤩!
14/12/23, 8:41 am - +260 764283100: Sounds like so much fun!
14/12/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
14/12/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 8:46 am - +260 764283100: Yes ma’am.
14/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
14/12/23, 8:47 am - +260 764283100: Okay let me go through it.
14/12/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Are you done, Natasha?
14/12/23, 9:07 am - +260 764283100: Almost.
14/12/23, 9:11 am - +260 764283100: @918800325457 I’m done. ✅
14/12/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
14/12/23, 9:29 am - +260 764283100: So the earn while you learn program provides high education which is affordable, accessible and makes you employable. I’ve read that despite the COVID-19 pandemic people rather organizations used different skills to draw in their profits aside from the rapid drawbacks they faced. We as edoofans have to reach to people, we can either use the LinkedIn or our family members, friends or relatives. After outlining the organizations and its managers, we must send them a link to which they can connect with our managers. They has been an emphasis that every time the professionals are facing a problem we must tell them that the matter will be addressed to our managers. Apart from receiving benefits I will as well receive credits. I must make a secondary schools in my area and my school should be the first. I should bear in mind that this only applies to senior secondary schools.
14/12/23, 9:30 am - +260 764283100: We are a team and we must work together.
14/12/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: As we conclude today's session, let's recharge for tomorrow's journey. We'll connect again at 8:30 AM with enthusiasm and dedication. Remember: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.' - Winston Churchill. Looking forward to our continued progress!
14/12/23, 9:31 am - +260 764283100: This is my understanding. 🤷🏽‍♀️
14/12/23, 9:32 am - +260 764283100: 👍🏽 okay!
14/12/23, 9:32 am - +260 764283100: Have a lovely @918800325457
15/12/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Natasha!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!

_Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!_🍓🫐
15/12/23, 8:29 am - +260 764283100: Morning Ananya! Thank you for the fun fact!
15/12/23, 8:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, Natasha, did you manage to read the document I shared with you yesterday?
15/12/23, 8:31 am - +260 764283100: Yes ma’am I did.
15/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
15/12/23, 8:32 am - +260 764283100: We are a team and we must work together.

15/12/23, 8:46 am - +260 764283100: @918800325457 are you still there.
15/12/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, I was going through with your submission, and it is really good. You have summarized it so well.🌟
15/12/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
15/12/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 8:50 am - +260 764283100: For sure I will.
15/12/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
15/12/23, 8:51 am - +260 764283100: Sure.
15/12/23, 8:52 am - +260 764283100: I am unable to download this audio
15/12/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Can I know why?
15/12/23, 8:59 am - +260 764283100: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: I think there are some network challenegs, Natasha!
15/12/23, 9:01 am - +260 764283100: Could you try sending it again?
15/12/23, 9:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:03 am - +260 764283100: Still nothing.
15/12/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:03 am - +260 764283100: Better!!!!
15/12/23, 9:04 am - +260 764283100: Thank you.
15/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
15/12/23, 9:05 am - +260 764283100: Okay.
15/12/23, 9:12 am - +260 764283100: So I have to talk to all my family and friends about how edoofa is helping me and the great opportunities it offers. I have to create a LinkedIn account, LinkedIn is a business platform where I can look for companies as well as the employees working for these companies and connect with them. I can download the LinkedIn app on play store and you’ll help me make an account. I will have to talk to different managers through the LinkedIn platform and I must make sure to get their contact numbers to set up a meeting with the edoofa managers for further information. I will have to hereby inform you.
15/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
15/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/12/23, 9:15 am - +260 764283100: Okay.
15/12/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
15/12/23, 9:24 am - +260 764283100: When looking for the right type of companies they are 4 factors to consider. These are : nature of the company, scale of the company, financial stability and the background of the company. These are the major criteria when in search for the companies aside from the steps that must be followed. The steps help you find the right companies in an efficient and systematic way.
15/12/23, 9:24 am - +260 764283100: That’s my understanding
15/12/23, 9:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
15/12/23, 9:28 am - +260 764283100: Thank you🥰
15/12/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday.🌟
15/12/23, 9:38 am - +260 764283100: For sure.
15/12/23, 9:38 am - +260 764283100: Have a great day!
18/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week,Natasha!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨

18/12/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: It was amazing, Natasha! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

18/12/23, 8:50 am - +260 764283100: Got it ✅
18/12/23, 8:51 am - +260 764283100: When do I have to start?
18/12/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
18/12/23, 8:56 am - +260 764283100: If I’m not mistaken project 2 is about persuasive skills and project 3 is about higher secondary school education (listing schools in my region and making sure my school is the first) yes?
18/12/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, and we will learn more about it.
18/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 764283100: Okay!👍🏽
18/12/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Natasha, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Natasha!
18/12/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 9:02 am - +260 764283100: ✅
18/12/23, 9:02 am - +260 764283100: So Ananya you’re going to give me posters?
18/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Natasha! Before that, can you  you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
18/12/23, 9:16 am - +260 764283100: In this project I’ll be approaching my own friends and classmates who are willing to study abroad and have all completed their high school or have just written their exams. I can start off by telling them about my journey with edoofa and what edoofa has done for me till now. Like for instance the good career concealing you’ve offered and the ewyl program. These people have to be serious about study abroad. I can only share their details with you once their parents have approved of it. Aside from offering them the posters you will also share with me an offline application for them to fill in. Once the form is filled in by the particular person I must post the filled in application in the group. With this said I’m only allowed to share 10 applications per week.
18/12/23, 9:16 am - +260 764283100: This is my understanding.
18/12/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: That’s awesome, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
18/12/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

19/12/23, 8:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Natasha! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨

Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Natasha, I was hoping to have a fruitful session today with some new targets. However, you did not attend the session. May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
20/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Natasha! 🎄

To kick off our session with a festive spirit, how about starting with a Christmas-themed icebreaker? I invite you to share something related to the holiday season that holds special meaning for you. It could be a favorite ornament, a cherished holiday recipe, or even a funny holiday-themed anecdote. ✨🧑🏽‍🎄🎄
20/12/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Natasha, since you never miss your sessions, I am worried about you not attending the last two sessions. Is everything alright? If you are facing any challenges, kindly let me know.
21/12/23, 5:21 am - +260 97 5963257: Greetings to you ALL, on behalf of Natasha and my family we wish first of all to thank you for according her the chance to secure a scholarship through your organisation.  However, due to circumstances beyond our control as a family we have decided to withdraw from this programme.  We regret any incomvenience caused in this regard.  Thank you.
21/12/23, 8:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @260975963257 

I hope you are doing well. I understand that your family is facing some challenges. However, if you don't mind, I need to understand what really happened. As Natasha's mentor, it is crucial for me to grasp the concerns and problems you have been facing while progressing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
21/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 97 5963257: We are appreciate your concerns.  Kindly note that Natasha has decided to pull out of this programme due to financial and circumstances beyond our control.  At this stage, we wish to request you to accept our decision because this is the only reason we can give.  Thank you.
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand where you're coming from, and I genuinely appreciate you sharing your concerns with us. However, can I know if you are concerned with this post over the Internet?
21/12/23, 2:16 pm - +260 97 5963257: Not concerned with this post, you may consider my submission as reason for withdraw.
21/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have mentioned that you are facing some financial challenges, have you discussed this with the admissions team?
21/12/23, 2:20 pm - +260 97 5963257: Yes madam with was already discussed and our decision is final.
21/12/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, that's alright; your decision is final, and trust me, no one is forcing you. Being Natasha's mentor, I am just concerned about her future education. I want to understand what her plans are for higher education.
