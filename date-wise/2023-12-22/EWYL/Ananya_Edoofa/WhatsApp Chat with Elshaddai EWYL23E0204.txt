23/08/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 956 1557: thank you sir
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 956 1557: yes sir I  do
23/08/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, tell me then!
23/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 956 1557: Help the student  get enrolled in  a good  educational  facility and be able achieve  his dreams ...right
23/08/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 956 1557: Noted and understood thank you for the enlightenment.
23/08/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 956 1557: I have read the same
23/08/23, 9:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/08/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 956 1557: Thank you guys for embarking on this journey with me... It's good to know  that l have support from the professionals

24/08/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask why are you late today? Are you facing any challenges?

24/08/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
24/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 956 1557: This message was deleted
24/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
24/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian.

15/09/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Elshaddai

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm*

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on:
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

18/09/23, 8:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263789561557 @263772483564 

I was expecting a response from your end. May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
19/09/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, may I ask if you were able to decide?
19/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 248 3564: Today lovely will update u after my meeting at work
19/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 248 3564: Will be able to see my timetable

21/09/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 248 3564: Yes
21/09/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I believe you must have gone through the document, right?
21/09/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 248 3564: No I hadn't  m sure the student had worked on t before he left
21/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, so Elshaddai must have read it.
21/09/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/09/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
21/09/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 248 3564: Ok
21/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, may I ask when Elshaddai will be available?
21/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 248 3564: He will be back after his exams in November
21/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was occupied with my sessions. <This message was edited>
08/12/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning,Elshaddai!

Due to some personal reasons, I won't be able to connect for our session today. However, I had a plan for our session, which I am stating now.

With years of experience, I want you to accumulate some credits before you come here to India. Students who have already earned some credits are living much better lives as they can help their parents with travel costs and even semester fees. I am sure you have also signed up for EWYL, so that you can do the same. As your mentor, I want to ensure that you utilize our services and earn for yourself. Now, have some faith in me and start working.

As a starting point, I have a small target for you for the day! Connect with at least *2 students* today under your community building project and submit the application forms to me by tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will either be successful with the two students or may face some challenges, on which we will work together!

All the best!
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 956 1557: Morning
08/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 956 1557: Ok fine

 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
14/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 956 1557: This is wonderful
14/12/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
14/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
14/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/12/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

14/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 956 1557: Let me do as so
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
14/12/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

14/12/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

15/12/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!

_Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!_🍓🫐
15/12/23, 8:30 am - +263 78 956 1557: Amazing 😍
15/12/23, 8:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, Natasha, did you manage to listen to the audio I shared with you yesterday?

15/12/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 956 1557: Alright so basically.... the fourth project main aim is that the edoofian manages to get in touch and introduce the edoofa to local secondary schools and starting with their iwn and later asking the headmaster if maybe he can help with connecting the other principals with the board director of the program.
15/12/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
15/12/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 956 1557: Yes ...do l have like a specific space of time to do all these.
15/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: No, Elshaddai. See, you are working for your own credits, the more time you can invest the more credits you will be able to earn.
15/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 956 1557: Thank you.... for clearing that one out.

and reliable and has already made standard history the past years and was wondering if you could connect with it's director to get a better understanding and maybe introduce it at your school.

Hwedza is the name of the province
15/12/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, as per our records, your school is already partnered with us. I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well. <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 956 1557: Alright let's get to it.
15/12/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
15/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 956 1557: No ..l don't have any headmasters Whatapp contact but l do as suggested and look for them.
15/12/23, 9:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday.

Meanwhile, I'd like to give you a small target as a fresher: try connecting with 4-to 5 students under your community-building project and submit their application forms. As it's your first time, this will help you understand the process and potential challenges. Feel free to share any difficulties you encounter so that we can address them together when we reconvene on Monday.
18/12/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: 🎶 Welcome to the festive spirit of Christmas week, Elshaddai!

Did you know that Santa's reindeer are not just fast fliers; they also have some fun names! Can you name all eight of them? There's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. And of course, the most famous reindeer of all, Rudolph, with his shiny red nose! 🦌🎅✨
18/12/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I was hoping to have a great session today; however, you did not attend your session. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
18/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 248 3564: Good morning I am.also checking with him as I am.not home .There should be having power issues .
19/12/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good  morning, @263772483564 

How are you doing? Can I know if he is available to connect now?
20/12/23, 1:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263789561557 @263772483564 

I hope you are doing well. I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?

Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.

As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?
20/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 248 3564: Good
20/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 248 3564: Good morning our mentor ..I am currently out of thr country I called elshaddai and he was saying there were having power issues and it's been difficult to access him their transforma is dead
20/12/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, @263772483564. However, can I know how we are going to manage our sessions then?
21/12/23, 8:24 am - +263 78 956 1557: Hello
21/12/23, 8:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Elshaddai!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places – or should I say, the North Pole!" 🎅✨
21/12/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 956 1557: 😂😂.. Good morning.

21/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 956 1557: Cause l have this friend of mine  who did

21/12/23, 9:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, you can!

21/12/23, 10:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Elshaddai
21/12/23, 10:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: We have to conclude our session for today. I wish we could have proceeded for a longer time, but that's alright as we will connect again tomorrow!
