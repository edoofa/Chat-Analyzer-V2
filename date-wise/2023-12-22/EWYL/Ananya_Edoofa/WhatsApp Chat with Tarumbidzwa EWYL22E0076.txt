Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 12:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!




Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌


_Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._



Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.


The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc.


Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 5:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2023*
25/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Noted, thank you
27/11/23, 10:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Parents, and Tarumbidzwa!

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

Time: 6:00 PM
27/11/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 284 4644: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 284 4644: The spirit of competition refers to the positive and sportsmanlike attitude individuals adopt when engaging in competitive activities.
 It involves fair play, respect for opponents, and a commitment to giving one's best effort. This mindset emphasizes the pursuit of excellence, improvement, and learning from challenges, rather than focusing solely on winning.


The spirit of competition embodies the drive for improvement, learning, and achievement.
 It encourages individuals to push their limits, fostering growth and innovation. While competition can be intense, the focus is on bettering oneself and others, rather than simply winning at all costs. It thrives on fair play, respect, and the pursuit of excellence.



The spirit of competition  positively influenced  my approach to challenges by fostering a growth mindset. 
Instead of seeing challenges as obstacles, I can now see  the spirit of competition  them as opportunities for improvement and learning. This mindset encourages resilience, determination, and a willingness to push my limits.
 The focus shifts from just winning to personal and collective development, creating a more constructive and adaptive approach to facing challenges.

I used to do my academics alone, never cared about others having better marks than me
But later, I had to compete with them
And with the spirit of competition, I became a better person academically
27/11/23, 11:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good job! Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!
27/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Good evening ma'am
27/11/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good Evening, Tarumbidzwa!

This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Very curious
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $100 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Yes I do
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Yes
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 284 4644: OK, I remember
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 284 4644: OK I understand
27/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 284 4644: OK noted
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 284 4644: I understand
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 284 4644: I am aware
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

09/12/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 284 4644: 😀I am a cloud
09/12/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Tarumbidzwa?
09/12/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 284 4644: I was busy with engineering drawing, I have end term exam on Monday
09/12/23, 4:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Woow, that's wonderful 😀
You can continue with the story
09/12/23, 4:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Not good at guessing 😂but sounds interesting
09/12/23, 4:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
09/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 284 4644: That's nice! He did a good job
09/12/23, 5:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
09/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 284 4644: For sure, I can
09/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, as we are finishing today's session, I want you to update your LinkedIn profile and share the link with me this week so that I can help you with it.

You can refer to this video!

⭕Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). 

Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,
Team EWYL

14/12/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening,Tarumbidzwa!

As promised, I am sharing your progress report for November!
14/12/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action tomorrow for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
14/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 228 1356: Good evening, as a parent may I be appraised if there's a way to consider the student lectures Time Table that the Attendance, Webinars and Orientation be tabled not to coincide with the lectures. Otherwise,  the noble idea of Grant may be slippery to students since lectures are mandatory. This is a result of the Progress report posted above. I also have been following concerns from Tarumbidzwa requesting for rescheduling of them since she either had lectures or Exams. Surely,  as an underprivileged student,  I thought she could benefit from the Grant which has become elusive, though I am not privy to the percentage of students who have so far benefited from the Grants or EWYL
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 284 4644: OK thank you
14/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 78 284 4644: How do you record the attendance?



Which 3 did I miss  again?
Besides that one I told you I was sick and you said I should sleep
14/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 284 4644: And may you please tell me, the webnar I missed
14/12/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Mr. Masomere.

Firstly, I would like to kindly excuse myself for not being able to connect with you earlier. I was occupied with the students' grants and the upcoming industrial visit, specially organized for our students.

I understand your concerns, and I would like to assure you that Tarumbidzwa is progressing in the right direction in terms of her performance. I see that you have expressed concerns about our schedule. However, as an educational institute, we always consider the fact that our sessions do not collide with our students' classes. The Department of Student Welfare consistently informs us about our students' timings, and the last class in her college is scheduled for 5:00 PM.

As you can see, you only connect once a week, and that too later in the evening. We understand the importance of our students attending classes and maintaining a balanced lifestyle. Additionally, many of my students from the same university attend the calls on time, and as I have mentioned, so does Tarumbidzwa, except for a few days she has mentioned.

Regarding the grant, the main reason she is not eligible is her absence from the orientation program, which I have cross-verified in our attendance sheet; she was not present.
14/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 284 4644: 1. I totally don't know why you always record that    I missed some sessions

Last time you said you will check, but you didn't send feedback later


For the session I only know 1 only..
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The sessions and webinars are something that can be covered in December. I am happy to say that she is even closer to that goal!
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Which orientation exactly
The 1st one or the current one




As much as I know, I was present on the day
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 284 4644: But why is it that every record sheet, you record that I missed some sessions
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The total sessions are recorded from September to November; that's why they are presented as a whole, Tarumbidzwa! Kindly understand, if you mention being sick during the examination to your school teacher, that doesn't mean you will be awarded attendance credit.
14/12/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: If you want, I can share the attendance sheet, Tarumbidzwa!
14/12/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 284 4644: Then it should be 1 session missed, not 3
14/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 284 4644: 3. For the sheets I will make a plan, but how can we encourage them to come really
What can we tell them, because personally the grant thing I now believe it's not really legit
. What if those people come here believing that they will work for the grant and cover some school  fees.. And then they become like me...
Every time they is a record of missed sessions
 Not every family back there is financially stable, what will they do then.. They will be found not eligible
And then they won't be able to pay the school fees and then what



I believe I can encourage more if I see it working on me or Atleast to some of my streammates, at least I can have confidence it's true
I don't want any of the students to face the same problem as mine, because some may not be able to have money to cover school fees and some expenses here
14/12/23, 4:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 284 4644: So firstly I think, if it works on me first or Atleast to some friends of mine, I will surely encourage them to come

As of now, I don't have an guarantee that it's true, I don't want others to stress their parents with school fees just like what's happening now


Because firstly when the grant was introduced, you just told us to do some tasks and EWYL to earn the grant only 


And then after, in the grant letter then came other conditions that we should do some tasks again and attend webnars

After we attended other conditions came again even to those who were found eligible
More tasks and webnars are to be done again... Seems the grant thing continues over and over
Conditions after conditions




Right now due date for fees payment for next semester is 31 Dec and we are still struggling for the grant and it may also extend to January
And obvsly our parents are going to pay the full amount before the due date
14/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 228 1356: Maybe grant restrictions are to limit grant beneficiaries such that just a few Maybe benefit
15/12/23, 3:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tarumbidzwa!

Are you ready to connect with me?
15/12/23, 4:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Reminder for Tarumbidzwa: Tomorrow's call_*

18/12/23, 12:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Tarumbidzwa, Exciting Update Alert: 13 Days to Go!* 🚀

Let me spill some tea – one of our rockstar students flipped his eligibility from "not eligible" to "grant-ready" last month! How, you ask? By showing up to every call, putting in his 100% on projects, and making it happen. 🌟

18/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 284 4644: In a quaint town named Jalandar , there lived a young artisan named Tarumbidzwa . Known for her exceptional skills in crafting intricate jewellery, Tarumbidzwa's creations were highly sought after. One day, a mysterious stranger approached her with an offer to mass-produce her designs and make a fortune.

Tarumbidzwa , guided by her unwavering integrity, declined the tempting proposal. Instead, she chose to continue her diligent work, putting her heart and soul into each piece. Word of her commitment to quality and authenticity spread, attracting customers who valued the true artistry behind her jewellery.

As time passed, Tarumbidzwa 's small shop flourished, and she became a respected figure in Jalandhar 
. Her success was not only a testament to her artistic talent but also to the enduring virtues of integrity and diligence. The town thrived on the principles that echoed in Tarumbidzwa's creations, reminding everyone that true value is found in the sincerity and hard work invested in every endeavor.
19/12/23, 8:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tarumbidzwa!

 I appreciate the inspiring tale of integrity and diligence. It's heartening to see how her commitment to quality and authenticity not only contributed to the success of her small shop but also became a guiding light for the entire town. Tarumbidzwa's story is a beautiful reminder that true value lies in the sincerity and hard work invested in every endeavor. Thank you for sharing this uplifting narrative!
19/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 284 4644: Good morning ma'am
