Thank you
14/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
14/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 756 5183: Thank you madam. I must say I am greatly inspired and even more excited to be working with you Ms Ananya!!
14/12/23, 10:29 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Wilma! Now, get ready with your introduction as we are going to connect tomorrow at 1:30 pm, and I am so excited to learn more about you!🌟
14/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 756 5183: The feeling is mutual🫱🏾‍🫲🏾Have a good day.
15/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Wilma!

I hope you are doing well, let us begin today's session with an amazing fact!
Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't. In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries. So, the next time you enjoy a banana, you can think of it as a true berry!🍓🫐
15/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 756 5183: 😂🫱🏾‍🫲🏾 Good afternoon madam

Thank you for the amazing fact. I will keep that in mind considering that bananas are my favorite fruits!
15/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Lovely!Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
15/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Of course

I am seventeen years old and I learn at ZRP High School, which is a well reputable school in Zimbabwe.Unlike most girls I am very tenacious and ambitious. I'm quite charismatic, confident and hardworking. My strength mainly lies in debate and public speaking thus I can say I am a lawyer in the making. Apart from that, my main goal is to be powerful and influential.
I am passionate about sports irregardless of the fact that I am passive, I still love to watch a good game. As well I am keen about gymnastics since I am a gymnast myself and very much into singing as that I can do as well

Thank you
15/12/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Being a future lawyer, huh? Debate and public speaking must be your superpowers. 💬💪 And aiming for power and influence – that's the spirit! Keep aiming high!

Sports fan, even if you're more on the passive side? That's amazing. What's your favorite sport to watch? And gymnastics! Wow, being a gymnast yourself is brilliant. Do you have a favorite move or routine?

And singing too? That's a diverse set of talents! What kind of music do you enjoy belting out? Keep rocking those ambitions! 🚀✨ <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Yes I find arguing for the right reasons and otherwise, quite intriguing! I like to think of it as a battle of mental supremacy😂

Yes when it comes to soccer mainly I am big supporter on Manchester City, it is unfortunate however that running is not  my strength 💔
When it comes to gymnastics I enjoy splits, they offer some sort of relaxation. 

In terms of music I listen to anything that is good to the ears 😂🫱🏾‍🫲🏾 I'm not very specific on genre.I appreciate that the art of music accommodates diversity. <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It's great to hear about your interests and preferences!🌟
15/12/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 756 5183: No madam
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
15/12/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
15/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK, thank you madam
15/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
15/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Thank you Ms Ananya for acquainting me with everyone else.
15/12/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
15/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Yes, definitely exciting
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

15/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude our session today. Since we don't have sessions on Saturdays and Sundays, let's plan to reconnect on Monday!🌟
15/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK madam. _Have a great weekend!!_
18/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Good day Madam
18/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Wilma?
18/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 756 5183: That sound terrific Madame.... Thank you so much

18/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I understood that the program enhances both personal growth and communal growth. Individually, I will be benefitting financially, socially as well as gaining technical experience.
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I will also be reaching out to influencial people inoder to make connections with them as well as marketing Edoofa.
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
18/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Ok

18/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I'm being encouraged to start my LinkedIn account and to interact with business officials. The audio is also appealing to my social reserve as well, I am being encouraged to be firmiliar with relatives as well as neighbors for advertisement, but above all Im being trained for skills I will apply after university. <This message was edited>
18/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks, Wilma I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
18/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session time is over, let's connect tomorrow at the same time so that we can proceed with our EWYL projects and earn credits!🌟🎄
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 756 5183: The guide talks about how one can find suitable companies and how it is important to make a background check on the founder of the company. It also highlights the key words when searching for a company and encourages the edoofian to interact with managers of various departments before the founder
18/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK madam good day
19/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Good day madam
19/12/23, 1:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Wilma! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Honestly, I want to enquire on the companies I can consult. Would it be ok if I reached out to all profitable companies with promising  social cooperate services? <This message was edited>

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
19/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Alright thank you

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
20/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 756 5183: 1. ZRP High School, I don't know but I don't think so

2.Good day Head of ____High School. My name is Wilma Danai Bvekwa, a participant of the Edoofa scholarship program and I am proposing a great deal for you that will benefit your school leavers with scholarships and chances of better tertiary education.I hope you are interested <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Well, as per our records, your school is not connected with us. And Voila! You can therefore connect with your own school and earn credits at an initial stage!
20/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Harare Metropolitan Province
20/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK madam
20/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
20/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Yes I have the number of the head
20/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
20/12/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
20/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK madam
20/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

21/12/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Wilma!

Let us begin our session with a thought! Have you ever wondered why Santa doesn't get a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? It turns out he has 'Sleigh Parking Only' privileges and his reindeer are excellent at navigating the skies without worrying about traffic laws. It seems Santa's got connections in high places – or should I say, the North Pole!" 🎅✨
21/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 756 5183: 😂

Good afternoon
21/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: How are you,, Wilma?
21/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I'm very well ma'am.
How are you doing yourself ?!
21/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if you were able to connect with the school head?
21/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 756 5183: I sent the message but he hasn't yet responded.I will continue to make a follow up. <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
21/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 756 5183: As of now am I only doing project 3 or I can do one and two.
21/12/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Definitely you can do all these projects, simultaneously!
21/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Alright madam
21/12/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now,since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
21/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Noted madam
21/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday : 9:30 a.m to 11:00 a.m
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
21/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 756 5183: OK madam
21/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: May I aks if you have dropped the message on the Line? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 756 5183: Yes I have
21/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, great! <This message was edited>
