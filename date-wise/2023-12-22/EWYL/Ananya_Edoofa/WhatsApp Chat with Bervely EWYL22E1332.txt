03/10/23, 8:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
04/10/23, 3:31 am - +91 84482 43530: Good morning ma'am
04/10/23, 3:31 am - +91 84482 43530: I already submitted the reviews on Facebook
04/10/23, 3:31 am - +91 84482 43530: The day l submitted on Google too
04/10/23, 7:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Did you share the screenshots with me?
04/10/23, 7:35 am - +91 84482 43530: Yes l did share it
04/10/23, 7:35 am - +91 84482 43530: Through the earn while you learn line
04/10/23, 11:01 am - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly share them here!
04/10/23, 11:12 am - +91 84482 43530: I have already done that
04/10/23, 11:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: can you please reshare those with me?
05/10/23, 10:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Bervely, may I ask, is it really that difficult to accomplish the necessary tasks? I believe it wouldn't take more than 10 minutes to complete the task. It's quite disheartening when it seems like you're neglecting important tasks and my messages, especially when I'm always striving to do my best for you.
05/10/23, 10:30 am - +91 84482 43530: Ma'am check the earn while you learn line please
05/10/23, 10:32 am - +91 84482 43530: It seems l sender these things there .with all ur respect please stop portraying me as someone who do not do her things on time
05/10/23, 10:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: I asked you to share those here with me, dear!
05/10/23, 10:32 am - +91 84482 43530: And l did didn't l
05/10/23, 10:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: I have not received those here!
05/10/23, 10:34 am - +91 84482 43530: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 10:34 am - +91 84482 43530: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 10:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Can you please share the number through which you have shared these on the Line?
05/10/23, 10:35 am - +91 84482 43530: These are the proof of me sending you these  things so why are you saying these things
05/10/23, 10:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Beverly, please understand that there might be a technical glitch preventing me from receiving your input on the Line. That's why I requested you to share it in the group. If I didn't trust you, I wouldn't have asked you to do so. I'm just trying to ensure your progress, and if I can't receive it there, sharing it here is a backup option. However, it seems you didn't do that.
05/10/23, 10:38 am - +91 84482 43530: We're have l gone wrong now ....You were the one who told me to send things via the earn while you learn line only so what have l done wrong now
05/10/23, 10:39 am - +91 84482 43530: But ma'am l informed you that l share the things via the earn while you learn line if you did not received them via that why didn't you mention it rather you are now portraying me as someone who is not taking her work seriously
05/10/23, 10:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've done it here, I can ask my team to review and check why I didn't receive your input through the EWYL line. My concerns were simply to ensure that you've completed your task, and if I haven't received the input, it's not your fault.
05/10/23, 10:42 am - +91 84482 43530: Please ma'am make sure you fix the earn while you learn line because with the way you are saying  things angers me because my parents think that am not doing my task whilst l am
05/10/23, 10:43 am - +91 84482 43530: Please be organise as a team there for us to cooperate well ... am not happy with this at all as a student
05/10/23, 10:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, dear! That's why I asked you to cooperate and share it here so that I can ensure that my students are doing great. It's a technical glitch! Don't worry!
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday

⏳07:00-07:45 PM

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience through the video really helped. That's why I would also like you to create a video for your community.Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls).

08/11/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
08/11/23, 4:06 pm - +91 84482 43530: Okay ma'am let me do that
08/11/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
08/11/23, 4:14 pm - +91 84482 43530: Okay ma'am so when l open the Facebook and  and find the students l will notify you and you will assist me if that is possible

08/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share such questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 4:27 pm - +91 84482 43530: Okay maam
08/11/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?

08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

08/12/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action *tomorrow* for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that.

09/12/23, 5:00 pm - +91 84482 43530: Yes clouds
09/12/23, 5:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 5:06 pm - +91 84482 43530: Wow that is very nice
09/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
09/12/23, 5:29 pm - +91 84482 43530: Hardwork
09/12/23, 5:29 pm - +91 84482 43530: And commitment
09/12/23, 5:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, now that our session time is over, let us connect for a call next Saturday. Meanwhile, I am sharing your Saturday activity with you.
09/12/23, 5:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Saturday: Let's Practice Microsoft Excel_*

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

*Activity Instructions:*

⭕Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

⭕Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). 

Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

13/12/23, 1:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday!_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝🏽

Best regards,
Team EWYL

13/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Take your time, as we are going to discuss this tomorrow!

Guess what? We're halfway through the marathon, with only 15 days left to crush it in the grant game! 🏁✨

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us!🏆

Moreover, see how diligently your parents have supported you, and now you've come this far. Now is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this new year, provide them with a sense of financial relief, as you still have a chance to earn way more than what you have got. Go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. What do you think? What are your plans now?🕕
