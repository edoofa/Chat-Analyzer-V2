Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity.

09/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 420 6520: Good afternoon Ms Ananya.Alright Ms Ananya.
20/12/23, 1:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,@263774206520 !

I hope you are doing well. I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?

Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.

As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?
20/12/23, 10:46 pm - +263 77 420 6520: Please make another schedule for me Ms Ananya so that I be consistant with the sessions.
21/12/23, 7:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Genius!

21/12/23, 7:56 am - +263 77 420 6520: Good morning Ms Ananya.The first slot is fine
21/12/23, 8:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Genius! So, shall we connect today at 9:30 a.m?
