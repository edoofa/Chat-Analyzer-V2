You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

08/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 95012 69490: Okay ma'am
08/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To begin, as discussed in our previous conversation, I'm certain you've already prepared the questions for the verification process. Would you like to share them with me?
08/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 95012 69490: 1. Have you understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not a fully funded scholarship program? 
2. Have you understood the cost of studying and living in India?
3. Have you understood the Earn While You Learn program, how it works and it's benefits? 
4.How much do you have to pay for your enrollment fee and admission fee if you are found eligible?
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 95012 69490: Okay ma'am following
08/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step *"International Student Admission Eligibility Check"*
08/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 95012 69490: Following
08/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 3:02 pm - +91 95012 69490: Noted
08/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 3:15 pm - +91 95012 69490: I will reach out to students using different way such as face book , parents, whatsapp, teachers.
After reaching out to the students l will then explain the Edoofa Scholarship Program to those who would have responded and also tell them about the Earn While You Learn program.  I will also tell them about the expenses such as the enrolment and admission fee.  And if the student intrested l will ask him or her a few questions and guide him or her where he's wrong . Then l will share the form with my mentor
08/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 3:16 pm - +91 95012 69490: Thank you ma'am

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 95012 69490: Yes ma'am
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 95012 69490: I had to get my attendance by saying 'I'M A PROUD EDOOFIAN '
I also had to submit 10 community building forms every week
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

23/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 


The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 95012 69490: Following
23/11/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.

Are you willing to put in all your efforts for the next 30 days?

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
08/12/23, 3:52 pm - +91 95012 69490: But my friends'  reports are saying the webinars are 6 only mine is saying 8

May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
3. I sincerely think we both are a great team and I want to know the key areas that you have identified for yourself after reflecting on your performance until now, where you need more assistance from my end?

I am delighted to share that one of my students *Shantel Maroza* has successfully surpassed her grant amount of *$200*, and I couldn't be more proud. She has earned *$240* credits in two months. Upon asking her how she could surpass the amount in just a few months, she shared a few tips and tricks with me, and I thought I should share these with you!

✔️She asked her parents to connect with her student's parents to talk about the Edoofa scholarship program.
✔️She highlighted the various opportunities like internships, webinars, and exposure to her students.
✔️She also asked her juniors from the school to add her to the group.

Tell me, what are the steps you are taking to surpass your limited grant amount?
15/12/23, 5:56 pm - +91 95012 69490: Woow that's amazing ma'am

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us. The cherry on the cake was that you even won the grant challenge!🏆

Moreover, see how diligently your parents have supported you, and now you've come this far. Now is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this new year, provide them with a sense of financial relief, as you still have a chance to earn way more than what you have got. Go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. What do you think? What are your plans now?🕕 <This message was edited>
