I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_.

27/09/23, 10:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*
27/09/23, 10:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
27/09/23, 10:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.
27/09/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._
27/09/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.
27/09/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you got this?
27/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 483 8660: Noted
27/09/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Tanyaradzwa can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 483 8660: Sure following closely
27/09/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
27/09/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
27/09/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
27/09/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
27/09/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

01/11/23, 10:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

07/11/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon, _my wonderful Edoofian and parents!_

I hope you're all doing fantastic! I am absolutely thrilled to share the incredible experience of our recent orientation journey at various partner universities. Our orientation event is not just a mere program; it's a grand welcome to an exciting academic adventure. At Edoofa, we ensure that our students are well-prepared for what lies ahead, and we open the doors to a world of exclusive opportunities for them. The response from our amazing students has been nothing short of overwhelming, and I am bursting with pride to be their mentor👏🏼
07/11/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This event was made possible through the partnership of the Earn While You Learn Team and the Department of Student Welfare, whom we discussed last week. Take a look at this remarkable journey, and imagine how you'd like your own orientation program to be. Just picture the excitement of meeting me, your mentor, in person!
*What would your dream orientation program look like?*
_Share your thoughts and let's make it an interactive and lively conversation! 😊_

16/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 73 267 3608: I already did
20/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tanyaradzwa,
I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!
21/11/23, 9:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tanyaradzwa,

21/11/23, 9:45 am - +263 73 267 3608: Yes
21/11/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Tanyaradzwa, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Tanyaradzwa!
21/11/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 9:53 am - +263 73 267 3608: I'm done
21/11/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.

21/11/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Tanyaradzwa, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
21/11/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

22/11/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tanyaradzwa,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
22/11/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great job on submitting the form! I've forwarded it to our dedicated counseling team. Now, let's keep the momentum going by staying in close touch with the students and promptly addressing any questions or concerns they might have. Together, we're making a positive impact! 🌟
22/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 73 267 3608: Yes
22/11/23, 9:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
22/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 73 267 3608: I see
22/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Tanyaradzwa/Saloni/22NOV2023*
22/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
22/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 73 267 3608: Oky understood
22/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 73 267 3608: Aren't 60 quite too many
22/11/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is just an average number, the actual can surely differ.
22/11/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: How many total students are their in the A Level?
22/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 73 267 3608: At my school there were 50 form six students and 40 lower sixes
22/11/23, 9:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, then you can add all of them in the group.
22/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 73 267 3608: It is rather hard to convince others when I myself haven't got the university acceptance to go along with my word
22/11/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well, you will soon get it but I am sure you can share these amazing resources that I am going to share with you to attract their attention.
22/11/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/11/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
22/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
22/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

23/11/23, 9:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any doubts in the second project?
23/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 73 267 3608: Only about the formation of the said group from yesterday
23/11/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, tell me what is your concern in that?
23/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 73 267 3608: I only have 3 students who are interested in the program the rest are adamant on getting proof first before they decide to join in
23/11/23, 9:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why are the other students disinterested in knowing about Edoofa?
23/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 73 267 3608: I couldn't know all their reasons buh as I said before some want proof
23/11/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share some amazing resources with you that will help you attracting more and more people to become a part of this program.

23/11/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
23/11/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:52 am - +263 73 267 3608: So the project aims to set up communication between schools and edoofa officials
23/11/23, 9:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, can you elaborate your understanding a bit?
23/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 73 267 3608: Oky established communication helps to expose other students to the Edoofa program
23/11/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Our session for today is coming to a close, but I'm already looking forward to catching up with you tomorrow from 09:00-10:00 AM in the EWYL Group! 🏆 Get ready for another productive and energizing session. Can't wait to see you there!
23/11/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will discuss this tomorrow for sure!

24/11/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tanyaradzwa!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
24/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 73 267 3608: Oky
24/11/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
24/11/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​

24/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please note that your session will be on:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
24/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
24/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
24/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
24/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
24/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
24/11/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

Once upon a frosty North Pole night, Santa Claus was feeling particularly mischievous. He decided to become a Secret Santa and spread the magic of surprise! With a twinkle in his eye, he selected a list of students from around the world to receive special gifts. 🎁🌍

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
20/12/23, 3:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
