I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read it.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.

How are you?
21/12/23, 11:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would like to inform you that the student you referred - Utsiwegota Nashe   has successfully passed the eligibility test for Edoof and has been granted admission into the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program. Despite this achievement, the student has not yet paid the enrollment fees, but there is a commitment to do so.
21/12/23, 11:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: As their student leader, I kindly request your assistance with the following:
▪️ Inquire about their experience during the entire counseling process and address any challenges they may be facing.
▪️ Share a video or testimony detailing your personal journey with Edoofa, aiming to alleviate any trust concerns they might have. Highlight how Edoofa has positively impacted the lives of over 5000 African students.
▪️ Provide them with videos such as Africa Meet and Greet 2023 and 2022, along with the one featuring the Founders meeting the First Lady of Zimbabwe and Cabinet Ministers of Zambia & Malawi.
