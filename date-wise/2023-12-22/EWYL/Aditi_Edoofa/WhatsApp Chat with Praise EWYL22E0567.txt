I hope you are doing well.

 My name is *Ms. Aditi Kapoor* and I will be taking forward your EWYL journey from now onwards.

I would like to inform you that Ms. Riva will be boarding to pursue her higher education and would have to part ways from us with a heavy heart, but I wanted to make sure that you don't miss out on any learning and earning opportunity.

10/08/23, 4:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!

Hope you are well.

I've noticed that we haven't been in touch for a while, and you've been inactive in our conversations. I wanted to check in and see if you're facing any challenges or if there's anything you'd like to discuss. Your feedback and response are important to me. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Hope you are well.

It's been a while since we last connected. Your insights and contributions are valuable. I'd love to hear from you again and see how you're doing. Please share your thoughts, experiences, or any updates you'd like to share. Let's keep the conversation going! <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you well. I have noticed your continued *lack of attendance in our sessions and no response to my previous messages is a matter of concern* I hope that you know that you are missing out on a lot of opportunities due to your absence. It is imperative that you promptly address this communication gap. Please reply without delay or provide a valid reason for your unresponsiveness.
📍Your immediate attention to this matter is expected.
