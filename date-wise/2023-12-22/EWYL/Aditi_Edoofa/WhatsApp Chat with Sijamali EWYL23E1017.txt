Here's a festive riddle to spark curiosity: *What do you get if you cross a snowman and a vampire?*

Excited to reveal the answer and dive into our discussion!
19/12/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 6058891: We may begin our session
19/12/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Do you know the answer of the riddle?
19/12/23, 8:52 am - +260 97 6058891: I don't know 😅
19/12/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, the answer is a frostbite🥶
19/12/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
19/12/23, 8:55 am - +260 97 6058891: 😅🤣🤣

19/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
19/12/23, 9:04 am - +260 97 6058891: Thank you very much
19/12/23, 9:08 am - +260 97 6058891: My long term goals are to acquire a quality education in engineering that will lead to a good paying job that will empower me to support the less privileged in my family and my community in general
19/12/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals! Your commitment to acquiring a quality education in engineering and using it to make a positive impact in your family and community is admirable. It's clear that you have a strong sense of purpose, aiming not only for personal success but also to uplift others. The path you've chosen is significant, and I'm here to support you as you work towards achieving these goals. 🚀
19/12/23, 9:21 am - +260 97 6058891: Thank you very much for acknowledging my goals and ambition
19/12/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/12/23, 9:31 am - +260 96 2284130: Thank you very much.  And as a family we welcome you too.
19/12/23, 9:32 am - +260 96 2284130: Am very excited that my son has reached this far and is now an Edoofian👏🏾👏🏾

19/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 6058891: May you explain further on the objectives
19/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
19/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/12/23, 9:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
19/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 6058891: Well explained and I understand clearly
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!
19/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 6058891: Thank you very much..I'm also looking forward to it
19/12/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing! <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning☀️
Wishing you a day filled with positivity, productivity, and moments that bring a smile to your face. 

So let's begin our today's session🚀
20/12/23, 8:40 am - +260 97 6058891: Good morning to you too yes we may begin
20/12/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 97 6058891: Noted clearly
20/12/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/12/23, 8:56 am - +260 97 6058891: Very interesting
20/12/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
