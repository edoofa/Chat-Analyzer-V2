I hope this message finds you well. I have noticed your continued *lack of attendance in our sessions is a matter of concern* I hope that you know that you are missing out on a lot of opportunities due to your absence. It is imperative that you promptly address this communication gap. Please reply without delay or provide a valid reason for your unresponsiveness.
📍Your immediate attention to this matter is expected.
