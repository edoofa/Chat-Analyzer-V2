Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

17/10/23, 9:00 am - +260 97 7885611: I was listening to the video sorry. Unfortunately we all share the same phone in my family. We only have 2 phones, so technically they are already joined in

17/10/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
17/10/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Lushomo, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
17/10/23, 9:19 am - +260 97 7885611: My long term goals will include 
-Entering university and get internship
-Study abroad to expand my knowledge and experience different cultures 
-Graduate with a high grade
Therefore EWYL program can help me as it will give me an opportunity to apply for casual/part-time positions on campus whose credits earned will help in mitigating my tuition fees. As the program fits within my study load, it will further help me gain relevant and practical experience which in turn will enhance my chances during job applications
17/10/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your long-term goals, such as entering university, studying abroad, and achieving high grades, are quite ambitious and admirable. The EWYL program is an ideal fit for your plans, as it provides opportunities that can contribute to your tuition fees. Additionally, the practical experience you'll gain through the program aligns perfectly with your career aspirations, making you more competitive in job applications. It's clear you've thought this through, and I'm here to support you in any way I can on this journey.
17/10/23, 9:22 am - +260 97 7885611: I really treasure your support and advise
17/10/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words!
17/10/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
17/10/23, 9:24 am - +260 97 7885611: Do you mean the objectives of EWYL or Edoofa?
17/10/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: The objectives of the EWYL, Lushomo.
17/10/23, 9:25 am - +260 97 7885611: Yez l think l understand
17/10/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Can you please brief me about them, so that I can make sure that we are on the same page.
17/10/23, 9:27 am - +260 97 7885611: 1. Provision of opportunities that contribute to tuition fees
2 Gaining of relevant and practical experience  which aligns with my career aspirations for job application
17/10/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, now let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
17/10/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
17/10/23, 9:30 am - +260 97 7885611: Well understood thank you
17/10/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
17/10/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

Yes we may go ahead
18/10/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: May I know why you are late for the session, are you facing any challenges?
18/10/23, 9:06 am - +260 97 7885611: Like l mentioned yesterday lam also attending class and preparing for my exams so lam tied for time
18/10/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Lushomo so may I know the timings of your classes?

18/10/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/10/23, 9:11 am - +260 97 7885611: This is interesting for me
18/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
18/10/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
18/10/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
18/10/23, 9:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: So we are wrapping up the session I must say it's been a wonderful interaction.We didn't get to some key discussions; please participate actively.
18/10/23, 9:57 am - +260 97 7885611: The print of the newsletter is tiny. Sorry it took me lots of time to read and my screen is small but have managed to read both of them. We will engage more next time
18/10/23, 10:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: I appreciate your effort in reading the newsletter despite the small print and your screen size. I'm glad to hear that you managed to go through both of them. Thank you for your dedication, and I look forward to our future discussions!
19/10/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good morning! ☀️
May your day be filled with positivity, productivity, and moments of joy.

Are you ready to begin today's session?

19/10/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
19/10/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Awesome!
19/10/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
19/10/23, 9:05 am - +260 97 7885611: That sounds great. Very intersection and looking forward
19/10/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great! Though I think you meant interesting
19/10/23, 9:08 am - +260 97 7885611: Sorry not intersection but interesting....you are right
19/10/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so let's move forward now.
19/10/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: , I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
19/10/23, 9:09 am - +260 97 7885611: Yes please
19/10/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
19/10/23, 9:42 am - +260 97 7885611: 1. My EWYL team comprise Ms Sanjana who is the HoD and monitors the discussions to enable further consultation whenever guidance is needed. My team also has Ms Davi who is the Head coach to mentor me throughout the journey using her content and structured CV. Finally the team has my mentor Ms Aditi who interacts with me almost everyday to help me achieve a rewarding experience. 
2. The goals set up by my mentor for my EWYL journey  are 3 and include;
-making great my academic journey
-making sure that adequate opportunities are provided for self financing my studies in India
-Attaining the objective of learning and evolving with the relevant 21 century skill meant to prepare me for the real world workplace and grow holistically 
3. The founder of Edoofa Mr Angaf Singh interacts with all students by means of a newsletter 
4 The hall of inspiration simply speaks out the maturity levels attained by an individual in all aspects of life. It is wisdom or level of mental development an individual attains starting from the way an individual conducts oneself all the way to how such individuals relate with others. It is a level normally attained after realising that certain goals even though not met, still excels an individual to attain this maturity

1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

I will be appearing for my Grade 12(Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
02/11/23, 2:08 pm - +260 97 7885611: I will try to identify such students and share with them this off line Application form
02/11/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
02/11/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
02/11/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students! <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 7885611: Looking forward to earning $55 worth of credits
02/11/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!'
02/11/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*LUSHOMO/ADITI/2NOV23*
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
02/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
02/11/23, 2:17 pm - +260 97 7885611: Keenly following
02/11/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
02/11/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________ a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zambia, where tuition fees range from ZKW 16,000 to ZWL 21,000 per year. When factoring in miscellaneous charges, such as the application fee, student welfare charges, library fees, and other deposits, the cost increases by K5000. Additionally, the cost of living is around K1200 per month.

On average, parents in Zambia spend between ZKW 35,000 and ZKW 40,000 per year at a public university, and sometimes students have to wait for one or two years to secure a spot in their desired course. Speaking to seniors, I realized that I might have to compromise on my course choice at a public university or endure a long wait. As for private universities, the costs are approximately double, making tertiary education unaffordable for my parents.

I have always wanted to support my family by partially funding my education through employment while studying, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn $50-$100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zambia, it's not without its challenges. I followed the 5'S, which helped me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these five pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
09/11/23, 11:50 am - +260 97 7885611: Happy Diwali to you. This is a wonderful moment. I will send my candle thanks

Hope you are well.

Wow, this is amazing.
So may I know what did you learn about Diwali's significance?
14/11/23, 10:11 am - +260 97 7885611: Significance of Diwali emphasises the triumph of light over darkness symbolized by the candles lit, the supremacy of knowledge over ignorance and finally the start of new beginnings
14/11/23, 10:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Absolutely, your insight into the significance of Diwali beautifully captures the essence of this joyous festival. The symbolism of light triumphing over darkness, reflected in the glowing candles and diyas, serves as a powerful metaphor for the victory of good over evil. It's a celebration that not only illuminates our surroundings but also inspires us to overcome ignorance with the brilliance of knowledge.😊🕯️🌟
15/11/23, 10:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
