19/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 263 6730: I think Nkazimulo is having network challenge , she's currently not rechargeable

Well my goals are to be a graduate in accounting and to be  an entrepreneur.l think that this EWYL program can help me achieve these goals in a few different ways.Firstly the program can provide me with the skills and knowledge l need to succeed in my degree program.
Secondly,the program can give me access to mentors and advisors who can help me navigate the process of being an entrepreneur
To add on, the program can connect me with other-like minded individuals who are also pursing their goals
19/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 386 8072: Noted
19/12/23, 11:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's an inspiring vision! 🌟 Becoming a graduate in accounting and an entrepreneur is a fantastic goal, and the Earn While You Learn program is your key to unlocking success! 🚀
Absolutely! Gaining skills and knowledge through the program will be your academic powerhouse. Indeed mentorship is a game-changer!

20/12/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning☀️
Wishing you a day filled with positivity, productivity, and moments that bring a smile to your face. 

So let's begin our today's session🚀
20/12/23, 8:32 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay
20/12/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/12/23, 8:34 am - +263 71 386 8072: No...can you explain further
20/12/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/12/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 71 386 8072: Thanks fir the explanation...now l understand
20/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 386 8072: *for
20/12/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 386 8072: Nice.... thanks for the introductions
20/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/12/23, 9:12 am - +263 71 386 8072: Yes
20/12/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

20/12/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263713868072  Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
20/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 386 8072: Okay let me read them
20/12/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
20/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 386 8072: Mr Angad has motivating and inspirational quotes that make you eager to make a change in your life and never to give up in life.l also like the fact that he states that one should spend their days wisely 💯and do something productive in life
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, those quotes are really motivating.
20/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 386 8072: I did notice the hall of inspiration.....yes it is indeed a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself... especially for the good deeds you have done.....l just hope that one day it's going to be me mentioned in the Edoofa Hall of inspiration 😌
20/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 386 8072: A lot
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
20/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
20/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 386 8072: Well these are great ideas...well l don't have any complaint to them😌
20/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
20/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
20/12/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
20/12/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Wrapping up this fantastic session for today—keep soaring higher! 🚀Embrace every step, and let your achievements be a testament to your dedication and growth. 💯

20/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 386 8072: 2.
1.Make sure that my academic journey is great
2.Ensure that l am given enough opportunities to self finance my education in India
3. Work towards attaining the objective that is relavant to  the 21st century skills
20/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 386 8072: 3.A
20/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 386 8072: I'd describe the "hall of inspiration" as a metaphorical place where people can go to feel motivated and excited about life. It's a place where people can learn from others, find their own inspiration, and discover their own passions. It's a place that helps people find their purpose and gives them the courage to pursue their dreams. It's a place that makes people feel hopeful, creative, and full of energy.
20/12/23, 9:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is Awesome, we will connect on it tomorrow.🚀
20/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 386 8072: Thank you ....have a good day

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?

21/12/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 386 8072: I just read the document that you sent and l realized that most of the things require one to have knowledge on ICT tools and so on which is not a big deal....but l do have a question on the projects .....l noticed that each project has activities so do l carry out the whole project or l will be doing per activity
21/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
21/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

21/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 386 8072: The "Corporate Alliance" project requires students to research companies in their area that are technology-driven and digitally focused. This will give them a better understanding of the current job market and the skills that are in demand.
They will also create LinkedIn profiles to connect with professionals and learn more about different industries. In doing so, they will be able to identify any gaps in their skills and work on developing those skills through the program.
21/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 386 8072: This will also help students to prepare for their future careers
21/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

21/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 386 8072: The document outlines four steps for identifying a company to work with. The first step is to identify your interests and passions. The second step is to research companies that align with your interests and passions. The third step is to contact companies that you're interested in and see if they have any opportunities available. The fourth and final step is to apply for those opportunities and start working with the company.
21/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 71 386 8072: Thank you for your time😌
