I am ready
06/11/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Kudakwashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
06/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Okay 
So it has always been my dream to play a significant part in the community that l grew up in and l can do so only if l get the opportunity to be a Civil Engineer and so my long-term goal is to improve the standards of living of my fellow citizens by playing part in infrastructure development because my country particularly my community that the moment lags far behind when it comes to roads, bridges and administration buildings to mention just but a few.The EWYL program will help me to be able to fulfill my dreams by teaching me the basic skills l need and at the same time earning from learning from you as well
06/11/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's a truly commendable dream, and it's wonderful to hear about your aspirations to make a significant impact on your community. Becoming a Civil Engineer and contributing to infrastructure development is a noble goal, especially in areas where improvements are much needed.
I'm here to support you in your journey, and I'm excited to be a part of your learning process. 🌟👷‍♂️
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Sorry for the late reply
My network connection is really poor due to power outages
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand!
06/11/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you ma’am!
06/11/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: May I also have a response on this.
06/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma’am
06/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 359 5826: The two objectives?
06/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 359 5826: The objectives are:
1.To make higher education affordable.
2.To provide theoretical and practical education to its learners
06/11/23, 3:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/11/23, 3:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you ma’am!
I now understand the objectives better
06/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
06/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Thank you ma’am for your time.
Hopefully my network will be better in our next session

20/11/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Yes!
Monday and Thursday will work for me.
20/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Unfortunately l cannot connect with you on Saturday because that's the day l will be at church so will not be active on WhatsApp on this day.
20/11/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263772297277 For now you would have to connect with me every day and the choice will be shared when we have completed the initial orientation.
20/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 229 7277: Understood!
20/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
20/11/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Newsletter 1.pdf (file attached)

20/11/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma'am l did notice the Edoofa Hall of Inspiration and its such a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself!
20/11/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/11/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:

21/11/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 359 5826: Sorry ma'am for the late reply
I had to read the document twice so that l don't miss any point.
21/11/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, but you have to put in efforts to make the session productive
21/11/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we will meet at the second half and continue the session till then submit your understanding.
21/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 359 5826: Okay so basically the document is about the projects that have been designed by the EWYL team that l have to be part of inorder to score scholarship credits.

The first part of the document was explaining how business operations are fast changing as most of the operations are being held online in this post COVID-19 era and the skills that one has to attain for him/her to be useful in the future.These skills include social media literacy, digital literacy ,creative content writing, data analysis and remote team work.
21/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 359 5826: The first project is Corporate Alliances and it is basically about representing Edoofa to other companies to build a strong professional network with these companies as well as potential employers.

This project improves one's networking skills, good communication skills and digital literacy as one gets to use professional networking websites.It also helps in one's mindset as one might face rejections which will help to build a "never give up" attitude.

The project includes identifying local organizations and companies in mu region and identifying the decision makers of these companies.Afterwards l have to reach out to these companies on behalf of Edoofa and share Edoofa's vision, its mission and the work they do.I also have to arrange for a call meeting between the two parties that is Edoofa and the organization  call and finally facilitate in the signing of contract with these organizations.

This project will result in me getting $32 worth of scholarship credits per organization.
21/11/23, 10:24 am - +263 71 359 5826: The second project is for me to persuade my personal networks that's my friends, relatives and former schoolmates as well as my extended networks to be partake  in this life-changing opportunity to be part of the Edoofa family.This exercise will also improve my networking skills as well as my persuasion skills apart from the minimum $55 worth of scholarship credits for every student who successfully becomes an Edoofia.
21/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 359 5826: The last project is for me to reach out to senior secondary schools in my region and for me to speak to the decision makers of these particular schools to collaborate with Edoofa.
This project is a non commercial tie up but its major  objective is for Edoofa to help schools in  areas such as sharing of world class technology and innovations as well as career counselling.
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for the session🚀
21/11/23, 2:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

21/11/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263713595826 I would appreciate it if you could make an effort to remain engaged during your sessions.
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 359 5826: I have learnt that the objective of the first project that is Corporate Alliance is for me familiarize myself with the market in which  l would want to work in ,in the future.I have to identify companies that are technologically driven.After identifying them, l have to market Edoofa to them explaining this organization's objectives as well as how Edoofa has been assisting me and then l have to link the organizations to Edoofa
21/11/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing, I’m happy with your understanding.
21/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 359 5826: My network is not performing very well and as a result the messages are taking longer than expected to be sent back to you.

22/11/23, 7:29 am - +263 77 229 7277: From the Guide for Searching Companies, l have learnt the steps l will use to get to the founders of companies.These companies much be ystudent-centric or content-centic or recreational in nature.They must also be financially stable and the scale of the employees of the companies much range from 50-200.The information pertaining to these companies can be found on social media platforms as well as on google and on LinkedIn.
22/11/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Rise and shine to a brand new day filled with possibilities! 🎉

22/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 229 7277: We are having power shortages and as a result l was unable to recharge my cellphone so l will be using my father's for today's sessions.

22/11/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you may ask.
22/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 229 7277: From the  audio you sent, l understood that the corporates l have to look for are those that are related to the job l would want to do when l finish school but from the guide it seems as if the corporates have to either be student-centric, recreational or content-centric of which these natures do not quite align with my desired future job.
22/11/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: This is amazing!
You are absolutely correct.
22/11/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

22/11/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can surely do it but then not as a representative of Edoofa, you can do it for your personal reach.
22/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 229 7277: Okay, l understand.
22/11/23, 8:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.

22/11/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
But let me tell you if you utilize your time focusing on other projects it will be beneficial and when we resume with this project I will let you know.
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!

22/11/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
22/11/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 229 7277: Okay, so the second project is  community building which is basically about me sharing this opportunity that l was given to be part of the Edoofa family to other African students who have not received the same opportunity so that they might as well be part of this beautiful family.This can be done using social media platforms and as l result l get scholarship credits for every student who manages to be an Edoofian that l would have reached out to.

23/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
23/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
23/11/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: _Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.
12/12/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
