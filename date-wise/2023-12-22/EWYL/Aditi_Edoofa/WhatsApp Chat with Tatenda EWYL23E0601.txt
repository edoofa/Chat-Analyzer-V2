02/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Nice to meet you Ms Aditi
02/09/23, 12:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
02/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok  Ms Aditi . Thank you so much 


Yes indeed I guarantee you a rewarding experience

I hope you are doing really well.

So, are you ready to start our session?
04/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 040 6011: Morning Ms Aditi . How are you today
04/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 040 6011: Yes i am ready
04/09/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
04/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 040 6011: That’s great
04/09/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: So  Tatenda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
04/09/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ok


 I want to  be a highly educated person in   life , have a good job and i also want to be an entrepreneur. I want to be able to start my own businesses organization  both beneficiary and non beneficiary.

The EWYL program will help me  achieve these goals through the credits that i earn while I learn. These credits will then help me reduce my cost of education therefore making my education more affordable
04/09/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I must say you are an ambitious student.
04/09/23, 9:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 040 6011: Thank you mam
04/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 040 6011: No. I am not aware about the two objectives
04/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ok  mam thank you for clarifying the  objectives
04/09/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
04/09/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now please go through these objectives.
04/09/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
04/09/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 040 6011: Ok

04/09/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay. <This message was edited>
04/09/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Please let me know once it is done.
04/09/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 040 6011: Yeah its done 

I have read  the experience of  Mihlayonke Ndlovu
04/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I hope you are motivated to earn credits yourself, right?
04/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 040 6011: Yes mam i am well motivated
04/09/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. <This message was edited>

08/09/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay great!
08/09/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
08/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Okay
08/09/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
08/09/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes ma’am

08/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Still downloading
08/09/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Well  as for me if i say i liked this session the most i will be lying because as you said each section has its taste and interest
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is true!
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
08/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes ma’am  that’s true
08/09/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tatenda?
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Sounds very interesting  indeed
08/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
08/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes ma’am

14/09/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok ma’am i will forward the forms once they are filled 



One more question ma’am what if some of them are in the process of enrolling or they are already enrolled with Edoofa. Can i also give them the form??
14/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: No, Tatenda then there will be no point of getting the form filled.
14/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!

14/09/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope this also clarifies your doubts.
14/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 040 6011: It is indeed interesting
14/09/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes it does
14/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok ma’am . Go ahead
14/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*TATENDA/ADITI/14SEPT23*
14/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/09/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

14/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Well noted ma’am
14/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/09/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
14/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok ma’am i will do so

14/09/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
14/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
14/09/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
14/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok ma’am
14/09/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

14/09/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, True.
14/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you have explained to the student as we have discussed right?
14/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok ma’am
14/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward.

20/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ma’am are you available at the moment??


I am hearing stories that there might be an economics seminar today at our school after lunch so I wanted to know is you are available so that we can go through with today’s session now
20/09/23, 12:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Though I am a bit busy but I can manage for you.
20/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ok ma’am 


So we can start today’s session now
20/09/23, 12:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/09/23, 12:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Well right now i have no questions 
But if i come across any challenge or if there is need for clarification while I finish the the first and the  second project i will inform you ma’am
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure.
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
20/09/23, 1:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes ma’am  i am curious
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
20/09/23, 1:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
20/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Yes ma’am i am aware of them but can you explain what is SEO
20/09/23, 1:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure,
*SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
20/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ohh ok ma’am  thank you for the clarification
20/09/23, 1:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
20/09/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Noted ma’am
20/09/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Noted
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Tuesday and Friday
20/09/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
20/09/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 040 6011: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You look great!
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Well noted ma’am
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Thank you ma’am
20/09/23, 2:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 12:00- 01:00 PM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
20/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Noted ma’am
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.

There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
20/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 040 6011: Ma’am i am now going offline for now i have to attend the seminar
