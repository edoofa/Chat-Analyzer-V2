Hope that you are doing well.

Let's begin with our today's discussions🚀
03/08/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Good afternoon
03/08/23, 12:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Belinda, may I know the reason of your irregularity in our discussions, are you facing any challenges?
03/08/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 273 3391: We were busy at school. I am writing my examination this year so I am also involved in a lot of extra lessons.
03/08/23, 1:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright! so Belinda would you be able to manage your EWYL journey along with your school?
03/08/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 273 3391: Only I don't know how demanding it is.
03/08/23, 1:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
03/08/23, 1:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know if it's fine with you?
