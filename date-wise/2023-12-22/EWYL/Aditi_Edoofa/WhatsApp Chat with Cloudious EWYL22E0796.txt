Firstly I learn that the easiest way of doing great things is by breaking it into small parts. Again, the best way of success in every thing you are doing is to put all your effort on it and hardworking. Lastly  blogging shot is a way of expressing your self skills as well as to earn
16/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
16/11/23, 8:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
16/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 918 2630: I am following
16/11/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
16/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 918 2630: OK let me create I will share it with you
16/11/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
16/11/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
16/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 918 2630: Tuesday and Friday
16/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay!
16/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
16/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/11/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/11/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/11/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/11/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: I've noticed that you've been leaving my messages on "Seen" without responding.
Your responsibility as a mentee includes actively engaging in conversations, seeking guidance when needed, and keeping me updated on your progress. Ignoring messages, even unintentionally, can hinder our ability to work together effectively and achieve your goals.


If you're facing challenges or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Our communication should be a two-way street, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
16/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 918 2630: OK Ms  I understand
16/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 918 2630: I am done
16/11/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/11/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 918 2630: I understand that is good
16/11/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 12:00- 1:30 PM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
16/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 918 2630: I understand
16/11/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
16/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 918 2630: I am glad to hear that thank  you
16/11/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Cloudious, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions and will follow the Proud Edoofian ritual daily.
16/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 918 2630: It's OK Ms

Your proud EDOOFIAN is doing well 

My story goes like this when I was doing my Advanced Level there was a shortage of textbooks at our School so we were asked to buy laptops.  By that time we failed to raise the amount of buying laptop. Because of that situation I evaluate the purpose of laptop and I observed that my smartphone can do it. Finally I use my smartphone to keep those textbooks and other stuff that was supposed to be kept in laptop

Some students were laughing at me(you know at school we meet students with different characters) just because I was using cellphone instead of laptop but I  wasn't disappointed and I ignore them because I was looking forward to achieve my goal so that I can fulfill my dreams.
20/11/23, 10:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Cloudious!
