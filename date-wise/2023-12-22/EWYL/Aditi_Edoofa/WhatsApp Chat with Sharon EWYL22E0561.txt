19/10/23, 4:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you, my student💯. Here are the pointers for your help.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 12:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

15/11/23, 4:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263717769002 I'm quite let down because you didn't show up for your scheduled session today.
15/11/23, 4:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,

27/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 71 776 9002: Greetings to you Ms Aditi, my apologies for not being able to connect with you for our planned sessions
27/11/23, 1:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263717769002 , 
I hope you are doing well. _*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Date: 27/11/2023*
*Time: 7:00 PM*
27/11/23, 1:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sharon, may I know if you were facing any challenges?
27/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Okay maam
27/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 776 9002: It's just that my schedule has been super tight maam and itwas hard for me to make it for our sessions
27/11/23, 1:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so would you also like to tell me about your schedule so that I can understand and schedule our sessions in future accordingly.
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 776 9002: I get home at 6 maam and lately I have been arriving even later than that because of traffic jam, so instead of taking a bus i was now taking a rikshaw and it would take forever to get me home. When I get home I would be tired and having assignments and I also need to cook, so it would just be too much and i end up losing track of time and forgetting about my sessions

However i will try my best to make sure i make it next time.
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, good evening!🌸
Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand.
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam we may begin
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Definitely I am curious ☺️
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam I remember that
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 776 9002: No I do not remember maam
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Don't worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Ok maam now I'm aware
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 776 9002: I'm following maam
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Noted
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	        1/6
Attendance	3/6
Orientation	Present
Fee status	CLEAR
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Okay maam I've taken note of the information you are sharing
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Okay maam
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam, most definitely!
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam and I understand that
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam,thank you so much

29/11/23, 4:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Time for today's Wednesday lesson, it covers a topic that is fundamental to your academic and personal growth: "The Power of Analysis: Unleashing Your Potential Through Input-Output."

Analytical skills are crucial not only for your academic success but also for your future endeavors in the professional world. This lesson aims to equip you with valuable tools and perspectives that will enhance your problem-solving abilities and decision-making processes.

Remember to jot down any questions or thoughts that arise during your reading, as we will have an engaging discussion during our next session. Your active participation is highly encouraged, as it contributes to a dynamic and enriching learning environment.

If you encounter any difficulties or have specific questions while going through the material, don't hesitate to reach out. I am here to assist you in grasping the concepts and making the most of this learning opportunity.

29/11/23, 4:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263717769002  I'm quite let down because you didn't show up for your scheduled session today, please give a reason for missing today's session. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 4:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263717769002  I want to schedule a session especially with you *tomorrow at 6 PM*. Make sure that you take out time for me and I hope it's not difficult for you to take out one hour out for your mentor.
30/11/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good day Sharon!
Hope you are well.

I hope you are all pumped up for today's session.🚀
30/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam  surely
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 776 9002: I believe this can be achieved only through hardwork and determination maam.Im ready to take on e challenge
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready. <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam.noted
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Thank you maam, I will not let you down
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As our grant sessions wrap up, let's gear up and dive into the projects to earn those well-deserved scholarship credits! Get ready for an exciting journey ahead!
On that note are you ready for the $300 training?
30/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Yes maam, definitely
30/11/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As your mentor, I have always strived to ensure you get enough opportunities to self-finance your education. I have worked hard every step of the way with you to enhance your performance and skills to do well in your project opportunities. In other attempts to meet our objectives, I have always tried to have a rewarding system that helps all our Edoofians earn considerable credits that help reduce the burden of their sponsors and parents back in their home country.
30/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Your efforts are greatly appreciated maam
30/11/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you!
30/11/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today we’ll be focusing on training you to ace this project. As all of you are aware the rewards/credits for this project have been revised and increased to 300$, which calls for better performance, increased effort, and a better approach to the project. Let’s learn more!
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The essence of honesty and transparency in communication yields the best outcomes. Grateful for your presence in India, the goal is to extend that gratitude by sharing the conveniences of your new life, such as uninterrupted electricity and nearly free internet, with your loved ones. This project aims to hone your storytelling skills, fostering confidence, creativity, empathy, and perspective, while also enhancing presentation abilities. As part of the training, you'll guide others on sharing their stories and be empowered to select community members based on readiness. Your involvement continues with the deep engagement of shortlisting applicants post-training.
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Understood
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, from now on, you won't only be a student dedicated to community building; you'll also assume the role of an Edoofa certified student leader. This means you'll have an expanded responsibility in guiding and supporting your fellow students while continuing your valuable work in the community. Your role as a student leader is a significant step forward, and we believe it will bring about positive changes in your academic journey and community impact.

Only the forms submitted by the Edoofa Certified Student Leaders will be accepted. You will be given a certificate after you successfully complete your training on this project with your mentors.
30/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Okay maam😊
30/11/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now your task is to answer the following questions then I will share the answers of the same.I hope it's clear.


1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship
Program?
2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?
3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain
to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.
4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Should I do it now maam?
30/11/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 776 9002: 1.To apply you simply fill out your application form and submit it, have your counselling session and make sure you pay the requested admission fee once accepted into the Edoofa scholar program with no delay

2.I chose Edoofa program over other agents and consultants because they guide you right from the counselling session till the day you begin your classes in India, they are not just agents but they also take a role of a guardian in the Edoofians lives and they always have the best interests at heart. The other reason was the ability to be able to self finance my studies.

3.The uniqueness of the Edoofa Program is that it also gives us a platform to learn different skill sets that will aid us in the future through the webinars, saturday activities and it also motivates us through the Wednesday wisdom.lessons

4. India is a dream destination for education for Africans because firstly life is affordable here and they offer quality education
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This is really fantastic! I believe you're starting your projects with a fresh perspective and a stronger focus on getting great results. You've got what it takes, and your potential is unlimited!
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You can refer to this document's *Training Resources* for the correct answers.
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sharon, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.


And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our Edoofa Certified Student Leader🏆
30/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Thank you maam for the opportunity😇
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'd like to begin by explaining you a task that you are supposed to do as mentioned under the Grant eligibility.
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So as your task, you are supposed to create a video of yourself explaining your journey with Edoofa as this video will be used by our counselors in case of the $300 Forms Counseling referred by you, so as to ensure your scholarship credits as this video will ensure that the student is aware of the Program by you.
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help for your new task to creat a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

a) Your journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
30/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Okay maam I will be working on the video
30/11/23, 3:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

30/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Maam may I know if I can get a copy of the grant letter?
30/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 776 9002: Okay maam noted

13/12/23, 11:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

Guess what? We're halfway through the marathon, with only few days left to crush it in the grant game! 🏁✨

Let me spill some tea – one of our rockstar students flipped his eligibility from "not eligible" to "grant-ready" last month! How, you ask? By showing up to every call, putting in his 100% on projects, and making it happen. 🌟
18/12/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I get it, exams are breathing down your necks, but fear not! Our meetings maybe once a week, but let's make every second count. 🕰️

*To keep the momentum rolling, I want you to set a target to submit at least one application for a $300 plan by Monday!* 🚀💸
Let's do this!
