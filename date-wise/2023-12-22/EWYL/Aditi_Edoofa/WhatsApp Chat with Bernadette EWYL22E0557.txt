I did attend the webinar and it was  insightful. He was addressing why we need to consider and try the concept of entrepreneurship although it's not guaranteed that you will succeed in it.When it comes to digital marketing skills he told us to have that analytical skill because it's not always that you need to accept anything presented to you.You need to be sure if it's of relevance to what you want .You have to acquire as much  21st century skills as you can and most of all to keep networking and updating our LinkedIn in profiles for they say much about ourselves and they unlock good opportunities for us.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

a) Your journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

09/12/23, 4:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 4:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's Saturday Activity that aims to acquaint us with Microsoft Excel, a potent tool for sorting and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a simple yet useful exercise: crafting a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel: Start Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, any available spreadsheet software will suffice.
Set Up Columns: Establish three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities: Recall your activities from the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.
Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.
Calculate Average Time: Utilize Excel functions to find the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect: Allocate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll enhance these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you face any challenges. Let's delve into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!

Warm regards,
Team EWYL.
09/12/23, 4:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263772244542 @917814659163 I understand that you are busy with your studies but a sa mentor it would be appreciated if you would communicate that you won't be attending the session, okay?
13/12/23, 11:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

16/12/23, 5:06 pm - +91 78146 59163: You didn't show up at the stipulated time so I switched onto my studies instead
16/12/23, 5:06 pm - +91 78146 59163: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 5:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @917814659163 You know that it might take a few minutes to receive your request and in this case, you should have texted in the group, right. <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 5:08 pm - +91 78146 59163: I'm running out time ma'am every second is precious for my end terms
16/12/23, 5:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, Bernadette!
I believe, as your mentor, I have the right to be informed.
16/12/23, 5:21 pm - +91 78146 59163: I don't even have the motivation ma'am you told me I don't deserve the grant which I worked for at home yet you are aligning it with the 75% attendance after I came to India.
16/12/23, 5:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand that you're feeling demotivated. It's important to discuss and as you were well aware when you were given the grant there are certain conditions to be fulfilled and they were mentioned in your Grant as well as they must be discussed by your previous mentor as well.
16/12/23, 5:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And you didn't even attend the grant discussion sessions,
16/12/23, 5:27 pm - +91 78146 59163: That is not true ma'am cz the conditions of the grant came right after we came here otherwise on Edoofa conference hosted in Harare they told us about our grants and that we wud receive our certificates once we get back home in our EWYL groups
16/12/23, 5:30 pm - +91 78146 59163: Why should I ma'am? For me to get demotivated more by the conditions set after my hardwork?I'm sure you don't realize how much money was spent for all those projects when I was still at home it's even more than one year's university school fees and my Dad knows that very well because he sacrificed every bit of the money he got on wifi so I can attend as much sessions and Webinar as I can
16/12/23, 5:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your dedication and hard work. It seems there might be some miscommunication or changes in the conditions that were not clearly communicated. Bernadette, it was clearly mentioned that you have to maintain 75% attendance to redeem the grant.
16/12/23, 5:33 pm - +91 78146 59163: My question is why are those two things Linked?
16/12/23, 5:34 pm - +91 78146 59163: Did I get the grant when I came to India or before I got here ?why are the conditions on something we worked for while we were at home?explain why
16/12/23, 5:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your questions regarding the timing of the grant conditions. It's important to address these matters transparently. The conditions were communicated after you arrived in India, and I acknowledge that this may have caused confusion and raised questions about the process.The intention behind sharing the conditions after your arrival was to ensure clarity and provide a comprehensive overview of expectations. However, I realize that this might not align with the expectations set during the Edoofa conference in Harare. I apologize for any confusion or frustration this may have caused.Your dedication and hard work, especially during the projects back home, are valued and recognized.
16/12/23, 5:42 pm - +91 78146 59163: It pains me the most because I deprived my parents of every bit of money they had and even the money that was supposed to take care of my siblings just to work hard so I can pay for my fees.I was ready to continue working hard so as to reduce the financial burden on them but you do not get it at all.Now how am I supposed to self-finance my own education If conditions are laid on my hardwork.Even to those who go to work they are rewarded of their hardwork then why do I have to suffer more if my efforts are in vain like this?
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *🎄✨Wishing you a joyous holiday season! 🌟🎁*

As we dive into the hustle of exams and eagerly anticipate the magic of Christmas, here's some fantastic news for you:

20/12/23, 11:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hye Bernadette!
Hope you are well.


Bernadette, your presence has been incredibly meaningful in the Edoofa community I want you to know that I took the time to review your past performance because you've been an exceptional student. You've left a lasting impact on your previous mentors, and I saw your history of the grant performance and it was indeed amazing.

Also, I would like to address the challenges that you are facing regarding the grant.
20/12/23, 11:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Why were you given the grant?*

Bernadette the grant was given to you since you were an exceptionally hard-working student back in Africa so to acknowledge the efforts and discipline you have put into the projects and EWYL Program you were given the grant.
Also, God Forbid if in case in any semester you are not able to earn credits to self-finance your education you have a grant amount as a backup for the help, and it doesn't mean that it is a cash reserve for you.
20/12/23, 11:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Why is it important to maintain 75% attendance in the sessions, even when you are in India?*

Bernadette, you were supposed to keep on earning the scholarship credits to self-finance your education which is the core of the EWYL Program, please note that the grant isn't cash reserve, it is something that should be maintained.
For example, if you win a scholarship, you have to work hard and maintain good grades throughout to retain that scholarship, I hope that you know that if your grades drop your scholarship will be taken away, right?
This is a universal example and this is how institutions operate, Bernadette.
20/12/23, 11:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Bernadette, Mr. Angad personally awarded you the grant because we as a team recognized your exceptional potential as an exceptionally bright student. However, I observed that you haven't attended the sessions or webinars organized to upskill yourself. And there's been a decline in your project involvement since you came to India, which leaves the impression that you haven't put in enough effort to retain the grant given to you.

20/12/23, 4:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Bernadette, can you please specify and elaborate what you are trying to communicate?
20/12/23, 4:07 pm - +91 78146 59163: I'm saying nevermind that wasn't for you I was in a discussion
20/12/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright Bernadette, do you feel that your queries were resolved?
20/12/23, 4:13 pm - +91 78146 59163: Yes you told me I have to maintain my grant like scholarship
