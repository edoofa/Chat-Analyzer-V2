It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 324 2816: Yes but tomorrow I might be busy since I'm starting my mid term but I'll try to be there
10/10/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday

⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

 I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 324 2816: Yes
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 324 2816: Yes
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts.
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

27/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 324 2816: Thank mentor i appreciate

27/11/23, 3:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

12/12/23, 4:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Conrad that is true. This is indeed a good start to go about it. But what you have written is not very clear. Your answer does not reflect an in depth understanding rather it looks very generic.
Working hard in the community building project should be a first and foremost priority, given the fact that you are gaining $300 directly.
12/12/23, 4:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: All you need is to inculcate the fact in your heart and soul that the more you work in the projects, the more financial independence and confidence you are earning.
13/12/23, 1:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Wednesday, Conrad🌻

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

16/12/23, 6:49 am - +263 71 324 2816: Title: "The Clockmaker's Legacy"

Once upon a time in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and ancient forests, there lived a skilled clockmaker named Eli. Eli was known throughout the land for his intricate timepieces that not only measured hours but seemed to capture the very essence of time itself.

Eli's small shop, tucked away on the village's cobblestone street, was a haven for those who sought precision and beauty in their daily lives. However, Eli wasn't just admired for his craftsmanship; he was revered for his unwavering integrity and diligence.

One day, a mysterious traveler named Isabella visited Eli's shop. She had heard tales of the legendary clockmaker and wanted a special timepiece crafted to commemorate her life's journey. Eli, known for his discretion, listened intently to Isabella's stories and dreams.

As Eli meticulously worked on the masterpiece, he discovered that Isabella had faced many trials and triumphs. Her tales spoke of perseverance, kindness, and the pursuit of knowledge. Inspired by her life, Eli decided to infuse these virtues into the very heart of the timepiece.

The clock, when finished, not only accurately marked the passage of time but also bore intricate engravings that depicted Isabella's virtues. As a surprise gift, Eli engraved a small dedication: "To those who value integrity and diligence, may your time be forever blessed."

News of the extraordinary clock spread, and soon, people from all corners of the kingdom flocked to Eli's shop. Each person, eager to share their story, hoped to have a timepiece crafted that reflected their own journey and values.

Eli, true to his principles, worked tirelessly, weaving the tales of courage, love, and wisdom into the heart of every clock. The village became a gathering place for those who appreciated the virtues of integrity and diligence, and Eli's shop became a symbol of inspiration.

In time, the village itself transformed. The people, inspired by the stories within the clocks, embraced the values of integrity and diligence. Acts of kindness and perseverance became the norm, and the village prospered not only in material wealth but in the richness of its people's characters.

As the years passed, Eli's legacy lived on. The enchanted clocks, now passed down through generations, continued to tell the tales of those who valued integrity and diligence. The village, once humble, became a beacon of light, and Eli's timeless creations served as a reminder that the true measure of a life well-lived was not in wealth or fame but in the virtues woven into the fabric of one's existence.
