15/09/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 310 7860: I really appreaciate your sense lets try in the evening .Really we do not want to leg behind so we are to coerce in the evening.I think even network appreaciate better at night.
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 310 7860: Sorry all e above are hard to take .ie Monday tuesday and wednesday sessions at 830am-930am is school time and no phone is allowed.
Then same days @ 130am -230am its time to rest after studies from 800pm-1200am.
Saturday we are having weekend lessons so i can hardly accept any of the sessions now as long schools are open.Is it not possible to resume in november because we finish exams early november.May u please bear with us.
21/10/23, 5:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening,
I hope everything is going well for you. I understand that your child isn't currently available to begin the "Earn While You Learn" program. However, I'd like to suggest if you could complete the initial orientation part with me today.

Could you let me know if this is possible for you?
21/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 310 7860: Welcome  .How are u?
21/10/23, 8:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening,

21/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 310 7860: I'm her father.
21/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 310 7860: She is busy with her exams upto  the 3rd of November.
21/10/23, 9:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since I will be connected to your child for the longest period and I will be their mentor, guide, and friend throughout the journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when they are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
21/10/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 310 7860: I have understood  your profile.lm happy to have a seasoned  mentor for my child.Let it be a true picture to help    guide my daughter.My fear is to let go my child to someone  without the needed  knowledge  to protect  & help these young kids.

19/12/23, 12:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Salma and Parents*
How are you doing today? You know, while I was traveling to the office today, I thought that we were already late to begin our EWYL journey and work on the project, as you were occupied with your exams. So, I was thinking of connecting daily here in your EWYL group.

This way, I can ensure proper guidance and an effective path to work on your project, maximizing scholarship credits. *Therefore, from now on, let us connect at 1:30 pm in the afternoon in your EWYL group to proceed with your EWYL journey*!
May I know will that is okay?
19/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 310 7860: Yeah that's okay
20/12/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, Salma
That sounds fantastic! We will begin following this timetable starting tomorrow, and you must be punctual.

 Additionally, I'd like to give you a little homework. Kindly scroll through our previous conversations, and afterward, share what you recall from our past discussions. 
Can you complete this before our session tomorrow?
20/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 499 9314: Umm I got a new WhatsApp so I lost those messages
21/12/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Salma*
