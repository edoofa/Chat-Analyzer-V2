I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

07/12/23, 12:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Nozizwe. After that I sent you a message that I am available for the session. 
You could have joined whenever you were ready.
07/12/23, 12:33 pm - +27 62 261 9611: That was about the Instagram page ma'am, nothing related to the message I had sent
07/12/23, 12:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I agree but don't you think it was your responsibility to acknowledge that. How would I know that you are available or not. 
If you were finding it hard to visit the page, you could have told me

07/12/23, 1:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, That would be really appreciated Nozizwe.
09/12/23, 7:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 7:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 7:45 am - +91 98726 06204: Which grant?
09/12/23, 7:46 am - +91 98726 06204: Good morning
09/12/23, 8:05 am - +27 78 696 0086: Good morning Ms Jasmine.  I am Nozizwe's mom. Thank you for all the correspondence which has been communicated to Nozizwe and the effort she is doing in balancing the Edoofa program and also her LPU studies.

We need clarity on the 300 grant which Nozizwe was granted This was after provided names of people who would love to be part of the Edoofa and other assignments you gave her which made you give her the grant.

 That grant Nozizwe has not used it and it was our understanding that she intended to ask Ms Jasmine if the 300 can be deducted from the current school  fee.

Would you be so kind to clarify which grant Nozizwe is now NOT ELIGIBLE.for us to understand.  

From our little knowledge these Grant's will be granted throughout her education based on her performance.  You gave her the grant and approved the 300 based on her previous performance and it was granted.

The one you are referring to as NOT ELIGIBLE is it based on the current marks or does it refer to the grant that you had initially granted her?
09/12/23, 8:30 am - +27 78 696 0086: My correction the grant was given for people that participated on a challenge.
09/12/23, 8:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Nozizwe, do you remember the 21 days challenge that was happened when you were back their home?
09/12/23, 8:26 pm - +91 98726 06204: Yes
09/12/23, 8:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening! Let me clarify the situation. There are two distinct aspects:

1. *$300 Plan for Community Building:* Nozizwe had the chance to earn $300 by working on the Community Building project. The more effort she puts in, the more credits she can earn.

2. *21-Day Grant Challenge:* Back there in Africa, Nozizwe participated in a grant challenge that lasted for 21 days. Following the grant, certain terms and conditions were outlined in the grant letter. One condition specified that Nozizwe must maintain attendance of more than 75% in both the EWYL sessions and webinars. Unfortunately, she has not met this requirement until November. As a result, she is currently ineligible for the grant.
09/12/23, 8:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well.

Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
