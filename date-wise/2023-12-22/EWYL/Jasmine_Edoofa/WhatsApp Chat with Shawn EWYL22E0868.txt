Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

17/08/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

17/08/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 554 1999: Ooh well understood
17/08/23, 4:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you have any more questions?

29/08/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

27/11/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Ok ma'am kindly tell me hw  much amount I have both of them
27/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your annual grant amount is 150$
Scholarship credits earned - 22$
27/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Oooh ok ma'am
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Ok ok ma'am
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Shawn, do you remember your total Grant amount?
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 434 3833: 600
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Am not sure ma'am
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It is 450$
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 434 3833: 😹😹ok ma'am
27/11/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 

A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
27/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 434 3833: So you didn't include November
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since we are still in November, we have not evaluated your performance in November yet.
27/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 434 3833: I think my attendance n webinar are not correct ma'am because I have attended all of them
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Ok 🆗
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 4:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Shawn. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $450 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $22. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Ok ok understood
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Ok ma'am
27/11/23, 4:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Noted ma'am ☺️
27/11/23, 4:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
27/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 434 3833: 🆗 Ok 🆗
27/11/23, 5:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 5:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
Since we have not completed the session, I will schdule one more session tomorrow. Make sure you are on time. 
Goodnight!
27/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Oooh ok ma'am

28/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 434 3833: No, I don't
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 434 3833: Noted ma'am

09/12/23, 8:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that.

09/12/23, 10:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Shawn, it's important to clarify that merely registering for webinars is insufficient. Attending the entire webinar is a prerequisite, and we meticulously track the duration of each student's participation. Your lack of recorded attendance suggests that you either haven't attended the webinar or have not stayed for the full duration.
09/12/23, 10:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would really appreciate that.
09/12/23, 10:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").

13/12/23, 1:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *GRANT UPDATE*
Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
13/12/23, 1:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

Yes, a full-on break!

If you ever want to connect with me during the break, just drop me a message in our EWYL GROUP between 6-8 pm. If I need to share any updates during the break, I'll be reaching out every alternate day during this time. So, make sure you're around and ready to catch up on those days.

*Now, since it's a break, I don't want to stress you out with goals. Instead, I want to know what YOU want to do.* How many applications are you planning to submit when we kick back into gear on January 6th?

Wishing you the happiest of holidays, filled with joy, relaxation, and moments of warmth. I'll undoubtedly miss our interactions, but I'm eagerly looking forward to reconnecting on January 6th. 🌲🎁

21/12/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Tick- tock, Tick-tock: What are your plans for Christmas?_* 🕰️

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us.
See how diligently your parents have supported you that you have come this far, now this is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this Christmas, give them a sense of financial relief as you have a chance to earn way more than what you have got, so go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. 
What did you think? What are your plans now?
21/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 434 3833: No plans ma'am 😕 because am writing exams till 1jan
