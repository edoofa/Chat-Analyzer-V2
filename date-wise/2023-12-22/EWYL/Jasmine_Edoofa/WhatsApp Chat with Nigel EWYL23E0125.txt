You didn't come for the session today. Is everything okay? 
If you are facing any challenges then feel free to discuss.
04/08/23, 3:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?
05/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 406 2393: I am not sure ma'am, my parents are still organizing the financial arrangements
06/08/23, 7:17 am - +27 84 209 6026: Halo mam how are you? We are having some challenges in putting up all the necessarry and required documents for your student to arrive on time. We have brought that to the attention of our admission officer and also asking for a possible postponement of his arrival or for him to commence his programme at a later date. He has not yet responded to us so we are still waiting for his response to find the way forward. So as a result of this i have just noticed that the boy is devastated and his mind is all over the place and it has affected his concentration even at home. I kindly ask you mam to please bear with us while we sort out this issue and if possible ca he be excused from his sessions for a week o so until everything is sorted. Your assistance in this regard will be greatly appriciated. Thank you.
07/08/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon
Please know that I fully empathize with the difficulties you are going through, and I will do my best to support you during this time. I'll personally reach out to the admissions officer to discuss the matter and expedite the process. I want to ensure that we find a suitable solution and alleviate the student's distress as soon as possible.
07/08/23, 6:22 pm - +27 84 209 6026: Good evening mam. Thank you so much for understanding our situation. We are also looking forward to hear from our Admission officer maybe he is also still trying to put the puzzle together and see how best he can assist us. We are so sorry for putting the whole team in an awkward position. Thank you.

There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

17/08/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what all you have understood from it.
17/08/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 262 0323: We have understood that that the grant is given to a person who participates fully in all activities and is punctual.At least 75 % attendance.it can not be fully awarded but is distributed though out the yr .cannot be transferred to someone.if one has credit points you cannot use the grant.the grant can be used to pay accommodation for those staying at campus
17/08/23, 3:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 262 0323: We are ma'am
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 262 0323: Am glad to know I am an inspiration to others ma'am
17/08/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Definitely, Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant? <This message was edited>
17/08/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 262 0323: No ma'am am not sure of the reason but I think it's for being consistent in the 21 day challenge
17/08/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 262 0323: Thank you ma'am

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us.
See how diligently your parents have supported you that you have come this far, now this is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this Christmas, give them a sense of financial relief as you have a chance to earn way more than what you have got, so go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. 
What did you think? What are your plans now?
