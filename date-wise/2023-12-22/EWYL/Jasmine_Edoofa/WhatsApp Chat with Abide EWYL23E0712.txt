05/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 277 1362: That will be great

2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

09/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 277 1362: It sounds
09/10/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, what?
09/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 277 1362: Great 😃
09/10/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
09/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 277 1362: 1) SAKUBVA 1 HIGH SCHOOL 

2) Edoofa Scholarship program is a program that assist students around the world especially those from Africa to pursue their education abroad and fulfill their dreams. It looks for legible students who are serious with their education. They offer scholarship percentages from 50-100% basing on the eligibility of the student. Would you like your institution to make collaborations with Edoofa and help your students have a bright future?

3) MANICALAND
09/10/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
09/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 277 1362: Yess l do
09/10/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
09/10/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 277 1362: Yes sure
09/10/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
09/10/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 277 1362: Yes l am ready
09/10/23, 9:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to share some exciting news and a wonderful opportunity that I believe could greatly benefit your students at [School Name].
I have been selected as a recipient of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, which will allow me to pursue higher education in India. This scholarship not only makes quality education accessible but also equips students with essential skills for a successful future in an increasingly competitive world. I firmly believe that your students at [School Name] should have access to similar life-changing opportunities. By offering such opportunities, we can empower them to realize their dreams and provide them with the tools they need to succeed.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
09/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 277 1362: Okay okay
09/10/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's time to conclude our session, and I've truly enjoyed our conversation today.
