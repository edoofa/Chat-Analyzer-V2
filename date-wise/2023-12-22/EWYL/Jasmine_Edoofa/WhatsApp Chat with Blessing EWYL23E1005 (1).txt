It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.*Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.*Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

15/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 087 8756: **3.A student's journey with Edoofa Scholarship program: 
*
A student is required to submit his or her application form for the Edoofa program.This contains for instance, applicant's full name,date of birth and much more.Then they connect with Expert Career counselors for one on one Counselling sessions.For example,my career counselor was Ms Arshita and as per our discussion we concluded that B.com is the most suitable course for me.Parents  are also welcome to join the discussion.Afterwards,the student is required to clear the Eligibility Check Interview with the Edoofa Program Directors and Academic Board members.On clearing the interview,a student receives The Letter of Acceptance.There after, the student then connects with Edoofa 's Admissions team and their SOP prepared and along side they start finalising their University Admission.Furthermore, the students also work hand in hand with the EWYL Mentors to gain skills and earn scholarship credits. Students then start to prepare for travel to India (Visa assistance is provided by the Admissions team). Lastly, proud Edoofians land in India and live their Higher education dream abroad.
16/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 087 8756: 4.One of the student's testimonials: Persistence Muza is one of people who played a major role in my life,as he is the one who made me aware of Edoofa program with the WhatsApp group he created.He is the one l am to write his testimonials in detail."How were you able to earn $3000 scholarship credits" being the first question he was asked.The answer to the question was that he could  not do it without the help of EWYL Mentors ,as they guided him through every step.The  Edoofa team had to call  telling him that if by any chance he happen to face any challenges,he would have to tell them so that they help him .Also Persistence was fully committed,as he worked on EWYL projects everyday doing exactly as he was assigned.Secondly, he was asked about what exactly motivated him to work hard  and to my understanding this guy is really focused.He wants to cover up all the tution fees for the whole 3 years using his scholarship credits.Last but not least,the reaction of his parents was asked.He had to say that his parents were really happy as they were not at first aware that Edoofa could allow him to work on paying for his own education himself.
