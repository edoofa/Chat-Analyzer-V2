29/08/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

This is to remind you that we have our session scheduled for *today at 6:00 PM* here in the EWYL GROUP.

Remember that I have set some goals for you and now it has become my personal agenda to see you achieve that.
*So, let's make the most of the session tomorrow so that we can maximize our impact on our progress*📈

23/11/23, 10:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Tadiwa, this isn't the first instance. You've missed several sessions and calls before, giving the impression that the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and my time are not a priority for you. I've been getting ready for our sessions, particularly to advance in the training for the $300 plan. Unfortunately, due to your absence in the last session, we couldn't kick-start it.

Do you believe this is the right approach, Tadiwa?

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 78886 36775: Will share
26/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 465 9272: l learn the information  i get to let myself try in applying it. .According to Saturday Activity I aspire to be someone who sees opportunity and grab it by the neck.

A habit that i have done and made to envision myself everyday was that i got to think and set clearly my goals of what i call success.I aspire to be the best First Gen Lawyer of my time but i understand i have to be an indispensable asset to this world's knowledge.To achieve that i ought to act,carry,work and present myself differently of I don't want the normal desired outcome of success considered by 95% of today's youth.

In this field of study i understand it might be difficult to breakthrough and make an impact.One thing i am preparing myself for now is to be excellent in problem solving despite the task in my daily life.With this i know just and only one day I can develop and implement effective plans/solutions using my unique abilities.

Talking of obstacles I understand there is sometimes the need for team effort. Acknowledgment of the unknown information is the 1st step to opening up and accepting learning from other persons or sources.I think with this determination i will continue to plow through these hardships. 

As for now students work to have bare minimum in CAs, Mid-terms or End Terms but I myself I don't envision or strive for the same fight.
I only see a top way to greatness to which requires my best effort.

2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that.

09/12/23, 9:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
13/12/23, 1:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us.
See how diligently your parents have supported you that you have come this far, now this is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this Christmas, give them a sense of financial relief as you have a chance to earn way more than what you have got, so go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. 
What did you think? What are your plans now?
21/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 465 9272: It’s a great idea, my plan is to reach out to a minimum of 3 students
