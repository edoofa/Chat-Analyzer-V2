As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

29/08/23, 10:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
Kindly come on the EWYL LINE and type *LESSON*
Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement. So, *_We won't be having sessions on Monday_*

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Wednesday i.e 15 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am*
09/11/23, 10:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

Students are expected to reach out to their personal networks and refer African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools to the Edoofa program. They will receive incentives in the form of scholarship credits for each enrolled student and completed admission formalities. The project emphasizes the importance of identifying opportunities, being enthusiastic, and sharing them openly to make a positive impact. The activities involve creating a list of potential candidates and developing a strategy for outreach and promotion.

4. Project 3: Project 3 involves students reaching out to local senior secondary schools to collaborate with Edoofa, a non-commercial initiative aimed at helping schools. The project focuses on developing networking, communication, and confidence skills, while promoting mindsets of perseverance and community engagement. Students will create a list of schools, connect with decision-makers using LinkedIn, and maintain data in Google Sheets. Incentives include monetary credits for successful interactions and enrollment, as well as scholarship credits. The project aims to provide enduring skills, professional connections, and contribute to the growth of African schools.
