 "Your future is created by what you do today, not tomorrow." - Robert Kiyosaki

*It's time for our session!* Let's dive in, embrace the day, and work together towards your bright future. 🚀
11/10/23, 8:32 am - +265 880 70 64 92: Looking forward to working together with you
11/10/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done Christina,
It clearly shows that you have read the document in detail. Keep it Up!✈️
11/10/23, 8:38 am - +265 880 70 64 92: Thank you Ms Jasmine
11/10/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/10/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 8:39 am - +265 880 70 64 92: Okay
11/10/23, 8:39 am - +265 880 70 64 92: Let me listen to it then
11/10/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure dear
11/10/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Christina?
11/10/23, 8:44 am - +265 880 70 64 92: I am listening to it for the second time as you suggested
11/10/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/10/23, 8:45 am - +265 880 70 64 92: Okay
11/10/23, 9:01 am - +265 880 70 64 92: The purpose of the project is to determine the market which I would like to enter in the future, so as to prepare earlier.
So to begin with I have to identify such companies in my region or other places .And to reach out to  them I may go through my parents, friends as well as those close to my friends who are working in the company. And I will be required to explain how Edoofa is helping me develop necessary skills for future employment after graduation. For further connection I should create a LinkedIn account which allows me to connect with companies through the people who work there. Hence I can connect with with managers and other people with high positions and also I should record their information so as to set up calls with edoofa ,and I should send their characters with edoofa for better connection. For all the task carried out I may gain a lifelong experience and not only that but also credits.
11/10/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Christina. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
11/10/23, 9:04 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 9:33 am - +265 880 70 64 92: Searching for a company as a task also requires looking into the nature of the company. The nature of the company mostly should be based on the student-centric . One must also research on the scale of the company as companies with a moderate number of employees is more suitable. Also the necessary company should be financially stable. Also settle on companies with a strong background.
As such one may search using Google or other platforms upon encountering a suggested company one must start looking into the purpose of the company,and study its website, hence find out if the company is functioning properly. So next is to search the various social media pages as an active company updates more often. Another background to be studied on is about the founder and other members using LinkedIn as it is efficient and note about their past accomplishments.
After such start reaching out to the companies, by sending connection request and invitation notes. And connect firstly with those in higher positions. If these steps are followed orderly one is guaranteed on finding the right companies.
11/10/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You know what Christina, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Wednesday i.e 15 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am*
09/11/23, 10:29 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
