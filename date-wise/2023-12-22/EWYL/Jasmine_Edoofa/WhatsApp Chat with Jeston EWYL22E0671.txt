17/08/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Jeston. I have actually considered that and I have scheduled the session at 6:00 pm (IST).
17/08/23, 9:01 am - +91 82839 19629: Okay thank you 😊

17/08/23, 2:45 pm - +91 82839 19629: How are you
17/08/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
17/08/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you all are good too. First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what all you have understood from it.
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - +91 82839 19629: Well I noted that if I have both the grant and scholarship credits I can only redeem the one which has a higher value only
17/08/23, 2:57 pm - +91 82839 19629: Also I noted that interms of attendance I should maintain a minimum of 75% and I should participate in the ewly lessons so that I can remain visible for the grant
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - +91 82839 19629: The other thing was that the price of the edoofa grant cannot be adjusted
17/08/23, 3:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 3:08 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes ma'am
17/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 3:12 pm - +91 82839 19629: This is great
17/08/23, 3:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 3:22 pm - +91 82839 19629: No
17/08/23, 3:22 pm - +91 82839 19629: I just thought it was because of the challenge
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes and also your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 3:27 pm - +91 82839 19629: Thank you maam 
I appreciate this
17/08/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
17/08/23, 3:52 pm - +91 82839 19629: I will
17/08/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
19/08/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 488 2548: News of the grant received with great pleasure. Feel honoured with the level of dedication he has put thus far and hope it will continue

We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 

The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester* <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 82839 19629: Ohh okay
23/11/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.

23/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 82839 19629: So I won't be able to redeem the 300 for the next semester?
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program - to become job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors & industrial exposure - webinars) plus earning scholarship credits (via working on the projects).
23/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving further, By the end of December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits than the same.

But, it'll only work if you're ready to team up with me daily for the next 30 days. Picture it as a journey where we work side by side, shaping a future that makes you and your parents proud and happy, ultimately securing that grant for you.

27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 82839 19629: Good evening ma'am
27/11/23, 3:02 pm - +91 82839 19629: How are you?
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know were you not aware of the session timings?
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 82839 19629: I was waiting for your message
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Jeston, I can understand but I believe you could have also messaged me.
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Anyways, May I know that do you remember our conversation about Grant?
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 82839 19629: I didn't know I could do that, sorry maam
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes you were talking about how I should increase my attendance to get the grant
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $1200 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now is $123. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
27/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes maam
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 82839 19629: I will do my best
27/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 82839 19629: I believe I have 2 students already who have paid the enrollment fee
27/11/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In which month Jeston?
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 82839 19629: I don't know but i know their names
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - +91 82839 19629: The first one I already told you about him, Talent
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - +91 82839 19629: The other one I believe is Takunda Matya
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will check after the session Jeston
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Shall we continue?
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - +91 82839 19629: Noted
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
27/11/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 82839 19629: Okay I think if we do most of the sessions during the weekend I will be able to cope because now it's end of semester and the pressure is increasing so I want to be able to focus with my studies without straining myself
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Jeston, the calls happen on Saturday. 
Have you attended all the calls?
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 82839 19629: I haven't been able to attend all of them due to some make up classes
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, How many times have you informed me about the same?
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 82839 19629: None
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Correct, So I am ready to corporate but for that you are expected to tell and discuss about the same.
27/11/23, 4:00 pm - +91 82839 19629: Okay
27/11/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 82839 19629: Noted
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 4:14 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself
27/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 82839 19629: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 82839 19629: So ma'am I have a question since I can be eligible for the grant can I use the credits to cover part of the fees
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Right now you are not eligible so at present you can only redeem your credits.
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: If you manage to become eligible for Grant then, you will have a choice in December to chose between the Credits and the Grant.
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - +91 82839 19629: Okay okay so if I get more credits I can use them in case of the grant
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Jeston
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +91 82839 19629: Okay ma'am Shukriya🙏🏾
27/11/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, Jeston, our conversation regarding the grant has concluded.

It was a pleasure discussing this matter with you.
Wishing you a delightful evening, Jeston
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - +91 82839 19629: Same to you

09/12/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 1:24 pm - +91 82839 19629: Good evening ma'am
09/12/23, 1:27 pm - +91 82839 19629: So the challenge I'm facing is that im always busy with school work and you know I'm staying off campus so if I leave school at 5 pm I have to go home and cook and do some Assignments by the time I finish all these things it's probably around 9pm or 10pm so attending the webinars and sessions is quite difficult for me <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 8:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I understand your point, Jeston. However, the webinars occur every two weeks, and the sessions take place once a week. Are you saying that finding time for your own development within this schedule is challenging?
09/12/23, 8:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
13/12/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

*Now, since it's a break, I don't want to stress you out with goals. Instead, I want to know what YOU want to do.* How many applications are you planning to submit when we kick back into gear on January 3rd?

Wishing you the happiest of holidays, filled with joy, relaxation, and moments of warmth. I'll undoubtedly miss our interactions, but I'm eagerly looking forward to reconnecting on January 3rd. 🌲🎁
21/12/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Tick- tock, Tick-tock: What are your plans for Christmas?_* 🕰️

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us.
See how diligently your parents have supported you that you have come this far, now this is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this Christmas, give them a sense of financial relief as you have a chance to earn way more than what you have got, so go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. 
What did you think? What are your plans now?
