Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

05/10/23, 9:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Francine,

05/10/23, 11:16 am - +260 770863622: Hello ma’am 
No I am not
05/10/23, 11:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Since one of your connections named Token Luunzwe filled up the form and shared it directly with us.
05/10/23, 11:58 am - +260 770863622: Oh he called me yes I remember he communicated to me today
05/10/23, 11:58 am - +260 770863622: I thought you meant this one the one I sent to you
05/10/23, 12:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Okay
06/10/23, 12:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Francine
How are you doing?
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - +260 770863622: I am good and you
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - +260 770863622: Ma’am
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - +260 770863622: I wanted to ask about the EWYL program is it just based on the community building project
06/10/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No, There are other projects as well Francine
06/10/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Well other than the ones we know the three you made us aware what else is there
12/10/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it more clear -
*First Week*: Call on Saturday 
*Next Week*: WhatsApp session on Wednesday
*Next Week*: Call on Saturday and so on.

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile. I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
12/10/23, 5:25 pm - +260 770863622: Sure ma’am
12/10/23, 5:25 pm - +260 770863622: Thanks for the update
13/10/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Mark your calendars because it's that time of the week again! Our highly-anticipated *weekly call is right around the corner*, and it's happening *TOMORROW!* 🎉

🗓️ DATE: *14/10/2023, Saturday*
🕒 TIME:  4:30 (Indian Time)
📍 LINK TO THE CALL: https://meet.google.com/oyu-rgsh-igm

📢 A quick reminder: *Your attendance for this month will be marked through these engaging and insightful weekly calls.* 📈 It's a fantastic opportunity to share ideas, stay updated, and build connections with your awesome team. So please, make sure you attend, and let's make this week's call one to remember! 🤝💼

We can't wait to see you there! 👋📞🤗
13/10/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sorry for the delay Francine. So yes, apart from the three core projects, there are also external projects, but these come with specific time limits, and we haven't introduced them yet.

Moreover, when you look at the bigger picture and beyond just earning credits, you'll realize that the basic three projects help you become well-rounded. For instance, with Corporate Alliance, you get the opportunity to reach out to professionals in your industry of interest and build valuable connections. If you make the most of this opportunity, you might not need anyone else's help to secure jobs in the future. Your connections will serve that purpose.
13/10/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, the projects like Community Building and African School Education Reform Mission offer an excellent opportunity to boost your confidence and awaken your leadership qualities. When you engage with 100-200 different people, it naturally enhances your self-assuredness. Furthermore, when you communicate with headmasters, you gain valuable experience in interacting with professionals, which is a crucial skill for your future endeavors.

I am having a problem with my phone it keeps on going off
14/10/23, 6:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you. I am sure that you have understood each and everything clearly. Let me share the points that will help you create the video- 

*You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

08/11/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

23/11/23, 12:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Since we had our session yesterday, I wanted to dedicate the entire time to the session. Now, I am sharing your Lesson of the week today.  Make sure that you go through it and share your understanding by Friday.

23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +260 770863622: Hello
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +260 770863622: Good evening
23/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening, 
I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - +260 770863622: Yes I do ma’am 
I still have the certificate 😌
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:50 pm - +260 770863622: Yes I am
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - +260 770863622: I have understood that the grant is effective in the second semester of each academic year. It is applied if you have 75% attendance for both the university and participation in the EWYL plans and other activities related to edoofa
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - +260 770863622: I agree and appreciate that
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - +260 770863622: True
23/11/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago? 

Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you deserving.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - +260 770863622: Thank you so much and yes I am well aware
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - +260 770863622: I understand
23/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - +260 97 7478618: We noted.Thank you
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
23/11/23, 4:13 pm - +260 770863622: Thank you
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - +260 770863622: I will go through it Ma’am
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.
23/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
23/11/23, 4:25 pm - +260 770863622: But they are not here so does it mean they have to send a copy of there signature or it is okay if the don’t sign
23/11/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: They have to do e-signature
23/11/23, 4:39 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am

25/11/23, 1:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 5:22 pm - +260 770863622: I understood that the power of a competitive spirit is that that pushes us to go beyond our limits, to strive for greatness, and to never settle for mediocrity. When we embrace competition, we tap into our inner strength and determination. It fuels our motivation and drives us to work harder, learn from our failures, and celebrate our victories. A competitive spirit fosters growth, resilience, and a constant desire to improve. So, embrace that competitive fire within you and let it propel you towards success! 
Thank you for the information and this is what I learnt from it

27/11/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh.

Certificates of grand rewards were allocated to the edoofians represent at that meeting
27/11/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter?

Can you recall what they were?

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.

27/11/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago?

28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors.

28/11/23, 3:03 pm - +260 770863622: Yes, I do
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - +260 770863622: Alright
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - +260 770863622: Yes ma’am
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +260 770863622: Sure
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - +260 770863622: Yes I am aware
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
28/11/23, 3:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 

A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
28/11/23, 3:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 770863622: I will ma’am
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - +260 770863622: Yes
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Francine. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $1000 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $2. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - +260 770863622: Sure thing ma’am
28/11/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +260 770863622: Sure ma’am
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - +260 770863622: And ma’am remember that time you said I should connect my former school to edoofa well they are already connected
28/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Sure
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Okay
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 770863622: Njase girls secondary school
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I didn't meant that you have to connect to your former school. 
It was an idea that you can start wokring on the project by reaching out to your former school.
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - +260 770863622: Oh alright
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - +260 770863622: Well I understand that I am supposed to attained the remaining group session and calls.work on allocated tasks and work hard in my EWYL forms
28/11/23, 3:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 4:03 pm - +260 770863622: Sure
28/11/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion.

Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made.

02/12/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Francine, I wanted to reach out to you for a very special opportunity. 

Since you belong to NJASE GIRLS High School we feel that you are the right person to talk to your juniors at the same school.  

We would like to invite you to be the face of Edoofa in front of your schoolmates. As a token of our appreciation for your contribution, we are pleased to offer you a reward of $5 for every enrollment originating from NJASE GIRLS High School through your representation.

We will add you to the school group of NJASE GIRLS High School and there you have to share your experience, how India is different from Africa, and what a student studying there should know what his/her journey will look like. 

May I know if are we on the same page and if are you ready to be added to your school group?
02/12/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: https://meet.google.com/yer-zzec-jkx
Kindly join the call
02/12/23, 4:24 pm - +260 770863622: Good evening ma’am 
I apologize for missing the call it wa not intentional I had class and got home around 5 with a migraine so the tablet I took made me fall asleep whilst waiting for the call
02/12/23, 4:24 pm - +260 770863622: If you have a call with any group you can as well add me up so that I attend it
02/12/23, 4:27 pm - +260 770863622: Isn’t this supposed to work as the hundred dollar plan because me talking to them will be the same as me reaching out to them
02/12/23, 4:35 pm - +260 770863622: The EWYL projects are going not working well for me at the moment, I’ve been trying hard by working on my community building project since it’s one where you get a chance you interact with friends and other people from your community. There are many challenges that I’ve faced in this project such as people not believing that the program is authentic, students taking time to respond to there Counselors and students losing interest because the counselors do not reach out to them in time. I think to improve my results, projects have to be changed or more have to be added because these are too limited and many people are doing the same thing and facing the same problems!
05/12/23, 11:48 am - +260 770863622: Good day ma’am

09/12/23, 7:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 7:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 9:52 am - +260 770863622: Explain this please ?
09/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 770863622: For number three it’s kinda hard to predict because there are some forms I submitted whilst I was in Zambia and all of them told me the edoofa team hadn’t responded to them.  And of late school work has become my priority than finding forms because of the reason I have stated above and it’s just not as easy as it seems to get people interested in edoofa.
09/12/23, 9:55 am - +260 770863622: And which attendance are you talking about I am lost
09/12/23, 11:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good afternoon @260770863622*
I trust you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. 

Our session is about to begin, and I hope you're ready and well-prepared. 
*Kindly confirm your presence quickly so that we can commence with our session.*
09/12/23, 11:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We will discuss all of this in our session today, Francine
09/12/23, 11:58 am - +260 770863622: Hello
09/12/23, 11:58 am - +260 770863622: Sure
09/12/23, 12:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Have you gone through the performance table, Francine? 

Attendance refers to our WhatsApp sessions and Video calls.
09/12/23, 12:05 pm - +260 770863622: I know I miss the video calls but mostly it is due to the timings of the calls
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - +260 770863622: Do you mind sharing the time for the sessions that I missed because of late my responses to the Wednesday wisdoms and Saturday are there but you never seem to respond to them.
09/12/23, 12:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Francine, I'd like you to review the conversation by scrolling down and find the number of sessions, along with their timings, and identify how many sessions you may have missed. I want to assure you that if there are any discrepancies, I will investigate and make necessary adjustments to the performance chart.

It's important to note that the majority of sessions and calls are conducted with an entire group from a specific university. If other students can successfully dedicate 30-40 minutes once a week, I expect all students to participate including you in the calls/sessions.
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I'm aware that there have been instances where I provided the timetable for calls and sessions, and without any prior notice, you missed them.
09/12/23, 12:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The Lessons and Activity responses are recorded but the priority for the grant is the attendance with your respective mentors.
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 770863622: Three webinars in September, with two calls sessions one was about the three hundred dollar plan and the other on the tasks to be done ✔️ for reviews and rating and I had attended a call also where I was on it with a parent when you first shared about the  three hundred dollar plan. And I share all the registrations of the forms for September webinars.  I missed a call on the 14 of October and I had explained to you that my phone has a problem and I attended on webinar. In November on the 23rd I attended a session on the 27th too on the 28th .
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 770863622: I understand
09/12/23, 1:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, So can you write it down that out of 10 sessions, how many have you attended and same for the webinars as well.
09/12/23, 1:18 pm - +260 770863622: I honestly don’t know how to count them so as for now I accept where I stand
09/12/23, 1:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don't worry. 
Give me today's day. I will give you the entire break up of dates and the number of sessions that you have missed.
09/12/23, 1:20 pm - +260 770863622: Sure thing
09/12/23, 1:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now may I know the updates about your project.
09/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 770863622: No updates Ma’am everyone I have talked to is not interested in studying in India
09/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 770863622: Unless other countries
09/12/23, 1:23 pm - +260 770863622: Despite explaining to them the advantages
09/12/23, 1:24 pm - +260 770863622: And in the group for Njase what am I supposed to say to the students
09/12/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Francine, it would be valuable for you to share your personal experience. Being part of the same community, discuss the changes you've observed and convey any insights or advice you have for your juniors. Simply reflect on your journey and offer your perspective to them.
09/12/23, 1:47 pm - +260 770863622: Alright ma’am
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know how are you reaching out to the students?
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - +260 770863622: I am doing it today ma’am
09/12/23, 1:51 pm - +260 770863622: I wanted to confirm on what to convey
09/12/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Do you have the training document with you Francine?
09/12/23, 2:12 pm - +260 770863622: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 2:13 pm - +260 770863622: And I never received a notice to sign the undertaking
09/12/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, because we haven't finished the training yet and I didn't give them the heads up to ask you to sign the undertaking.
09/12/23, 2:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know that have you gone through the document?
09/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 770863622: Okay
09/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 770863622: Yes

Training is a crucial step to ensure that you can derive the maximum benefits from it. Upon completing the training, you will be recognized as a student leader, and you will be responsible for your own application forms.

Does that make sense to you?
09/12/23, 2:15 pm - +260 770863622: Sure
09/12/23, 2:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Excellent, now let's delve into what your specific responsibilities will be as a *STUDENT LEADER* once the training has been completed.

09/12/23, 2:23 pm - +260 770863622: I grasped that from the document, thank you
09/12/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When answering the questions, you can refer to the training document I've provided. Please avoid copying and pasting the same messages.

May I know that are we on the same page?
09/12/23, 2:25 pm - +260 770863622: Yes we are
09/12/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's discuss the essential information that you should convey to the students:

▪️Describe the application process for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

09/12/23, 2:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When answering the questions, you can refer to the training document I've provided. Please avoid copying and pasting the same messages.

May I know that are we on the same page?
09/12/23, 2:29 pm - +260 770863622: I think you mentioned this in one of the calls I attended
09/12/23, 2:29 pm - +260 770863622: Yes
09/12/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Were you able to complete and submit this?
09/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 770863622: Submit what
09/12/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You were told to make 5 questions
09/12/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/12/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will let you know about them again.
09/12/23, 2:40 pm - +260 770863622: I thought the questions in the form are the ones to be used
09/12/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes
09/12/23, 2:44 pm - +260 770863622: Questions like;

1. How much is the enrollment fee?
2. ⁠ what do you understand by the EWYL program?
3. ⁠ How do you use your scholarship credits?
4. ⁠Are your guardians aware of your interest in the Edoofa program?
5. ⁠list some advantages of being an edoofian?
09/12/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: These are quite hard. Think from a perspective of a student who has not yet joined the program.
09/12/23, 2:46 pm - +260 770863622: Isn’t it that by then I would have told them about it all
09/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 770863622: I remember last time you said that when telling someone about edoofa we need to make them know about the enrollment and EWYL program
09/12/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, If you wish you can ask these questions but I would suggest you to ask some easy once like, is it a fully funded or a partially funded program.
09/12/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Which country will you go?
09/12/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I agree

09/12/23, 2:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Francine, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

13/12/23, 1:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

I trust you've had the chance to review my earlier messages and that you've made good use of your weekend. 
Without further ado, I kindly request you to share the application with me now

_*Oh, what fun it is to ride. In a one-horse open sleigh!*_  

As we stand on the threshold of the much-anticipated festive season, and considering that some of you have exams going on. After careful consideration, *I'm thrilled to share some exciting news with you!*
19/12/23, 3:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It's holiday time! 🎉 So, here's the scoop: no sessions, no lessons, no calls, and no activities *until January 5th, 2024*. 
Yes, a full-on break!

If you ever want to connect with me during the break, just drop me a message in our EWYL GROUP between 6-8 pm. If I need to share any updates during the break, I'll be reaching out every alternate day during this time. So, make sure you're around and ready to catch up on those days.

*Now, since it's a break, I don't want to stress you out with goals. Instead, I want to know what YOU want to do.* How many applications are you planning to submit when we kick back into gear on January 6th?

Wishing you the happiest of holidays, filled with joy, relaxation, and moments of warmth. I'll undoubtedly miss our interactions, but I'm eagerly looking forward to reconnecting on January 6th. 🌲🎁
21/12/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Tick- tock, Tick-tock: What are your plans for Christmas?_* 🕰️

Well, 2023 must have been a roller coaster for you, hasn't it? After all, you came to India, leaving your parents, and began an incredible new journey here with us.
See how diligently your parents have supported you that you have come this far, now this is the time to give them what they truly deserve. So, this Christmas, give them a sense of financial relief as you have a chance to earn way more than what you have got, so go on and work hard to earn more scholarship credits. 
What did you think? What are your plans now?
