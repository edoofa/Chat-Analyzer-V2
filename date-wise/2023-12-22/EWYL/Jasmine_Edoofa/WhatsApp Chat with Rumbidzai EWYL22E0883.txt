There are different types of platforms that I can use for exay Google , social media bases ( Facebook or instragram ).

04/09/23, 3:16 pm - +91 78273 08969: That is all for today, Let us continue tomorrow.

04/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Same to you
05/09/23, 1:27 pm - +91 78273 08969: Good Afternoon!
How are you today?
It is time for your session.
05/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Afternoon Mem
05/09/23, 1:50 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
05/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
05/09/23, 1:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
05/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Noted
05/09/23, 1:57 pm - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
05/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
05/09/23, 2:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
05/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
05/09/23, 2:20 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
05/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
05/09/23, 2:31 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
05/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay I understand
05/09/23, 2:36 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
05/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
05/09/23, 2:41 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>

05/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
05/09/23, 2:47 pm - +91 78273 08969: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
05/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Alright
05/09/23, 3:13 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

05/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
05/09/23, 3:17 pm - +91 78273 08969: After this, You can interact with students by asking if they have any queries so far or not. Once all the queries have been dealt with, It is now time that we share the Student Application Form with the students and ask them to share it in the group.
Feel free to take my help if you have any doubts regarding the queries that you might get from the students.

Please note a few things:
FIRST- You will have your sessions on Monday and Thursday from 12:00 pm to 1:30 pm.
11/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
11/09/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
11/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Alright
11/09/23, 2:24 pm - +91 78273 08969: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line
11/09/23, 2:24 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa EWYL.vcf (file attached)
11/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okah
11/09/23, 2:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/09/23, 1:43 pm - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
12/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay
12/09/23, 1:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
12/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Understood
12/09/23, 2:05 pm - +91 78273 08969: I hope you have received the Newsletter, From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discussed and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.
Great day to you.
12/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 033 2039: Okay and thank you
