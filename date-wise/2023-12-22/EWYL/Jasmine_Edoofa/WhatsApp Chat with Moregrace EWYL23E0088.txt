01/09/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
Thank you for letting me know
15/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 6:49 am - +263 77 210 6217: Yaa as a father i can do the session between 1:30pm and 2:30pm on all stipulated dates. For saturdays i think you may do it with Moregrace. Thanks for your understanding
16/09/23, 8:02 am - +263 71 562 7442: Can you add this number Moregrace will be using this number +263781556299 to do lessons until we notify you that she is using her Fon again ,,, maybe that would be after exams
16/09/23, 8:14 am - +263 71 562 7442: For today and the coming days Moregrace will be using this one

19/09/23, 11:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Afternoon ma'am. I'm very sorry for responding late. I had a network issue
19/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 155 6299: I'm ready for the session
20/09/23, 1:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Greetings!*
I hope you are doing well. This is to remind you that you have your session today from 1:30 pm onwards. So, are you ready?
20/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes I'm ready
20/09/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
20/09/23, 1:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Yes i did.
20/09/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Moregrace is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach her professional goals.
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
20/09/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
20/09/23, 2:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
20/09/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now it is time to wrap up for today. 
It was lovely talking to you.
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Same here. It was really e
21/09/23, 4:24 am - +263 78 155 6299: Sorry typing error. Wanted to say thank you for your time
05/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Afternoon. Lets move on. As for my doccuments will send them latest tomorrow  afternoon
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Last time I was introducing you to the team. Do you remember?
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Yaa sure i remember. Thanks a lot
05/10/23, 2:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Nice to hear that . Greetings to both of them
05/10/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Moregrace to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
05/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 210 6217: I understand. May you please send me a link of this group so that moregrace will be able to connect with u. She is not on the group right now she experienced a challenge with her gadget
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Sure, Here is the link
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: https://chat.whatsapp.com/JQRvUeYfaA259zdkhhryUS
05/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Thanks so much
05/10/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once Moregrace forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
05/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Its so nice to hear that good news. You may send the the News letters
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up for today. We will definitely connect tomorrow at 2:00 pm. 
Have a great day!
05/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Have a nice day to you as well
06/10/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
May I know that are you available for the session now?
06/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 155 6299: Afternoon ma'am

06/10/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Moregrace’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
06/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 155 6299: That's great
06/10/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
Have a lovely day ahead!

13/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Fine am ready
13/10/23, 2:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
13/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Fine will do that
13/10/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
13/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Very clear Ma-am. Thanks a lot
16/10/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Moregrace and Parents* @263715627442 @263781556299 @263716558774 @263772106217 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
16/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 210 6217: Yes am available

16/10/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Alright, may I inquire if you'd like to temporarily pause her sessions until she completes her exams and she can resume once she has completed her exams.
16/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 562 7442: Ok we can proceed
16/10/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Moregrace to me stating that:

You know, while I was traveling to the office today, I thought that we were already late to begin our EWYL journey and work on the project, as you were occupied with your exams. So, I was thinking of connecting daily here in your EWYL group.

This way, I can ensure proper guidance and an effective path to work on your project, maximizing scholarship credits. *Therefore, from now on, let us connect at 8:30 am in the morning in your EWYL group to proceed with your EWYL journey*!

Make sure you come on time.
06/12/23, 8:23 am - +263 78 155 6299: Morning ma'am. You said the Edoofa team work tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. These objectives are a)Ensure that all Edoofians have ab equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers.  b) The second objectives is to help all Edoofians self-finance their education and to encourage them to work hard making sure they earn maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. You then introduced me to the EWYL team in which there is Ms.Sanjana who is the Head of the department and all group conversations.  There is also Ms.Davi who's the Head coach. You also informed me about the program structure and also about the newsletters which are weekly send by the founder of Edoofa Mr Angad Singh. You then informed me about the three major projects to learn and earn as many scholarships credits as possible.
06/12/23, 8:27 am - +263 78 155 6299: Ok Ma'am
06/12/23, 8:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
06/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 155 6299: Yes ma'am
06/12/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I want you to take some time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
06/12/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
06/12/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 155 6299: In the document there are 3 most rewarding projects. The first one is called Corporate Alliances:  this is when Edoofians represents Edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employees. This helps them to create a strong professional network and earn scholarship credits.  The 2nd one is called Community Building: this is when students will reach out to their personal and extended networks and offer them an opportunity to be a part of Edoofa's educational ecosystem and aquire International education which prepares them for the future. There more you get students enrolled the more credits you get. The 3rd one is called African Schools Education Reform Mission:  this is where students reach out to local schools in their local region and will speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa.  If the school agrees and students get enrolled in Edoofa that's when one gets credits. These projects are divided into activities so as to successfully complete the entire project
06/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done Moregrace,
It clearly shows that you have read the document in detail. Keep it Up!✈️
06/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
06/12/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 155 6299: Ok Ma'am

06/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 155 6299: Corporate alliance:you should connect with companies  that are technically driven .you should identify all your relatives and neighbours who work in these companies and tell them about my objectives and  tell them how I was enrolled in edoofa, my objectives  and how edoofa is helping me. One then creates a LinkedIn account where you look for companies and their employees
06/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 155 6299: The task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to extend their help in the development of all the students that enrol for the Edoofa  programme. This companies should be either be student centric or recreational or could be content centric platforms. The scale of the company should not be to big or too small . These companies should be financially sound and the Founder's background should be strong in terms experience and qualifications .
06/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 155 6299: There are some steps taken so as to get a good company which are. Step 1  searching 
Step2. Studying a little more about the company and its functioning 
Step3 study the website of the company 
Step4 check various social media of the company 
Step5  study the background of the Founder and other core members
Step 6 start reaching out to them by dropping an invitation note and sending  a connecting request
06/12/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Moregrace. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

Do you remember?

15/12/23, 8:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
15/12/23, 8:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Do you remember?
20/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 155 6299: Yes I do
20/12/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: And #2  The *Scholarship Credits* earning opportunity for this project!

1. On every successful call/ email Response by the school to Team Edoofa- you will be awarded $2
2. Once the group or the process begins- you will be awarded $10 worth of scholarship credits
3. Surprise!! An Additional Opportunity to earn $25 worth of Scholarship Credits when 5 students complete their enrollment from one particular school!
20/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 155 6299: Ok ok
20/12/23, 9:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
20/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 155 6299: 1 Gutu high school. Yes it is connected with Edoofa 

2. I will introduce myself and share how I got the scholarship (which I got through the the African Schools Education Reform Mission programme). After thus I then share details about Edoofa and ask them if I can schedule a call with the Edoofa program director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.

3. Gutu high school is located in Masvingo province
20/12/23, 9:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
20/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 155 6299: Yes
20/12/23, 9:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
20/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
20/12/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
20/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
20/12/23, 9:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
20/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
20/12/23, 9:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Now it is time to wrap up the session*. It was lovely talking to you. _As homework, I would want you to go on this post and drop a comment on where you see yourself in the next 5 years and how the EWYL Program and your mentor that is me will help you do that._
