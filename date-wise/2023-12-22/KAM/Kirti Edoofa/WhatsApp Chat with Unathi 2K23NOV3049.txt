Well l have been working on  being confident. I'm very detail-oriented, and I love to learn new things, but sometimes I get a little too caught up in the details and lose sight of the big picture. We are a family of four ..l have a young sister ,my mom and dad..well my parents and  l  belong to the middle class l mustn't say we are neither rich nor poor
My mom is a domestic worker in South Africa and my dad is a security guard in South Africa

It's wonderful to learn about your passion for netball and your commendable skills in problem-solving and teamwork at just 18 years old. Your family, which includes your parents, you, and your younger sister who is in grade 8 in South Africa, appears to be a tightly-knit and supportive group. As you anticipate your higher education journey abroad, it's heartening to know that you have the support of your parents, which is an invaluable asset in this endeavor.
18/12/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention.

20/12/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/12/23, 1:12 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes sure ma'am
20/12/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:22 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes I'm done
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/12/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/12/23, 1:27 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/12/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/12/23, 1:38 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/12/23, 1:39 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes sure ma'am
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually?
20/12/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
20/12/23, 1:41 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes sure
20/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

Also the Edoofa had invested a lot of time to identify good schools, colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians <This message was edited>

21/12/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the 4th video, I shall wait for your response to the remaining videos.
21/12/23, 2:24 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Here they are ma'am
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
21/12/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
21/12/23, 2:28 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Okay ma'am all understood
21/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
21/12/23, 2:31 pm - +27 63 826 9733: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:30 PM.
21/12/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.
