08/08/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. I recently had a conversation with Ms. Arshita, and she did brief me about Tashinga's academic background and career aspirations. I must say, as a family, you must be proud of him and must be working towards providing him with the best opportunities to kick-start his career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
08/08/23, 8:29 pm - +27 79 803 5710: The counseling session was very helpful and eye opening. We did appreciate the fact that the Edoofa Scholarship program is a hands-on programme, that does not only help my child get the best possible and affordable education, but also gain experience doing so through the Earn while you Learn program.
08/08/23, 8:29 pm - +27 73 199 8986: We do take pride in him and we are grateful for the opportunity that Edoofa is offering him to further his career aspirations. What we liked about Edoofa is that it is like a home away from home. Even though it will be far from home the welcome and care given to students during their stay is heart warming as evidenced in the videos and pictures that we have had access to. Moreover, it makes Tashinga employable after his studies as he will have practical experience through the EWYL program which also assists in taking care of his financial side of the studies.
08/08/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you had such a great experience, indeed it is a home far away form home and I am glad to know that you have a great understanding of the EWYL program and absolutely through EWYL students get to learn more about 21st-century skills that are necessary for today's world to be employable.

14/08/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records. 

Now that we are done with the feedback forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
14/08/23, 7:32 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I am available, and yes please help me understand
14/08/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/08/23, 7:33 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes please
14/08/23, 7:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/08/23, 7:37 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I've read and taken note of the stages
14/08/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/08/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/08/23, 7:41 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes ,we are clear
14/08/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/08/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/08/23, 7:45 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes , I am following
14/08/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/08/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/08/23, 7:48 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Crystal clear
14/08/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/08/23, 7:50 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes ,we shall
14/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
14/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
14/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

14/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
14/08/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
14/08/23, 8:05 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I have a test to prepare for  Tomorrow,so is it fine if we schedule our lesson for tomorrow at 08:00 pm
14/08/23, 8:07 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Sorry I mean session
14/08/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since tomorrow is a National holiday here in India, we will not be able to connect with you tomorrow so can I anticipate you will be able to go through the videos by Wednesday at 01.00 pm?
14/08/23, 8:12 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Wednesday would be great , however I'll only be available after 04:00 pm because I'll be at school,so is it fine if we connect at 04:00 instead of 01:00
14/08/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, we shall connect at 09.00 pm on Wednesday. I hope you will be available.
14/08/23, 8:15 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes ,I will be available
14/08/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, have a blessed night.
16/08/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tashinga.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
16/08/23, 8:46 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good evening Mrs Kiriti. I'm doing well, thank you, I hope you're doing well too.

Yes I managed to go through the videos
16/08/23, 8:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing well too and I am glad to know that you are doing well. That is good to know that you were able to go through all the videos, so could you please share your understanding of the videos with us?
16/08/23, 9:00 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I understood that Edoofa is not a new organization and has been helping underprivileged children for a long time to pursue their dreams. I aslo understood that as an Edoofian there's need to follow instructions and listen to experts.In addition,I learnt that Edoofas purpose is for students to gain experience while they study.
16/08/23, 9:12 pm - +27 73 743 6250: To add on I learnt that as an Edoofian there's need to be open minded. lastly I learnt about the Statement of purpose whereby Edoofa contacts multiple schools, colleges and universities to convince them why a student is worth of admissions or scholarship.Therefore I believe Edoofa is of great assistance.
16/08/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
16/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
16/08/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
16/08/23, 9:18 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I agree with your more elaborate responses
16/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
16/08/23, 9:26 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank you
16/08/23, 9:26 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Noted
16/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
16/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

As a forensic scientist I would carefully collect evidence to ensure accuracy and maintain its integrity so I would begin by documenting the scene through photos, sketches, and notes. Then I would prioritize safety by securing the area to prevent contamination. Then gather physical evidence using sterile tools like gloves, tweezers, and evidence bags. To avoid cross-contamination, each item would be collected separately and labeled. For  biological samples like blood or hair I would carefully package them to preserve their viability. Trace evidence such as fibers or gunshot residue would be collected using adhesive tape or vacuuming. Additionally I would maintain chain of custody documentation in order to track evidence movement.

During collection, as a forensic scientist I would stick to established protocols, understanding the significance of preventing contamination and preserving evidence's context. My expertise would be to ensure that evidence is handled properly, guaranteeing its admissibility in court and contributing to the accurate resolution of investigations.
17/08/23, 10:06 pm - +27 73 743 6250: 3. Bloodstain pattern analysis is a forensic technique that scrutinizes the complicated patterns created by blood when it's deposited on surfaces. By evaluating the size, shape,distribution, and arrangement of these stains, experts aim to work out the dynamics of a crime scene. The analysis helps deduce vital information like the angle and speed of impact, the origin of the bloodshed, and the sequence of events. This approach aids investigators in constructing credible scenarios, confirming or challenging witness testimonies, and establishing timelines. It proves especially beneficial in cases of violent crimes, accidents, or mysterious deaths. However, it's important to recognize the potential for subjectivity and the need for factual confirmation in interpreting patterns. Bloodstain pattern analysis demands a blend of scientific understanding, analytical awareness, and careful observation, contributing significantly to the area of forensic science and its role in the legal system.
17/08/23, 10:10 pm - +27 73 743 6250: 4. As a forensic scientist I would choose to work at crime scenes due to the unique challenges and immediate impact of their contributions. The crime scene environment offers a dynamic and unrepeatable opportunity to directly observe evidence in its original context. This hands-on experience allows me to better understand the case, potentially leading to insights that might be missed in a laboratory setting. Being on-site enables me to interact with law enforcement, gather information first-hand, and make real-time decisions about evidence collection and preservation.

Crime scene work also demands a varying skill set, including attention to detail, critical thinking, and adaptability. The thrill of solving complex puzzles and the satisfaction of helping uncover crucial evidence can be deeply rewarding. Additionally, being at the crime scene can provide a sense of closure and justice, as I would be playing a direct role in bringing clarity to the circumstances of a crime.

Ultimately, working at a crime scene offers me a chance to make immediate contributions to solving cases, teaming up closely with other professionals, and experiencing the fast-paced, challenging, and meaningful aspects of the field.
17/08/23, 10:12 pm - +27 73 743 6250: 5. To always stay updated in forensic science I would be proactive by subscribing to peer-reviewed journals, attending conferences, and joining professional organizations like the American Academy of Forensic Sciences which offer access to the latest research and trends. Moreover, I would engage in online forums, webinars, and workshops hosted by reputable institutions and industry experts as they provide insights into emerging technologies.

Additionally, I would make use of social media to follow forensic science accounts, academic institutions, and relevant professionals for real-time updates. Collaborating with colleagues, participating in case discussions, and seeking mentorship would also foster knowledge exchange. Furthermore, online platforms would also be useful like edX offers courses on forensic science advancements.

Additionally, I would read books and publications authored by respected experts in order to enhance my understanding. Another thing I would do is to regularly check government agency websites and industry news sources, such as Forensic Magazine, to keep me informed about breakthroughs. Lastly, staying curious and adaptable is key, as the field continually evolves with technological innovations and new methodologies.
17/08/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
17/08/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
17/08/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
17/08/23, 10:20 pm - +27 73 199 8986: This is Tashinga, I'm using my mother's phone because mine is acting up
Yes I do want to pursue a bachelor's degree in forensic science in India
17/08/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, that is alright, may I know if you were able to go through the year of intake that is mentioned in the above message as well?
17/08/23, 10:21 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Yes It's correct
17/08/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
17/08/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
17/08/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
17/08/23, 10:24 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Yes
17/08/23, 10:25 pm - +27 73 199 8986: It would be impossible I'd have to study at one
17/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
17/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
17/08/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
17/08/23, 10:28 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Yes my counselor did
17/08/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
17/08/23, 10:30 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Well understood
17/08/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
17/08/23, 10:31 pm - +27 73 199 8986: It's Crystal clear
17/08/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
17/08/23, 10:35 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Yes I'm following
17/08/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
17/08/23, 10:38 pm - +27 73 199 8986: How long does it take for me to receive offer letters from Universities?
17/08/23, 10:38 pm - +27 73 199 8986: On the financial side I have no queries,I understand completely
17/08/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, let me help you understand, the universities would be able to generate the offer letter within a week's time.
17/08/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.
17/08/23, 10:40 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Okay thank you, now I understand
17/08/23, 10:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
17/08/23, 10:45 pm - +27 73 199 8986: I will notify my parents and I am ready to begin the EWYL program but my responses will unfortunately not be prompt as I'm still going to school and about to write preliminary exams. However I'll try my level best
17/08/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, I understand, and you can share the same with your EWYL Mentor tomorrow once we share the EWYL Group link,  so they will schedule the sessions accordingly, I hope we are clear here?
17/08/23, 10:47 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Yes we are thank you
17/08/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, have a great night, and convey my regards to your family as well.
17/08/23, 10:48 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Thank you very much,good night you as well
17/08/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, and thank you.

18/08/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright. Please do let me know once you have joined the EWYL group and are connected with your EWYL mentor.
19/08/23, 4:33 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms Jasmine
08/09/23, 2:53 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
09/09/23, 9:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Tashinga,

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Tashinga's higher education?
09/09/23, 10:21 am - +27 73 199 8986: Morning, we are fine thank you and yourself? Pleased to hear of that it is time to proceed with the admission process. We have been preparing for his higher education by supporting him to get good results in his current schooling as he is busy now with the trial examinations. Moreover, we have been supporting him to improve his profile through allowing him to know more about Edoofa, India as a whole and also universities in India. We have also managed to put together some finances which we have paid for the application fee which we have just recently paid in full.
13/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tashinga.

I hope you are doing well, Kindly excuse me for the delay in response. As we were occupied with the arrivals and now as we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians.

Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.
13/09/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 5:35 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Afternoon Ms Kirti, we are doing great thank you. We also hope that you are well. We understand that you were busy. It is very evident in the photo that the Edoofians are happy and are ready for their new academic year. Moreover we are glad to know that the focus is not only on academics but every aspect that ensures the students personal growth.
17/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tashinga.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
17/09/23, 10:10 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Noted mam. We pray that you be well. We understand stand and we will commit to connect at the time specified.
02/10/23, 2:31 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good afternoon Mrs kirti I just wanted to inquire about my sessions if they are still continuing because I haven't hurd from any of the groups
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tashinga.

I hope you are doing well, yes please, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as I was a little under the weather, which was followed by a long weekend and a national holiday on Monday, which was *Gandhi Jayanti*. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on *October 2nd* to commemorate the birthday of *Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi*, commonly known as *Mahatma Gandhi.* He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a strong believer in Nonviolence, which helped India to active Political and Social changes.
03/10/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the long weekend and the national holiday, it was impossible for us to connect with you during that period. However, we are available now. May I kindly inquire if you are currently available?
03/10/23, 3:23 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good afternoon Mrs kirti,yes I am available

03/10/23, 3:56 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Unfortunately we are on holiday meaning schools are closed therefore I'll only get it next week when we open schools on the 10th of October
03/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, in that case, let us move ahead with our discussion and keep the document on hold. So may I know if you are ready to start?
03/10/23, 4:20 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I am ready to begin
03/10/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

03/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 4:45 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Step 1. The watching of videos aimed to provide clarity to about becoming an Edoofian, understanding Edoofian qualities, aligning with Edoofa's vision, learning about affiliated educational institutions, and emphasizing the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
03/10/23, 4:49 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Step 2: Preparation of the SOP to convince admissions board ,worthiness of scholarship and school admission
03/10/23, 4:53 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Step 3: Counseling from Edoofa academic board showing their experience on achieving success academically and achievement of maximum scholarship as well as life in India .
03/10/23, 5:03 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Step 4: Edoofa's admission team sends application to different universities
03/10/23, 5:04 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Step 5: Receipt of letter of intent,then registration.
03/10/23, 5:05 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Step 6: Visa process with assistance from admission team
03/10/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
03/10/23, 7:21 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank you, I would like to verify the stage I am currently on, it is stage 3 right?
03/10/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27737436250 we have completed stage 3 and now we move ahead with stage 4, so may I know if you are ready to start?
03/10/23, 7:25 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I am ready,thank you
03/10/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
03/10/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
03/10/23, 7:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
03/10/23, 7:39 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Thank you for the information and I am extremely excited to move on to the next step
03/10/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
03/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
03/10/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
03/10/23, 7:53 pm - +27 73 743 6250: I have reviewed the benefits
03/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
03/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
03/10/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tashinga, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
03/10/23, 8:22 pm - +27 73 743 6250: This is absolutely amazing
03/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
03/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
03/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
03/10/23, 8:33 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes the explanation does resonate with me
03/10/23, 8:37 pm - +27 73 743 6250: This means I will benefit as my fees will not be high as other students and it will lighten my parents financial burden
03/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes you are absolutely correct. 

3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
03/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
03/10/23, 8:49 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I understand that my registration fee will be reduced which is one of my privileges
03/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
03/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
03/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
03/10/23, 9:20 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Good evening mam, it's Tashinga's mother and have been following the conversation. We fully understand the explanation you have given us. Thank you so much for being so informative
03/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @27731998986 I am glad to know that you have been following along and have understood everything really well.
03/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear here?
03/10/23, 9:24 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Yes I am, if I may get clarity when approximately should we make sure we have the initial payment available with us, just an estimated range of time
03/10/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 15 days of receiving the offer letter will be your first deadline, for example, if you receive your offer letter on the 5th of October after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 20, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 20, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
03/10/23, 9:44 pm - +27 73 199 8986: This is well understood mam but wanted to get clarity on when we might receive the offer letter. Can we get it within the next few days or you are awaiting some documents that you requested?
03/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the university is able to generate the letter within 3-5 days of time, however, since we do not have the end-term result or the letter of Recommendation for Tashinga, the letter would take time, since Tashinga mentioned that both of the documents will be available after a week's time, however, if you will be able to share the documents before or by the 10th of October 2023, then you will be able to receive the offer letter by the 15th of October and also use the Endowment plan as well.
03/10/23, 9:54 pm - +27 73 199 8986: This is crystal clear. Thank you for the clarification. We try to get the letter as soon as schools reopen.
03/10/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, could you please clarify for me when Tashinga be writing the final exams for grade 12?
03/10/23, 10:01 pm - +27 73 199 8986: He begins his final matric examinations on the 30th of October 2023
03/10/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. I am happy to let you know that for Tashinga we have 3 more additional benefits. 

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
03/10/23, 10:15 pm - +27 73 199 8986: This is well understood but would want clarification on how 2 A level passes  translates to using the matric exams that Tashinga will write
03/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the 2 A level passes are equivalent to 45% passing marks in grade 12 now Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
03/10/23, 10:20 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Would like you to furnish us with the details of the process that will be used to assess
03/10/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
03/10/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels/ 45% passing marks in grade 12.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
03/10/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
03/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
03/10/23, 10:26 pm - +27 73 199 8986: This is well understood mam, thank you very much for the clarity.
03/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades)/ 45% passing marks in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right? <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 10:29 pm - +27 73 199 8986: My worry now is the report for the previous term as Tashinga is likely to get in during the second week after opening which will probably be around the 16th
03/10/23, 10:30 pm - +27 73 199 8986: This is right, unless they rewrite to upgrade their results
03/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand in that case, I would suggest you try to talk to the school and see if they can share any picture of the result, or if you can access it online?
03/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/10/23, 10:32 pm - +27 73 199 8986: We will have to try to do this and get back to you on this
03/10/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, you can update me tomorrow regarding the same.
03/10/23, 10:34 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Yes and I think option 2 makes more sense but option 3 is what I would say is not an option at all
03/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
03/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
03/10/23, 10:35 pm - +27 73 199 8986: It will have to be after the 10th as schools are closed at the moment and will not be able to contact anyone untill opening day
03/10/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that is alright you can update me regarding the same on the 10th of October 2023.
03/10/23, 10:37 pm - +27 73 199 8986: This is clear, however there is an option to write supplementary examinations in June and the resuycomw out in August- September thereabout, does it mean the prospective student has to wait for 2025 too?
03/10/23, 10:38 pm - +27 73 199 8986: We will surely do that
05/10/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tashinga.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 6:48 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Good evening Ms.Kirti,yes we are available to connect
05/10/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now coming back to your query In that case, we do have another benefit, let me help you understand further.

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 7:07 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I am clear
05/10/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 7:14 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Ohh so even if I don't finish the course I can still benefit?
05/10/23, 7:23 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Good evening mam, sorry for joining late but I also fully understand all that you have explained so far
05/10/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, that is correct. That is alright @27731998986
05/10/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 7:31 pm - +27 73 199 8986: We understand and are trying to make sure we have the initial payment of around $300 as soon as you get the outstanding documentation and then be able to finish it up within the required time frame since we struggle financially. Is there a possibility of any other payment arrangements?
05/10/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have understood everything, for now this is all required @27731998986
05/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Tashinga's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Tashinga is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 7:43 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Very excited mam and am hoping that Tashinga will be one of the fortunate ones to benefit from the endowment
05/10/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter after you share the last academic documents, so for now your offer letter will be pending from the university. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 7:52 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Thank you so much Ms Kirti for such a positive and informative conversation. May you enjoy the rest of your day too.
05/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you so much and you are most welcome. Let us reconnect on 10th of October 2023, regarding the document update.
05/10/23, 8:08 pm - +27 73 199 8986: We will surely do that mam
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright have a great night.
05/10/23, 8:09 pm - +27 73 199 8986: Thank you, be blessed.

10/10/23, 8:26 pm - +27 73 743 6250: As promised I managed to get my report today
10/10/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tashinga.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter.

I hope this message finds you well. I have received feedback from the admissions team regarding the documents you provided for Tashinga. During their evaluation process before sharing the application with the universities, the team noticed that the letter of Recommendation from the school or the statement of entry for the grade 12 exams would benefit Tashinga's application. I am reaching out to you as it is our responsibility to inform you about the same, so could you please let me know by when will you be able to collect the letter of recommendation from the school as well, or the statement of entry for the grade 12 exams?

21/12/23, 6:06 pm - +27 73 199 8986: 1. $900
2. 3years (6 semesters)
3.$300. NB- don't quite understand where it says wavered off under early registrations
4.$750
21/12/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
21/12/23, 6:10 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Yes mam. Quite clear.
21/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
21/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
21/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
21/12/23, 6:14 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Sorry mam to take you back... On the admission and procedure fee. Can you please explain that one for us as well as the registration
21/12/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand however, @27798035710 as we move ahead we will be discussing the same in detail so you do not have to worry about it.
21/12/23, 6:27 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Understood mam. Also understood clearly the accommodation options available 🙏
21/12/23, 6:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
21/12/23, 6:30 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Sure mam it does. So it means the choice can only be made upon arrival at the university?
21/12/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are absolutely correct.
21/12/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/12/23, 6:32 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Yes we are clear mam
21/12/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/12/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 6:35 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Yes mam. We are together mam. Now very clear
21/12/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 6:38 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Yes please mam.
21/12/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 3 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 3, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $660 within 15 working days, before January 3, 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 6:41 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Well understood mam, everything is crystal clear
21/12/23, 6:51 pm - +27 79 803 5710: So which means we will have to choose how to pay the registration fees from the above alternatives.
21/12/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, you can choose between the two options. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

You can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mama Money for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option.
21/12/23, 7:05 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Noted mam. We can carry on
21/12/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/12/23, 7:06 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Very clear and noted
21/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/12/23, 7:16 pm - +27 73 743 6250: Yes I understand this very well
21/12/23, 7:16 pm - +27 79 803 5710: We do understand mam. That is wonderful 🙌
21/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/12/23, 7:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/12/23, 7:28 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Yes mam. This would really go a long way in alleviating our tuition burden. It is an excellent programme that is worth encouraging our son to commit to.
21/12/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that he will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
21/12/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 7:32 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Great mam. We wish to enquire if this is the only university we should consider.
21/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
21/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
21/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
21/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
21/12/23, 7:39 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Yes we do mam, however what happens in the event that other universities later respond while we have already paid the admission fee for this first one looking at the time limit of payment.
21/12/23, 7:41 pm - +27 79 803 5710: To add on mam. Since there is the issue of merit. What happens after Tashinga's Matric results come out. Do we upload them as well for consideration
21/12/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your queries one by one.
21/12/23, 7:48 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Noted mam
21/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
21/12/23, 7:49 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Can you please explain
21/12/23, 7:51 pm - +27 79 803 5710: I mean the transfer option
21/12/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
21/12/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
21/12/23, 7:53 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Thank you so so much. That is very good. We get you now
21/12/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that your first query is now cleared coming to your second concern. if you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. We will inquire about the results and ask them from you and share with the university again. 

May I know if you are clear?
21/12/23, 7:55 pm - +27 79 803 5710: Perfect mam. Thank you for your clear and professional explanation.
21/12/23, 7:56 pm - +27 79 803 5710: It is now so clear and we are so excited.
21/12/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I am happy to hear that you have understood well. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
21/12/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

21/12/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise.

We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
