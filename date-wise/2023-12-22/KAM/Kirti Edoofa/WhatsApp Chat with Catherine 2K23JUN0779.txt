09/09/23, 9:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Catherine,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Catherine's higher education?
12/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Hello Ms Kirti and the Admin 
Im sorry to tell you that Catherine is now winding up her Studies in preparation for her final high school examinations and she won't be available up until the 16th of November when she finishes.
Until then im available to answer to what beyond my knowledge.

As for  Her Higher Education yes we are planning towards that day in day out.
17/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Catherine.

24/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Good afternoon ma'am I have read the above and understood
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
24/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Sorry ma'am we did not have network but tommorow we will be available
25/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, with regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to continue with our discussion ahead may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am I am
25/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
25/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am everything is clear
25/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
25/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am I have read and understood
25/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 318 4079: This is a nice scheme for paying I am following up thank you
25/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 318 4079: No ma'am please provide
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok maam I understand
25/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end a little early today as it is the weekend. Let's reconnect on Monday and continue this session. Have a great weekend, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
25/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Same to you ma'am and thank you for the time have a blessed weekend
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes maam i am available
28/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
28/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am we are
28/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes I agree
28/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, since it was my dinner break and since we will not be available to continue with our discussion let us reconnect tomorrow during the day time which is at 12:30 pm. Have a great evening ahead.
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok maam
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 318 4079: Morning ma'am because of Network I was unable to connect but things are ok now we may continue
01/12/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright please I understand that network can be a challenge, however, if you are available now we can connect and move ahead with our discussion.
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Sorry ma'am I was traveling but I am stable now
01/12/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that completely may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/12/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok ma'am I understand
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
01/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok that is good
01/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/12/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Sorry ma'am Network is tripping
15/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 71 318 4079: But I did not understand on the issue of money which has to be paid in 15 days time is it $300 or $750
15/12/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Good Evening Ms Kirti,our network is bad  but would you please elaborate to me on the Tuition fees structure  especially on $1800 and also $900.
15/12/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that network can be a challenge. I completely understand your concern here. However, the majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/12/23, 6:58 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok maam
15/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/12/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Yes Ma'am sure
15/12/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the questions I inquired above,
15/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 303 1875: 1.$9000
15/12/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 303 1875: 2. 5 years
15/12/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 303 1875: 3. $300
15/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 303 1875: 4. $750
15/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 303 1875: I have answered according to my understanding Ma'am
15/12/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response, however, I am sure the answer to your question1 is $900 and not $9000?
15/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Sure typing error
15/12/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, please. Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Yes its $1800 per year that is $900 per semester.Understood
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Thank you, maybe before that ,can you also highlight me on the $300 and $750 especially on the duration of payment
15/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Is it once off or ot can be paid on monthly installments?
15/12/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, yes please as I mentioned above as we move ahead with the discussion we shall cover all your queries.
15/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Understood
15/12/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you prefer to stay on campus it would have to be paid all at once, which is expensive for the students and parents and that is why our students prefer off-campus accommodations because it provides the same facilities at a cheaper cost, along with the freedom to cook for themselves as well. Now I understand being a parent you must be concerned about the safety as well.
15/12/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
15/12/23, 7:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
15/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Yes sure the safety
15/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Yes thank you
15/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 303 1875: So its also a once off payment mode per Annum
15/12/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For Off-campus you can pay every month since you will be directly paying the rent to the landlord.
15/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Oh its ok Ma'am and absolutely manageable
15/12/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
15/12/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Yes Ma'am,thank you
15/12/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/12/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Very clear
15/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/12/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/12/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 303 1875: I didn't get you here
15/12/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you explain, the $300 is the admission processing fee that you had to pay if you applied yourself, however, since your application is shared by Edoofa and we have prepared and arranged all the documents needed for Cathrine, it has been waived off for you. May I know if you are clear now?
15/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 303 1875: That means we will not pay it
15/12/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Yes Ma'am i was about to ask about that
15/12/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/12/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Thank you,i understand it very clearly.
15/12/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/12/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/12/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 303 1875: How about bank charges
15/12/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773031875 yes ma'am I am going to explain you everything please, I would encourage you to be patient, and let me know if you were able to go through the message above?
15/12/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 303 1875: No i dont reside in Harare,we are in the Rural areas
15/12/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Its ok
15/12/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/12/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/12/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/12/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Understood Ma'am
15/12/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Noted with thanks
15/12/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/12/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/12/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Thank you Ma'am
15/12/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
