10/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 519 4734: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms it is duly noted with us and we will update them in our records.

10/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Kirti we may continue
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 519 4734: I have gone through the university admission cycle Ms Kirti
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
10/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
10/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Understood Ms on the two parts.
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
10/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms we may proceed
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
10/10/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
10/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Clearly elaborated Ms Kirti
10/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Yes Ms we can move on
10/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 519 4734: My network is poor Ms bear with me please
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that the network can be a big challenge, it is alright please.
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
10/10/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
10/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Yes Ms you can send the video

10/10/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
10/10/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

11/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I await your response.
11/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 519 4734: On this video Ms Kirti I didn't get well the founder's explanation on China documents   with the program manager and the $1000 amount that was charged.
11/10/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, let me help you understand the videos through my point of view that will expand your thoughts.
11/10/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
11/10/23, 9:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 519 4734: This video is an insight on the student's journey to higher education with Edoofa, and they give students an opportunity to select institutions that are working together with Edoofa in India and other countries such as Egypt, Edoofa will assist with identifying good universities that will suit the student. Students can make education and friendship at Edoofa which is the bench mark at Edoofa,
11/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Thank you Ms Kirti now clearly understood
11/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted and well explained
11/10/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 519 4734: The video states about the documents required in the interactive sessions and the statement of purpose, why student choose that course and should be able to convince the university, citing their strength, mission and vision
11/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Thank you Ms Kirti it's now clear and sounding perfect
11/10/23, 10:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* I could see from your answer that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Sure Ms Kirti I  clearly understand the purpose of the SOP
11/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 519 4734: I had a long and busy day Ms Kirti may I kindly request to adjourn the session for now so that I find time to rest the we progress tomorrow.
11/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I understand that you must be tired, and as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm. 

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.
12/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 519 4734: It's very important for sure Ms Kirti but the challenge is that Faith is at a boarding school were they are not allowed to use cellphone until they are on holiday
12/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand the challenge of communication when Faith is at a boarding school. It can be quite restrictive in terms of staying in touch. That is alright please, can I anticipate she will be through with the tasks by Saturday?
12/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Kirti we will try to link with her so that she will part in the SOP
12/10/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now I have a news to share with you.

19/10/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Faith.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the statement of entry, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Good afternoon Ms Kirti we are available and ready to connect with you
19/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. *Now with this, we have put the second step on hold on faith's university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
19/10/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe she wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Commerce for her higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
19/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Yes thats true Ms Kirti bachelor of Commerce degree in Accounting
19/10/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 519 4734: We are ready Ms Kirti can move forward
19/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 519 4734: That's true it will not be possible for a student to study in multiple institutions but one has to choose one
19/10/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/10/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/10/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Yes Ms Kirti it was well explained
19/10/23, 3:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Understood Ms Kirti
19/10/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
19/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Clearly elaborated Ms Kirti
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
19/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Understood Ms
19/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
19/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/10/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Kirti thank you
19/10/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 519 4734: No queries yet Ms it's theoretically understood maybe we shall need further guidance when doing the process practically
19/10/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
19/10/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
19/10/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
19/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 519 4734: That's excellent to note Ms Kirti
19/10/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
19/10/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Thank you Ms you may share the edoofians
19/10/23, 6:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I hope you are excited to watch Faith in this picture for next year?
19/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 519 4734: They are in jovial mood as they are  proud to be edoofians
19/10/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 7:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

19/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 519 4734: That's true Ms Kirti I can't wait
19/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @263775194734. Please let me know once you have gone through the above benefits.
19/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Plan 5 which give the student a chance to retake the exam and be allowed to proceed in the following year is much appreciated
19/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

19/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Faith, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Kirti
19/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Well understood Ms Kirti
19/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Yes Ms it is resonating well
19/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 10:45 pm - +263 77 519 4734: It really simply the financial Constraint to the parents, well appreciated
19/10/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. However, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
19/10/23, 11:01 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Good evening Ms Kirti, I will also be available on the scheduled time if there are no changes on my working Schedule tomorrow .
20/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Faith,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Good day Ms Kirti we are available
20/10/23, 4:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I would love to continue with our discussions however, I regret to inform you that I'm currently not feeling well. As a result, I would like to reschedule our discussion for 08:00 pm CAT today. I hope that this new time works for you and that you'll be available to connect then. Thank you for your understanding.
20/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Wish you a speedy recovery Ms Kirti, we will be available at 2000hours today
20/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, following our prior conversation, I am pleased to inform you that I'm feeling better now. I would like to inquire if you are currently ready and available to join our discussion?
20/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 519 4734: I'm pleased to hear that you are feeling better Ms Kirti, we are available
20/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 519 4734: I'm clear Ms Kirti
20/10/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 519 4734: This message was deleted
20/10/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/10/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Only that I'm traveling the network is not stable but we can move forward
20/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 519 4734: You may provide more Information on that one Ms Kirti
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that network can be an issue. I appreciate your willingness to continue despite the network issue. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/10/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
20/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Well taken Ms Kirti thank you for elaborating
20/10/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Understood Ms
20/10/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Option 3 is not acceptable, one should opt to retake or go for a Diploma
20/10/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure she will not let such situation come up. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/10/23, 10:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/10/23, 10:56 pm - +263 77 519 4734: It's a fair option
20/10/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
20/10/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/10/23, 10:59 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Very clear Ms
20/10/23, 10:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/10/23, 11:05 pm - +263 77 519 4734: This one is not prefable though
20/10/23, 11:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however it is our responsibility to provide you with the benefit, the choice depend upon the student itself. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/10/23, 11:14 pm - +263 77 519 4734: No queries Ms
20/10/23, 11:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Faith's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that faith is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/10/23, 11:24 pm - +263 77 519 4734: I'm really excited and eager to move ahead
20/10/23, 11:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 519 4734: It's a perfect approach Ms Kirti we can resume our discussion
18/11/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
18/11/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 519 4734: Noted let me attempt
18/11/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Sure, I shall wait for your response.
18/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 519 4734: 1. Per annum tuition after the Scholarship=$0

2. Per annum accomodation fee after the Scholarship= $0

3. Anual fee at MNV University after the Scholarship= $1250

4.. Sports and Misc ==$125+ $125= $250

Admission and Processing fee =$1000
18/11/23, 11:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
18/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 519 4734: That is a great life time opportunity
18/11/23, 11:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
18/11/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1250 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1500.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1250. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
18/11/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 519 4734: Well elaborated Ms Kirti
18/11/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
18/11/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Kirti
18/11/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1250, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Clearly stated Ms Kirti
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 519 4734: It's so helpful Ms Kirti thank for enlightening
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
18/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 519 4734: That is really awesome Ms Kirti
18/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
18/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
18/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
18/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Kirti surely the burden has been lessened
18/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for faith is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
18/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
18/11/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
18/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Can you please add Faith Tigere to this group she is now done with her Final Exams

+263784384724
18/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have granted you the group admin, please go ahead and add her.
18/11/23, 1:49 pm - ~ . added +263 78 438 4724
18/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 519 4734: I would prefer a scholarship offer that allows me to save $850 annually
18/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Well agreed Ms Kirti
18/11/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
18/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 519 4734: It's clear Ms
18/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 29th, 2023*.
18/11/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Yes Ms can you explain further
18/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 29, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 29, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 29, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Well understood
18/11/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 2:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.
18/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 519 4734: I reside in Mutare Ms Kirti
18/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 519 4734: You shall forgive me Ms Kirti my network is becoming poor
18/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms Kirti thank you so much
18/11/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 519 4734: Noted Ms I will advise you about the means of payment I shall opt to use in dew course
18/11/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, let me share the payment mode just for your reference.
