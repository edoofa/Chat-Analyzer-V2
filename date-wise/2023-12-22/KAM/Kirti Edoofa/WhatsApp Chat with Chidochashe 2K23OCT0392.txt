10/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

11/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Good evening. How was your day?

11/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 361 3423: We can start
11/10/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I am done
11/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/10/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
11/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I have understood the two steps
11/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
11/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I am following
11/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/10/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 361 3423: They are clear
11/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/10/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes, we can start
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
11/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 361 3423: You can share the videos
11/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
11/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I can go through the videos during the day tomorrow then we can have our session at 8pm as usual
11/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That sounds like a plan. Thank you for confirming. I appreciate your commitment to reviewing the videos. After you've had the chance to go through them and summarize your understanding, we'll have a productive discussion during our scheduled session at 8pm tomorrow. If you have any questions or thoughts before then, feel free to reach out. Looking forward to our next session. Have a great day! <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Noted.
12/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Good evening
12/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
12/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 361 3423: We can begin
12/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, Chidochashe. May I know if you were able to go through the above videos?
12/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes, i went through the videos
12/10/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
12/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 361 3423: The first one was emphasizing on how students can get the most out  of the Edoofa schoolarship program by being willing to learn, being open minded and following instructions given

The second one was explaining the vision of the Edoofa program on making student employable by providing affordable, quality education, reducing financial strain on the students resulting in an increase in the student’s capacity for success and independence



The third one focused on university interaction, how the Edoofa program look for institutes where the existing students are happy, teaching staff have the appropriate qualifications and the institutions have the proper accreditation. 
The Edoofa program also establishes a sense of community in students which will later help them after completion of studies 
The institutions that work with Edoofa have EWYL programs which will give the students the right knowledge, attitude and skills


Lastly, the fourth video explained the importance of SOPs in convincing the university boards to allow admission
12/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/10/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

13/10/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Good evening. Hope you had a good day. We can begin our session for the day
13/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is M.Sc Microbiology and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 361 3423: That is correct
13/10/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
13/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes i am ready
13/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Noted
13/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 361 3423: It is not possible
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes we discussed the registration fee
13/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes, i understand
13/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
13/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
13/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
13/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes
13/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/10/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
13/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Noted
13/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/10/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
13/10/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/10/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 361 3423: No questions for now
13/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
13/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
13/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
13/10/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Noted. We are very excited
13/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
13/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
13/10/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
13/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I am ready
13/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
13/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
13/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I have reviewed the benefits
13/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
13/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
13/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Noted
13/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
13/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
13/10/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I understand
13/10/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
13/10/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I understand
13/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/10/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I understand. No questions for now
13/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Does this also apply to me since i already have my A level results and i have completed my bachelors degree?
13/10/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, you are correct. I am happy that you have corrected it.  Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I have understood all your explanations. No questions for now
13/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

21/12/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Chidochashe,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 5:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Good evening
21/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 361 3423: We are really excited about the offer letter and what it means for my academic journey
21/12/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
21/12/23, 6:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
21/12/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes, the approach works for me
21/12/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
21/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 361 3423: 1.$1375
2.2years
3.$200
4.$700
21/12/23, 6:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 2-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 4 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1375 making your per annum tuition fee ($1375*2) = $2750. Is that clear?
21/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes it is clear
21/12/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
21/12/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
21/12/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
21/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Ok noted.
Given that i will be in India when schools open, how will i find the outside accommodation whilst im still in Zimbabwe
21/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263783613423 you do not have to worry about that, our officials will be assisting you after your arrival in India.
21/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
21/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
21/12/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
21/12/23, 7:13 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Ok i understand
21/12/23, 7:14 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Very clear
21/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
21/12/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I understand
21/12/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes we are still together
21/12/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Please explain
21/12/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of January 4 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of February 3 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 7:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before January 3 2024. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Understood
21/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 361 3423: The option is clear now. Thank you
21/12/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I stay in Gweru
21/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 361 3423: I will get in touch with him
21/12/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Ok. I still have Mr Jerera’s banking details
21/12/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright please, let me share again just for reference.

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
21/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Thank you
21/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
21/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 361 3423: Yes i understand
21/12/23, 8:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 361 3423: No queries at the moment
21/12/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
21/12/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
21/12/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
21/12/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

21/12/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
21/12/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.

This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Saturday which is 23rd December. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
