05/09/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Sharmel,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family, Sharmel?
15/09/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Sharmel may face some difficulties in attending our session due to school activities. I kindly request both you and Sharmel to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?

21/12/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since we last connected. I understand that the exam schedules have made it difficult for us to connect. In addition to this, I was also assigned to the university campus visits that are associated with us. Now that your exams are over, I believe we can resume our sessions. Could you please let me know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for your admission process?
