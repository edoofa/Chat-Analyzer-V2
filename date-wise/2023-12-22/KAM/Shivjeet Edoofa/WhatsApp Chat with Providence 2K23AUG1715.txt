19/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I have  gone through the admission process
19/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
19/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Very clear sir
19/09/23, 10:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
19/09/23, 10:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
19/09/23, 10:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it's getting late and our available time is coming to a close, I'd like to bring our current session to a close. Let's reconvene tomorrow at 7:30 pm. Wishing you a restful night!
20/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I'm very well sir
20/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir I'm ready
20/09/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/09/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 511 0068: So sir this registration fee of $500 to $750 how long does it take to pay the money
20/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. You will be provided with a time frame of 2 weeks. Please also note that the deadline for the registration fees is totally dependent on the university.
20/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir
20/09/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 511 0068: What about the earn while you learn program
20/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The EWYL credits will be applicable only to your tuition fees, and they will be activated once you have arrived in India. May I know if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 10:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late and my available hours are coming to an end, I shall be concluding our session for now and let us connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM. Have a great night and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
14/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Let us proceed
16/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the audios?
16/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes l did
16/10/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
16/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I shall wait for the same.
16/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 511 0068: The founders  of Edoofa encourages students to follow Edoofa's instructions and they should be teachable and open-minded. The SOP give a unique opportunity for every student to convince the admission board students have to display those skills,  strength your achievements from the past most importantly the SOP should not only include your goals but also your Vision bu your academic progress why you have chosen that particular course .
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
16/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes we are on the same page
16/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
16/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
16/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

16/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
16/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

In the mean tIme may I know if your parents are available for the session?
16/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes they are available
16/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I would also like to let you know that your EWYL session was scheduled to commence on the 12th of September. However, due to the inconsistency of our session, we were not able to do that, so I will be rescheduling your EWYL session for the 20th of September. May I know if you have taken note of the new date?
17/10/23, 6:59 am - +263 78 511 0068: Good morning mr Shivjeet

23/10/23, 3:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do excuse me. I have shared you with the details again.
23/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Thank you
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the mean time, shall we proceed with the session, dear?
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Diploma (Computer Science Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
23/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 511 0068: That is correct
25/10/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Providence!

I hope you are doing well today. I am now available to take on your session. Please note that I will also be available in the Evening at 7:30 PM as well. So, if you are currently available now, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I'm fine thank you
25/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes let us proceed
25/10/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/10/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust you've had a wonderful day so far. I apologize for not being available earlier as it was beyond my designated hours. However, I am now fully prepared to kickstart our session. It's important to note that I'll also be at your disposal in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's seize this opportunity and make the most out of our session.
26/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir
26/10/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/10/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I'm an o- level student sir
26/10/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed. Thank you for the clarification. In that case, we can help you with the below two steps.
*1. Reappear in O Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir l agree with option number 1
26/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in O Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the O Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I'm very clear sir
26/10/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we got to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon.

I will be concluding our session for the day and look forward to continuing our discussions tomorrow, starting from 12:00 PM. Additionally, I will also be available in the evening from 7:30 PM onward. In the meantime, I hope you have a wonderful evening, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Thank you sir
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking, dear. Certainly, we shall now proceed.
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
30/10/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
30/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Very clear sir
30/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
30/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 511 0068: That one is not for me l can't quit education
30/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 78 511 0068: What if I'm not ready for admission yet
30/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are having any concerns, dear?
30/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Let's say l don't have the $750 for registration fee
30/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: From the above messages, you have a grant of $150 waiting for you, and if the registration is $750, the cost would be $600, dear.
30/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir
30/10/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, for this reason, most of your peers have already completed their admission process, dear.
30/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 511 0068: So you mean they have paid the $600
30/10/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If the registration fee is $750, yes indeed they have paid $600.
30/10/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Wow that is good l hope my parents would be able to pay mine
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are  among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
30/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir I'm looking forward to the next step and receive the offer letter
30/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation.

15/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Thank you so much l really appreciate
15/11/23, 12:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You're very welcome, and I appreciate your kind words. I'm here to assist you through this exciting phase of your academic journey. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 511 0068: 1. 1800 USD

2. 3 Years

3. 300 USD

4.$750
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if the answer to question 1 that I provided here is correct?
15/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 511 0068: It's written 1800USD
15/11/23, 1:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 511 0068: It's now clear
15/11/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 2:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 511 0068: It means l will have to choose when l arrived in India right
15/11/23, 2:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's correct. Upon your arrival in India, you'll have the opportunity to choose your accommodation based on your preferences. The university provides one day of stay at the on-campus accommodation, during which you can explore and evaluate the available options. This way, you can make an informed decision about whether you prefer on-campus accommodation or Off Campus. May I know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Very clear sir
15/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir I'm following
15/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I'm clear with it
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 2:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir we are together
15/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 511 0068: What if l don't have the money now? Will l be given more time to pay
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do not worry I am coming to the installments that you are eligible for. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir explain
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 511 0068: It's very clear now
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes l stay in Harare
15/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay sir thank you for the contact
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 511 0068: It looks like this one the charges are high
15/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I completely understand your concern about the transfer charges. If you find the charges for the international transfer method to be high, you are absolutely correct in exploring alternative options. Mr. Rajan's assistance provides a potentially more cost-effective and convenient solution. But for your reference I am providing you with the details for Mr. Shorwi as well.
15/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
15/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details?
15/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I have received the details
15/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Okay l understand so that means my scholarship will cover the total cost and also the EWYL program.
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Your scholarship will cover your tuition fees, and the EWYL program will help you further reduce your fees on your tuition fees. May I know if you are clear here?
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Very clear sir
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Alright
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Providence!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet 
I'm ready to start our session
16/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today as this discussion is almost over?
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 511 0068: What will happen if l haven't found the money by the deadline
16/11/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges regarding the deadline, dear?
16/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes
16/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Would you be able to relate it to me?
16/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Currently our family is not financially stable
16/11/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you can elaborate on the challenges that you are facing so that I can have a deeper knowledge and assess this situation better?
16/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, and let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Currently I'm not the only child who goes to school , l have siblings whom my parents need to attend to not just that we also have rentals to pay.
17/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me share you more glimpse of the university as well

17/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasize the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
17/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
17/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Monday at 7:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
17/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Yes sir it sounds good
17/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Have a great weekend.
17/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Thank you Mr Shivjeet
20/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Providence!

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 511 0068: Good evening sir
20/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I'm so excited to receive the university offer letter. It has been my dream to study abroad and my family is also happy about it

Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively.

21/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
21/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Valerie.vcf (file attached)

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India.

You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you? <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 511 0068: I'm considering paying the registration fee in two instalments
21/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
