07/12/23, 8:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Bruce,

I hope you are doing well and we find you in the best of spirits. Regarding your question about when the A Level Results/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level) will be required, these documents constitute a major part of your application file. The earlier you can secure them, the sooner we will be able to complete your application.
07/12/23, 8:28 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Since you will be writing your A Level exams next year and schools are closed until January 9, 2024, here is what you can do in the meantime: you can obtain a letter of recommendation from your school. To assist you in this process, we have attached a sample document.
07/12/23, 8:30 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. Visit Your School: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. Provide Necessary Information: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. Printing and Signing: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. Include Authority Details: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application.
07/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 618 0909: Quick question:
Does this recommendation letter cover up for the statement of entry and the A level results or all the three are still needed at the end of the day 🤷🏾‍♂️
Is there a possibility that he can get a university to accept him soon after he sends the recommendation letter.If not ,then can he send all the documents at once when everything is ready .But if somehow this delays his chances of getting a university offer fast we could still try get the recommendation as per your request as early as this holiday . <This message was edited>

21/12/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/12/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
