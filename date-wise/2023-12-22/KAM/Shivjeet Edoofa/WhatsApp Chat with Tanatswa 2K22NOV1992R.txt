25/09/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, Tanatswa, may I know if you have decided to proceed with the course BBA IT?

BBA IT is a specialized program focusing on the intersection of business management and information technology. Due to its specialized nature, it tends to have a higher cost compared to more general courses.

The estimated cost for pursuing a BBA IT program typically ranges between $2700 to $3700. This includes tuition fees, materials, and other associated expenses for the entire course. It's important for students to consider this cost aspect while planning their educational finances.
25/09/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 328 7663: However l am not willing to do a degree that require lower points when l have more than the points required
25/09/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am really happy to hear that from you. However, since you are enrolled in the Edoofa program I am sure that you will be able to score more points and will be able to achieve a higher quantum of scholarship. May I know if we are clear here?
25/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 328 7663: But l can not do BBA IT
25/09/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know what happened, dear?
25/09/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 328 7663: I can not do a degree that needs 3 points when l have secured more than 3 points
25/09/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you clarify. If you want to pursue any course that you are eligible in India for your higher education, the eligibility criteria are a little different than in Zimbabwe. Universities look for passing grades in specific subjects rather than solely focusing on points. The university will seek if you have passed all the required subjects, meaning securing at least 1 point in each of the three subjects you will be appearing for in your A levels.
25/09/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
