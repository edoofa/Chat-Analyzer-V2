I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
21/10/23, 8:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear Parents and Mitchell!

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa*. Over the past several months, we have eagerly anticipated your response and active engagement with our admissions team to advance your university admission journey. Unfortunately, despite our unwavering dedication and continuous outreach, we have yet to receive any communication from your side.
21/10/23, 8:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you joined the Edoofa Scholarship Program back in November 2022, your enthusiasm for embarking on this educational adventure was truly commendable. However, as we fast approach 2024, your peers who embarked on this journey with you have successfully completed the admission process and are now eagerly preparing for their upcoming arrival in India. It's undeniable that there's a gap in progress, and we are acutely aware of it.
21/10/23, 8:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this situation, I personally reached out to the Academic Board to explore viable solutions for your unique circumstances. We understand the challenges you've faced and the delays you've encountered in comparison to your peers. We're here to bridge that gap.
21/10/23, 8:16 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The Academic Board has, once again, emphasized the importance of open communication. We want to create an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns and challenges that have been holding you back in this process. Your voice is invaluable, and your active participation is crucial in ensuring that we provide you with the guidance and solutions needed to help you catch up and continue your journey toward success. We're here to support you every step of the way.
22/10/23, 11:43 am - +27 73 040 8303: We're well sir, sorry for the inconvenience as we seat down as parents and kid according with finance issues so we decide for a kid to take a gape year next
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Mitchell!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. I am sorry to hear that. May I know what exactly happened to your finances?
21/12/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Mitchell. I hope this message finds you well today.

It has been a while since the last time that we are connected with each other. I was hoping for a reply from you end on my previous message so that I can understand your situation better and come forward with a potential solution. It appears that you were not able to respond to my messages. As your admission officer I am committed to help Mitchell to secure her higher education. Hence, if you are able to see my message please let me know and kindly answer to my message so that we can move forward.
