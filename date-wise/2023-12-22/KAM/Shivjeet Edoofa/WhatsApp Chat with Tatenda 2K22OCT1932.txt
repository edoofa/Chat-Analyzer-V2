I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

21/12/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you're doing well today. Over the past few months, I've been attempting to connect with you, but it seems my efforts have been unsuccessful. I've noticed that you've seen my messages. I remember how enthusiastic you were about your higher education journey abroad during your enrollment. By now, most of your peers have completed their admission processes, and I'd love for you to be on track with them. If you receive this message, could you please let me know your availability? I'd like to proceed with the admission process session and kick-start your admission before it is too late.
