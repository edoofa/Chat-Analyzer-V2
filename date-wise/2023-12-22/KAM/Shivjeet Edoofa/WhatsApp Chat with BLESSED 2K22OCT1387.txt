21/12/23, 2:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since we last connected. I understand that the exam schedules have made it difficult for us to connect. In addition to this, I was also assigned to the university campus visits that are associated with us. Now that your exams are over and all your peers have completed their admission process, it is high time we resume our sessions. Could you please let me know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for your admission process?
