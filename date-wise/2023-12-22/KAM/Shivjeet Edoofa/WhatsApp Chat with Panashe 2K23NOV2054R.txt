For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
05/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet let's start
05/12/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes, am done Mr Shivjeet
05/12/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
05/12/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
05/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I have thank you
05/12/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
05/12/23, 6:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
05/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am thank you Mr Shivjeet
05/12/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
05/12/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes there are Mr Shivjeet thank you
05/12/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet we can proceed
05/12/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/12/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
05/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet you may proceed
05/12/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

05/12/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
05/12/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Tomorrow morning Mr Shivjeet
06/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 623 2165: Good morning Mr Shivjeet how are you doing


What I have understood after watching the videos is that the student should follow instructions and listen to expert as well as the elevation of levels when the co-founder illustrated a cup and a tank holding different capacity of water. Also learnt that the co-founders play a parental role in ensuring students there get quality education by enrolling them in the best schools, colleges and universities. In the universities the Edoofa program provides EWYL in those universities ensuring that the student is able to master the concepts of being independent and hard worker which will later pay off when they attain their degree and there are different from the other students who did not do their internship through the EWYL program. That is what I have understood Mr Shivjeet.
06/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th.

Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

15/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 623 2165: (2. Elaborate on the difference between rights and duties and give a further explanation of the difference in Human rights and Civil rights


Rights, a right is a power or claim possessed by an individual to do something for example children have the right to education whilst Duty is an obligation to do or omit to do something for example Parents is their duty to fulfill their needs and wants. Moreover, right is an interest recognized and protected by the state whereas Duty is an obligation created and imposed by the state. Also, every legal right has a corresponding duty whilst every legal duty has not a corresponding right. In addition, a person whose right is violated can go to court for remedy whilst a person who has not full filled his duty is subjected to punishment. Furthermore, a person is free to not exercise his rights whilst a person is not free to not fulfill his duties. Rights help to control others action as per own wish whilst Duty impose obligations to act as per other's will. Human rights are rights one acquires by being alive whilst Civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. Human rights include, the right to life and the right to education. Civil rights include protection from discrimination.


(3. The difference between a prosecutor and an attorney.


Prosecutor, government official charged with bringing defendants in criminal cases to justice in the name of the state. Prosecutors are in charge of all phases of a criminal proceeding from the investigation by the police through the trial and beyond to all levels of appeal. Many also defend the state in civil actions. In the United kingdom, prosecution is carried out in the name of the crown. In this sense the crown can be said to prosecute and the prosecution is often referred to as "the crown",whereas an attorney they provide professional advice, prepare documents, and appear in court to plead on behalf of their clients on litigation involving them and research all case elements , including official documentation in including a police report. They pay close attention to the legal system elements that pertain to the client's case and search for relevant, previously filed pleadings. Attorneys formulate strategy on behalf of clients intending to find timely and look effective ways to manage legal issues. Rather than take a case to trial, attorneys attempt to resolve it promptly. Attorneys familiarize themselves with a client's case.


(4. Which branch of law are you most interested in pursuing, Civil, Corporate or Criminal, and why?


Criminal law, the body of law that defines criminal offenses, regulates the apprehension, charging and trial of suspected person and fixes penalties and modes of treatment applicable to convicted offenders. This branch am interested in pursuing it because there are some cases whereby one is charged for a crime that they did not commit and spend their rest of their lives in prison so I took it upon myself to be more interested in the criminal branch so that I can prove their Innocence and provide justice. The criminal branch is the only one of the devices by which organized societies protect the security of individual interests and ensure the survival of the group. There are in addition the standards of conduct instilled bt family , school, and religion, the rules of the office and factory. The branch serves the purpose of criminal law which prevent crime with the development of the social sciences there arose new concepts, such as those of the protection of the public and the reform of the offender. Am more interested in the important differences exist between the criminal law of most , English speaking countries.


(5. What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer


Firstly, there is good verbal communication, a lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding. Secondly, I have good time management I have the art of delegation tasks, working within, deadlines, and prioritizing tasks, to achieve success is very essential. Moreover, self-confidence. I have the ability to have a strong belief in myself which will go a long way in winning arguments and cases. Furthermore, Patience is an attribute of my skill. I have the ability to deal with different types of people and some cases , and procedures stretch over a period of time which my patience is needed and careful handling. Lastly team work skills, since the field am going to learn will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective there is need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information with people helps in attaining the objectives

19/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am Mr Shivjeet thank you , we can proceed
19/12/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes it is accurate Mr Shivjeet
19/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
19/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
19/12/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/12/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes I am
19/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/12/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon.
19/12/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 623 2165: I definitely agree with Edoofa Financial Secure Plan it is the backbone for parents /students
19/12/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continuw tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Panashe!

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 623 2165: How are you Mr Shivjeet sorry for the late reply, am ready for the session
21/12/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above vidoes?
21/12/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 623 2165: Yes Mr Shivjeet
21/12/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
21/12/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 623 2165: What I have understood after watching the videos is that the student should follow instructions and listen to experts as well as the elevation of levels when the co-founder illustrated a cup and a tank holding different capacity of water. Also learnt that the co-founders play a parental role in ensuring students there get quality education by enrolling them in the best schools, colleges and universities. In the universities the Edoofa program provides EWYL in those universities ensuring that the student is able to master the concepts of being independent and hard work which will later pay off when they attain their degree and they pursue their desired career which will make them  different from the other students who did not do their internship through the EWYL program. And the Edoofa program is there to empower the vision of the students and facilitating the education system which will later pay off when there acquire their degrees.
21/12/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos.
