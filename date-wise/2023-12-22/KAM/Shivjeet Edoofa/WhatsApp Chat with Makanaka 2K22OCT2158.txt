21/12/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since we last connected. I understand that the exam schedules have made it difficult for us to connect since Makanaka is at boarding school. In addition to this, I was also assigned to the university campus visits that are associated with us. Now that your exams are over, I believe we can resume our sessions. Could you please let me know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for your admission process?
