05/09/23, 1:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Tafadzwa,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family, Tafadzwa?

18/10/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.

19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been left unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*

When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
26/10/23, 6:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you've had a great day. It appears I didn't receive a response from you, and it seems my previous message went unanswered. Nonetheless, I am fully prepared to initiate our session. I would like you to participate more actively in our session because there are certain benefits that I would be happy to provide you with more insights on, so you don't miss out on these opportunities. If you're ready to start now, let's make the most of this opportunity and have a productive session.
27/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tafadzwa!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as we are approaching the weekend, we are limited by our time.  I understand, and I'm truly sorry to hear about the difficult circumstances you're facing. It's important to prioritize what's best for your family and your well-being. We appreciate your kind words, and we understand that sometimes situations change.
27/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For further continuation with sufficient time and productivity and I wanted to discuss this situation with you and help you better, I will be available from 3:00 PM on the coming Monday, which is the 30th of October, to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, as we can do that too. Thank you for your understanding, and please do enjoy your weekend.
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 800 7202: Ok thank you too for your kindness. An evening session is more appropriate
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with us; we shall work on that as well.

20/12/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
21/12/23, 6:12 am - +263 71 800 7202: Greetings to you kind sir. My apologies.... We are nolonger able to take on this edoofa program. Reasons being the financial status of the family so you may now cancel her name so you may not waste time on her anymore. We agreed as a family. We are sorry about that
