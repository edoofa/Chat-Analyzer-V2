I hope you are having a fine weekend. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session a little early today as it is the weekend. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
26/10/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you've had a great day. It appears I didn't receive a response from you, and it seems my previous message went unanswered. Nonetheless, I am fully prepared to initiate our session. I would like you to participate more actively in our session because there are certain benefits that I would be happy to provide you with more insights on, so you don't miss out on these opportunities. If you're ready to start now, let's make the most of this opportunity and have a productive session.
21/12/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Mwaka.
21/12/23, 4:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you're doing well today. Over the past few months, I've been attempting to connect with you, but it seems my efforts have been unsuccessful. I've noticed that you've seen my messages. I remember how enthusiastic you were about your higher education journey abroad during your enrollment and I am still here for you to make that dream come true.

By now, most of your peers have completed their admission processes, and I'd love for you to be on track with them. If you receive this message, could you please let me know your availability? I'd like to proceed with the admission process session and kick-start your admission before it is too late.
