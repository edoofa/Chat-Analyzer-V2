This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
22/11/23, 12:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Tendai EWYL23E0949)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
22/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 338 7901: We can go ahead with the session sir
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Very clear on this one
22/11/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 338 7901: So with our counsellor ..am really impressed with the fact that Edoofa scholarship has worked an enrolled more than 2000 students allover giving people opportunities and having a counsellor who can direct you in the next step and guiding us every step . The Edoofa EWYL that a learner though this might even end up paying less through doing and completing the tasks given hence reduce even the pressure of monies needed and i learnt that so far a student in record has earbed $3000 through this EWYL. 
Education abroad is really expensive and through Edoofa scholarship students will be able to do desired courses cheaper in India than anywhere else . So in this journey parents involvement is crutial so that together we can plan for the life of the student abroad and we will be well informed
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 455 3293: The Edoofa Program in itself is a great opportunity to most talented  students who might have  high ambitions but unable to accomplish them because of financial constraints.Edoofa has made it  simpler by the provision of the Scholarship itself ie 50-100%scholarship; The counseling program in guiding the family about the program, assisting in University enrollment with and the EWYL program which enables the students to further reduce university fees by earning credits thus  making the educational dream a reality in lessening the parental burdens in financial balancing
22/11/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the detailed information and for sharing your conversation with our counselor. Indeed, Edoofa's approach in enrolling over 2000 students and guiding each step through counseling is impressive. The EWYL program stands out as a practical means to potentially lessen the financial strain on students by earning credits and reducing the overall expenses.

The provision of 50-100% scholarships is a game-changer for students with high aspirations but limited financial means. The counseling's focus on university enrollment and the EWYL program's ability to further mitigate fees are crucial elements that showcase how Edoofa eases the financial load on parents.
22/11/23, 12:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed.

23/11/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, it's crucial to provide accurate information about Tendai's health conditions.

It's essential for the institution to be aware of these conditions to ensure proper care and the universities will provide you with the same.

27/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
27/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir.  lets proceed
27/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Done sir....and because u are going to explain them one by one I don't have any question yet
27/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
27/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
27/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes they are clear but isn't  step number 2 precisely for Tendai(the student) to answer for herself?
27/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
27/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
27/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ok
27/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir
27/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 455 3293: And this would be after the A Level results are out.Is that so?
27/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No it not and we will be coming to that very soon.
27/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
27/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
27/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ok, before the results are out?
27/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ok....
27/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
27/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Does step 5 take some months or it's just a matter of weeks?....If so,Will there be ample time to have $1000 in less than 3months?We are mostly salary based .  Again, Tendai will be turning 18 on January  27 when schools open.So we intended to have her take a passport in April 2024 during the holidays.And isn't when the visa Application possible?
27/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 455 3293: 👆I have some questions there
27/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:00 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Thank you sir.Goodbye

28/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir....let's proceed
28/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
28/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

18/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 455 3293: 2.What skills do you need to be an aerospace engineer?

To become an aerospace engineer you need a strong foundation in mathematics and physics .These skills are essential for understanding the principles of flight aerodynamics and propulsion. The principal of flight is made-up of four fundamental forces, lift, weight drag and thrust .These forces work together in a delicate balance to determine an aircrafts trajectory withlift and weight opposing each other and thrust and drag doing the same.

Propulsion A vehicle moving through a fluid such as air or water is acted on by four forces lift , weight,thrust and drag 

Flight An airplane rotates in bank ,pitch and yaw while also moving horizontally, vertically and laterally . The fundamentals straight and level flight,turns ,climbs and descendants are the principal maneuvers that control the airplane through the six motions of flight.


The knowledge of computer programming materials science and mechanical energy is beneficial.
Problem solving an critical thinking and communication skills are important for this field 
These forces make an object make up and down and faster or slow
19/12/23, 8:27 am - Akshit Edoofa KAM joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 7:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you are doing well and blessed today. Please excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a university official today. May I know if you are available to proceed with our session?
19/12/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 455 3293: 3.How are the theories aerodynamics used in the aerospace engineering field

Theories of aerodynamics play a cruicial role in the aerospace engineering field.
Engineers use these theories to design  and analyse aircraft , spacecraft and other aerospace vehicles.

These principles of aerodynamics,engineers can optimise the shape ,size and performance of these vehicles.They use such as Bernoulli's principle, Newton laws of motion and the concept of drag to predict and control the behavior of air and fluid flow around the vehicle.
 They also play a crucial role in the aerospace engineering field.They are used to understand and predict the behavior of aircraft and spacecraft in various flight conditions
 
The theories of aerodynamics are designing aircraft,performance , stability and control, wind tunnel testing and computatoral fluid dynamics  

1. Designing aircraft: Aerodynamics theories are used to design the shape and configuration of aircraft wings, fuselage, and other components. The flow of air around these structures, engineers can optimize their design for efficient lift, reduced drag, and improved stability.

2. Performance analysis: Aerodynamics theories help engineers analyze the performance of aircraft and spacecraft. They can predict factors such as lift, drag, thrust, and fuel consumption under different flight conditions. This information is crucial for determining the aircraft's range, speed, and payload capacity.

3.

Stability and control: Aerodynamics theories are used to study the stability and control of aircraft.These  forces and moments act on an aircraft, engineers can design control surfaces like ailerons, elevators, and rudders to ensure stable flight and maneuverability.

4. Wind tunnel testing: Aerodynamics theories guide the design and interpretation of wind tunnel tests. Wind tunnels are used to simulate the airflow around an aircraft or spacecraft at different speeds and angles.
The data collected from these tests helps validate and refine the aerodynamic models used in the design process.

5. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD): Aerodynamics theories are implemented in computer simulations known as CFD. These simulations use mathematical equations to model the flow
19/12/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 455 3293: 4: Lift augmentation
Devices are used in aircraft to enhance the lift generated by the wings .

Flaps 
These are hinged surface on the trailing edge of the wings that can be extended or retracted .By extending the flaps the wings surface area increases creating more lift at lower speeds such as during take off and landing

Slats are movable surfaces located at the leading edge of the wings when extended .

The most common high lift devices are flaps ,stats and Krueger flaps but the category also induces less common installations such as leading edge root extensions which are found on high performance fighter aircraft and boundary layer control devices inclusive of blown flaps .

20/12/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Tendai!

I hope you are doing well today. I was not able to connect with you earlier as it was past my available hours at the moment. I would like to let you know that our available hours daily will be from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day for this session. With that said may I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Afternoon sir we are ready to proceed
20/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Evening sir we are ready to proceed
20/12/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Thank you for providing the details with me. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

However, before we do the same, I was going through your scholarship application file and noticed that you are supposed to make the payment of your remaining part of Edoofa Enrollment fee before 20th December 2023. Hence, I thought of sharing a gentle reminder with you and trying to understand how your preparation has been so far? Have you been able to align your preparations in the right direction?
20/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Sir the payment we were supposed to do isn't it $350 ? If so we have paid in full . We can resend the proof of payment.
20/12/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. There was a clerical error on our end. Yes you have paid the full amount, please.
20/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ok sir thank you
20/12/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, let us move forward with our discussion. To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2025. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes that's correct
20/12/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
20/12/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
20/12/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
20/12/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir you can elaborate further
20/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
20/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
20/12/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ok l understand. So how does this plan work <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/12/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Ok thank you
21/12/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tendai !

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
21/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Good evening sir ,yes we can proceed
21/12/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above points?
21/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes
21/12/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
21/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes sir
21/12/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
21/12/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2700-$3700, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
21/12/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
21/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Yes we agree . And that after  20 months we could have saved $3000
21/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
21/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
21/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective? <This message was edited>
21/12/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Yes yes i see but isnt b tech aerospace a four year course . Using information we received earlier when we got the explanation of the course
21/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 71 338 7901: We were of the opinion that tendai starts her EWYL in November 2025 after she sits for her final exams . Shes in a school where use of phones is prohibited and the EWYL will not be conducted smoothly because of this . But after shes done she will have access ro a phone .
21/12/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 338 7901: However during holidays which are a month long she will have access to a phone . I dont know if the EWYL can be done during her holidays which are at most 30 days .
21/12/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct, please excuse me for the error here.
21/12/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Okay
21/12/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: About the EWYL process that is completely possible and we shall have a detailed explanation about the same once we have shared you with the details. May I know if you are clear with me now?
21/12/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 455 3293: Yes
21/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/12/23, 9:01 pm - +263 71 338 7901: Thank you sir . Same to you .
