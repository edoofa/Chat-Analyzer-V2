I hope you've had a great day. It appears I didn't receive a response from you, and it seems my previous message went unanswered. Nonetheless, I am fully prepared to initiate our session. I would like you to participate more actively in our session because there are certain benefits that I would be happy to provide you with more insights on, so you don't miss out on these opportunities. If you're ready to start now, let's make the most of this opportunity and have a productive session.

I understand that the exam schedules have made it difficult for us to connect. In addition to this, I was also assigned to the university campus visits that are associated with us. Now that your exams are over, I believe we can resume our sessions. Could you please let me know if you are currently available to proceed with the session for your admission process?
