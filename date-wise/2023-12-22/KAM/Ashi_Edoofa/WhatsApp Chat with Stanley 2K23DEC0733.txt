18/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Job @263719875652 !
18/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
18/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
18/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
18/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 71 987 5652: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Is it needed soon because for the mean time my school is in far away from Harare and as well mostly inZimbabwe recommendation  letter are given after results are out but I can try to reach my O level administration to do this for me since there are already out but truly speaking I cannot mention  the exact dates for the letter I have to go and confirm  since my schools  are all far far away from my residential area and there are in different  provinces... Let me try to be quick....
18/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, You can try contacting our school officials, but please try to keep us posted on the progress of the document.
18/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes let me try so
18/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I am
18/12/23, 5:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 987 5652: We can do it
18/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I'm done
18/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
18/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
18/12/23, 5:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear.
18/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please
18/12/23, 5:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
18/12/23, 5:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/12/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
18/12/23, 5:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
18/12/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I'm in
18/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok
18/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 987 5652: We can proceed
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
18/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
18/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 987 5652: There are heavy rains here maybe we might have network challenges
18/12/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok I get it Ms

18/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes we and let's dig in to that
18/12/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 987 5652: But there heavy  rains network challenges  are expected

18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

19/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes Good afternoon  to you also Ms Ashi I'm happy to resume with you.. Yes we have gone through the videos  with my family  and we enjoyed and lent alot.. And we learnt that Edoofa scholarship program has the mortive to give students best education  to be affordable  and as well to follow instructions  on the first  video 
The second video  exposed many things which involves the  love given by Edoofa to its students as well as making sure that their students get to the right  universities and also create love and friendship  upon student and gratitudes during  rituals called Holy..... 
They also mentioned  about a student by the name Hanna or Canna I guess whom paid $1000 to an agent and was tricked until Vivi had a hand to her problem  and later she was in cloud nine because  of Edoofa goodness and also they mentioned  that Edoofa  as a community solves its problem solves its problems  as a whole and lastley
The (SOP)   THIS involves  the recommendation  letter  which is a paramount  to all application  done to any university you may want and once it done that one you have to take your time to write the required  qns asked on why you opted to study  such a course you have chosen and they said one should be smarts and for best results one should not delay and be smarta
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Its raining  here I'm sorry there  might be network challenges
19/12/23, 12:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to know that @263719875652. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/12/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/12/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/12/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/12/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/12/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok i get it

Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 987 5652: yes we are
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

Human rights are the fundamental rights that are given to all people regardless of where one leaves or nationality but Guided by International like the universal of Human Rights which include the right to life liberty and security, while civil rights are rights obtained from being legal member of a certain political state also protected by laws of a particular country as they protect rights of citizens
3. A prosecutor in criminal case is the one who representes the state, a lawyer who works for the government towards crime cases, An Attorney is a lawyer who can either represent  prosecution  or the defense in a case
4. Criminal law because I've seen how some people been wrongly accused and sent to prison because they do not have legal  representation 
5. I can analyze legal issues for I had analyzed issues in relationship to patriotic Act,  advantages and disadvantages of said piece of legislation also in survey,  I believe this will help me in legal research for I have done enough research  to understand the difference between a "tort and a crime"
20/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Hallo im here for today's  session  are there Ms Ashi
20/12/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Stanley, Wishing you a good day !
20/12/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. Let's start with the third step, Are you ready?
20/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Same to you how are today we are all good
20/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please
20/12/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am fine dear, thank you for asking.
20/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok  thank you
20/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 987 5652: We can do it im ready for it
20/12/23, 12:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you dear, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/12/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please😂
20/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok
20/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 987 5652: I get it
20/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes
20/12/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263719875652 . Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/12/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/12/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes we gone through som factors
20/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok
20/12/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok
20/12/23, 1:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes we are I ge now get it
20/12/23, 1:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
20/12/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
20/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 987 5652: OK i can get it now
20/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes
20/12/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/12/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
20/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 987 5652: OK OK i get it
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/12/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok I get it that shows that i cant start earn while you learn  before  receiving  an acceptance letter
20/12/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed dear, Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 987 5652: No I'm good to go
20/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
20/12/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Thank you im very eager to have that
20/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263719875652 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Wow there are so smart
20/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Sure sure Ms Ashi and also you guys are my empowerment u changed my life as l assume that I will pass with flying colours
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you will be able to achieve the same dear, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 987 5652: OK im done with them all
20/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ok this is so wonderful
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/12/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes yes please
20/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 987 5652: This is great
20/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
20/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes yes
20/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts. <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 25, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 25, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I under stand it but surely   as l can see for now my parents are capable to pay all these money maybe after paying my siblings  fees yes that one there are going to do but for the mean time there are soacked by economic situation leading to financial instability  but l promises my father is willing tto fund all the money needed
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand dear, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
20/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 987 5652: You may provide it
20/12/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 987 5652: With information
20/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/12/23, 2:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
20/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes please
20/12/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
20/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes sure
20/12/23, 2:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes I agree and im not going to gace all these because I believe  that im going ti score more than 11 points
20/12/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to hear that @263719875652, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
20/12/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/12/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes im clear
20/12/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
20/12/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes
20/12/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
20/12/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Ooo okay
20/12/23, 3:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Noo
20/12/23, 3:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 987 5652: Yes Ms
20/12/23, 3:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
