31/10/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
31/10/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 7:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted
31/10/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
31/10/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Yes
31/10/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
31/10/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31/10/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 31, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 31, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 31, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
31/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted
31/10/23, 7:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 416 4874: I'm really excited for this opportunity
31/10/23, 7:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
08/11/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
08/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Thank you so much i really appreciate
08/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted,
08/11/23, 7:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263784164874. I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 7:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Yes it's clear, we can discuss further
08/11/23, 7:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263784164874. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 7:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - +263 78 416 4874: 1.Annum tuition fee after scholarship is 800
2. Accommodation fee is 1200.
3. The registration fee is 750
08/11/23, 7:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $800.
08/11/23, 7:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
08/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
08/11/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
08/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 416 4874: So I'm not allowed to stay out of the campus for the first year? Because I was planning to stay with my sister Rutendo she is the beneficiary of Edoofa program with LPU University
08/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted
08/11/23, 7:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, If you don't mind can we address your query at the end, in this way we will discuss all the important details rest assured we will discuss the concern at the end.
08/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted madam, we can proceed
08/11/23, 7:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill
08/11/23, 7:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that [Name] will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted
08/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Very clear thank you
08/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome @263784164874, Now that we have established your tuition fee at $800 and accommodation fee at $1200, making his total annual education cost $2000, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
08/11/23, 7:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
08/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Yes it's clear madam and well noted
08/11/23, 7:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit your parents. Imagine that with your hard work you earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
08/11/23, 7:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2000. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2000 - $1000 = $1000, which will need to be paid by your parents.
08/11/23, 7:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
08/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 416 4874: It's clear and very helpful. I will give my best to work on the EWYL program
08/11/23, 7:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
08/11/23, 7:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2000 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after you arrives in India will be $2000 - $750 = $1250. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $625 and $625, with a six-month gap between them.
08/11/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Noted
08/11/23, 7:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on 22-Nov-2023*. I hope we are together so far?
08/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted madam
08/11/23, 8:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Yes explain further
08/11/23, 8:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 8:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *November 22nd,* 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted
08/11/23, 8:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 8:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Yes I'm in Harare
08/11/23, 8:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 8:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 8:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Well noted thanks
08/11/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
08/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 416 4874: Thank you I will be in touch with him
08/11/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

21/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Blessing, I hope you are doing well. 

I understand that you are facing some challenges with your bank, and I can see that the resolution time they have provided extends beyond the deadline. As of today, it's already the 21st of November, and the resolution time specified by the bank is over a month. 

Unfortunately Blessing, universities do not allow such extended timelines for fee payments, especially for international scholarships where students worldwide are competing for the same opportunities. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure being a wise student, you can understand the importance of adhering to the deadlines set by the university to secure your scholarship seat.

Additionally, since the university has provided a specific deadline of 22nd of November could you please let me know the amount of the fee you will be able to raise by that date?

On this note, May I please know the amount you will be able to raise by tomorrow?
21/11/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 416 4874: I opt to pay the full amount on 22nd of December which is my last due date to pay the installments
21/11/23, 9:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, Let me clarify that ideally the due date is 22nd of November but as you have been granted with the Endowment benefit which allows you to pay you registration fees in two installment with flexible payment plan.
