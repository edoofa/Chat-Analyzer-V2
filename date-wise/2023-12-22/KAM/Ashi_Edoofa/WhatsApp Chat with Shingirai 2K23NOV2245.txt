09/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
09/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/12/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am
09/12/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
09/12/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/12/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes
09/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
09/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am

11/12/23, 10:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us @263778640240, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/12/23, 10:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/12/23, 10:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/12/23, 10:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
11/12/23, 10:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/12/23, 10:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
11/12/23, 10:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, As I have looking forward for your response however as you have not shared your response with us.

13/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 864 0240: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shingirai, Wishing you a good day!

With respect to our last conversation, I would like to mention that the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Travel and Tourism)*. On this note, May I please know if you are available now for the session? <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am I'm available.
14/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Good afternoon ma'am .
14/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation dear, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
14/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
14/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
14/12/23, 3:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am
14/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am.
14/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
14/12/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $1000*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
14/12/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
14/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am.
14/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am.i have a question on this ma'am.
14/12/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please go ahead with your question dear
14/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Suppose if my parent doesn't have that amount required at that time  is she given another time frame or the scholarship will totally be cancelled.
14/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am.
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your query dear as this is the general thought anyone could have, although I still want to understand the reason why are you thinking that your parents won't be able to raise the amount for you registration, Could you please share it with us?
14/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Basically interms of their salaries, they earn low wages which they can not pay the required fee once in a very short space of time.
14/12/23, 3:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your honesty in sharing the above information with us dear, however regarding this concern we have an amazing solution which we will share in our session today. However, at the end if you still have any doubt, we will definitely assist you there. I hope you understand?
14/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am thank you.
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are always welcome dear,  Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 864 0240: In Zimbabwe due to financial constraints no one will even help with such large sums of money.
14/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am.
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
14/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am
14/12/23, 3:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
14/12/23, 3:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000= $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
14/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Oh I got you ma'am.i thought perhaps it should be paid no later than tomorrow.
14/12/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you have understood it dear. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/12/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/12/23, 3:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am
14/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am.
14/12/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ma'am am I coming to India in January or
14/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, You will come in India in the next year, most probably in the month of August
14/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am.
14/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am
14/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/12/23, 3:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/12/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am
14/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Greatly appreciated ma'am 💞
14/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am 😊
14/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you dear, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
14/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
14/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Sure thing! Here's a paragraph in response to the image:
"The image of the 2023 batch arriving has truly filled me with motivation and determination. Seeing the eager faces of these bright students reminded me of the responsibility we have to provide them with the best possible experience. It is an honor to be able to help these young people achieve their goals, and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so. I am committed to ensuring that our services are of the highest quality, so that we can help these students reach their full potential. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of these students, and I am proud to be an Edoofian.
14/12/23, 3:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Happy to hear that @263778640240
14/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Sure thing ma'am.
14/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
14/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
14/12/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
14/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am I'm done.
14/12/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Does it mean if I fail my A level I can still come to India for a diploma.
14/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok maam
14/12/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
14/12/23, 4:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am
14/12/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/12/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/12/23, 4:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am.
14/12/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3.*Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
14/12/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am.
14/12/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/12/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/12/23, 4:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 864 0240: No , ma'am.
14/12/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 864 0240: I know nothing may ,lead the way.
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
14/12/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Greetings to you Ma'am Ashi,l have been just following all of the conversation.lam just happy and contented with it.Sorry for a late responding prior to your greetings.
14/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am.
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to connect with you @263717497818 I appreciate that you are following with the discussion
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am and just following two steps behind you.
14/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ma'am does it mean that the diploma will be carried out there .
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/12/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok ma'am
14/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am
14/12/23, 4:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
14/12/23, 4:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
14/12/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
14/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Noted ma'am
14/12/23, 4:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 864 0240: $500-$1000
14/12/23, 4:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263778640240 Dear would be please elaborate?
14/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ok
14/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 864 0240: You have said that for a student to secure a scholarship he or she is required to pay a fee ranging from $500-$1000.
14/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 749 7818: From my own understanding,from what  was shared it's like that  it will depends with the University(ies)that would have responded and   it was given as an example.If lam to say for budgeting purposes as well.

Ma'am Ashi if l stand to be corrected it will be fine as well.
14/12/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263717497818, The above shared break up was for example, although it's true that one has to pay the registration fees in order to reserve their scholarship seat, May I know if there is any concern?
14/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Iam just following and l do understand the concepts as well.We may go ahead,it's quite open.
14/12/23, 5:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment.

21/12/23, 2:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Shingirai ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
21/12/23, 2:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
21/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Because in our country it might be a bit costly  to raise such amount at one time.
21/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am..at the moment Shingirai ',s mobile network is not getting through.
21/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Good afternoon Ma'am just happy to connect with you.Iam just following the conversation as well.
21/12/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to connect with you @263717497818
21/12/23, 5:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
21/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 864 0240: I'm sorry ma'am,I have been facing network challenges.
21/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 864 0240: I'm back .
21/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 749 7818: On the accommodation issue,lam suggesting off campus since l will not be able to pay that sum of $2000 at once.l think monthly payments will be fair for me.
21/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries @263778640240, I am glad to see that you are back now.
21/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Hope you are getting me well.It will be nice of you to connect us with some of the Edofians who are having that kind of living.So that will have a glance of the off campus accommodation that basically suits us.
21/12/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your thoughts @263717497818, i will definitely assist you with the same.
21/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 749 7818: I will be grateful Ma'am thank you so much.
21/12/23, 5:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are truly welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
21/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 749 7818: It's clear Ma'am .
21/12/23, 5:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
21/12/23, 5:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 3rd, 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
21/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am but the time frame is quite short ,can't we wait for other university admission approvals I think as time goes by I would have managed to raise the funds..
21/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Universities.
21/12/23, 6:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I understand your concern @263717497818, Let me share the payment plan with you and I will assist you with your concern please.
21/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Okay Ma'am you may go ahead,lam listening.
21/12/23, 6:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee.
21/12/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $650 of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 71 749 7818: It's clear Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I glad to hear that @263717497818. With this payment plan. May I know if there is any concern you would like to share with us?
21/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 749 7818: It's fine Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Kwekwe,Zhombe District.
21/12/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 6:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Ohk Ma'am noted with thanks.
21/12/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 6:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am will see the alternative that l will use.
21/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Maaam won't I have some difficulties since may surname is incorrectly spelt
21/12/23, 6:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
21/12/23, 6:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know dear, May I know what is the correction please?
21/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Noted with thanks Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Vunganai
21/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Ma'am could please connect me with other Edoofians.
21/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Who live outside the campus
21/12/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, I will help you connect with other edoofians please don't worry.
21/12/23, 6:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/12/23, 6:51 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Noted Ma'am.
21/12/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/12/23, 6:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 749 7818: l have understood on that Ma'am.
21/12/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/12/23, 7:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263717497818 May I know if we are still connected?
21/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 864 0240: Yes ma'am
21/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 749 7818: It is clear Ma'am Ashi
21/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 749 7818: Yes we are still connected
21/12/23, 7:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics.
