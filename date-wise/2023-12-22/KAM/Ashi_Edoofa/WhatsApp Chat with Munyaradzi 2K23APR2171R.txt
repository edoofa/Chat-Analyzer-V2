28/08/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with me, dear. They are well noted by the admission team. So, before we proceed may I know if you recall our recent conversation with the admission process session, and if you have any querries you can ask for the same, dear. <This message was edited>
28/08/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 363 5917: No queries
28/08/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs. May I know if you are ready, dear?
28/08/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes in ready
28/08/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We have some fantastic news for students like you who are currently navigating the admission process. This unique opportunity is time-sensitive and brings with it significant advantages for those who opt to finalize their admission ahead of schedule, specifically before your *A-Level/Grade-12* results are released. This can be achieved with the assistance of your statement of entry.

By making this early decision, you can position yourself to reap benefits that can reduce your cost of Higher Education. I hope we are on the same page here?
28/08/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes I'm ready
28/08/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes we are on the same  page
28/08/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear! I've reviewed the session you had with your counselor, and it's heartening to see the unwavering support your family is providing to help realize your dream of higher education.

While the pursuit of education is a significant achievement, it's important to recognize that it's not the sole responsibility your family bears. They have various other commitments and obligations, and over time, they might encounter certain challenges that they'll strive to manage without burdening you.
28/08/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, on behalf of your application, I want to emphasize that we're committed to assisting you not only during the enrollment process but also in managing your finances for university admission. Just as we facilitated your enrollment fee payments in installments, we're here to extend similar support for the admission process.

Speaking of which, there's an exciting Early Decision Benefit available for applicants for the 2024 intake. It's designed to provide advantageous terms for those who choose to make an early commitment to their admission process. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
28/08/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 363 5917: I wasn't aware
28/08/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I understand Munyaradzi, it is alright. So, basically under this program, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.*

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints. Isn't it?
28/08/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it is
28/08/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
28/08/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
28/08/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
28/08/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Tell me
28/08/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
28/08/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:
28/08/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. Get Early Access to Scholarship Seats in the Top Indian Universities with Edoofa.

2. Get an opportunity to keep your university fee structure as of the current batch of admissions.

3. Get an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. No Financial Pressure of making the payment in one go, there is an option of making the payment of the registration fee in 2 parts over a period of 30-45 days.

And for the students, who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, they get the following 2 benefits as well if they choose to get the early decision benefits:

5. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, an option to change the course to a Diploma Program will be given so that the student doesn't lose a year.

6. If a student fails to bring in a minimum of 2 passes in the A-level Examination, and neither wants to start a diploma course, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program.*

Are you clear on these benefits?
28/08/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
28/08/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:

1. Since you are yet to get your A-Level results, but when you connect with the universities for your admission process now, it makes you an early applicant. Here, you will be given a provisional letter of intent from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned after you complete your registration formalities when your result comes, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point.
28/08/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 363 5917: I get it
28/08/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. That is wonderful to hear, dear. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.

Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your bachelor’s education in India.
28/08/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
28/08/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
28/08/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 363 5917: It's OK
28/08/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I am glad to hear that. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
28/08/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes we are on the same page
28/08/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Network is not stable
28/08/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I am pleased to hear that. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving the option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 1st September 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 1st September 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 1st October 2024. Any queries so far?
28/08/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
28/08/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 5. That is great to know. Now, when your A-Level Results come and if you fail to bring a minimum of 2 passes, then it means, you will not be eligible to get admission for bachelor's courses anywhere around the world.

But, here at Edoofa, we all understand that due to several reasons such as poor teaching practices, the absence of better learning resources, and the impact of the COVID Pandemic, the students have not been able to give their best and adjust to the new methods of learning, so keeping the same in mind and to ensure the best for our students, we will get the students admitted to a Diploma course so that the student doesn't waste a year and have a break in higher education. Isn’t it a good solution?
28/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 363 5917: What if I pay once
28/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's a good  solution
28/08/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you can also do that as well.
28/08/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 6. Glad to know that. Here, it might happen that if you failed to bring 2 passes in your A-Level, you may not wish to pursue a diploma course, nor you may want to re-write your A-Level Exams or join a Bachelor's program.

So, this basically means that you want to put your Academic Career to a halt. In such cases, you will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee that you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects. Along with that, you will also be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program.
29/08/23, 5:46 am - +263 78 363 5917: Thats great
29/08/23, 6:30 am - +263 78 363 5917: Good morning to you aĺl
29/08/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Munyaradzi.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
29/08/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes I'm avaliable
29/08/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 363 5917: We can proceed with our session
29/08/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through all 6 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 6 points clear?
29/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 363 5917: I'm waiting
29/08/23, 9:02 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes they are clear
29/08/23, 9:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity.  I shall conclude our session for now and let us connect on Thursday at 12:30 PM. Have a great day, Munyaradzi.
29/08/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 363 5917: It's okay thank you
31/08/23, 4:50 am - +263 78 363 5917: Good morning  to you all
31/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
31/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Go ahead
31/08/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*
31/08/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
31/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 363 5917: 2 Proceed with the Early Dicision Benefits
31/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
31/08/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 05th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 20th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
31/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
31/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 363 5917: It's clear
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 363 5917: It's clear
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
31/08/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 05th of September, the deadline becomes the 20th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 05th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 20th of September 2023, making the second deadline the 20th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
31/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 363 5917: What if I pay the money once
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, you have the choice to pay the fees all at once as well.
31/08/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
31/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
31/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 363 5917: It's clear
31/08/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 363 5917: We may go on
31/08/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
31/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Ist part on early registration is on 2 phases $300 depending  on the dates and the second  one is standard one when one pays $750 once
31/08/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days.
31/08/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. With the standard admission process, as a student, you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
31/08/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
31/08/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
31/08/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *20th September* and *20th October*.
31/08/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines (*20th September* and *20th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Munyaradzi’s application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board? <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes you can go ahead
31/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Truly apply for me
31/08/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Munyaradzi's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by (*20th September* and *20th October*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
31/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes $600 it's readily  available
31/08/23, 3:28 pm - +27 81 379 1657: Yes we can go ahead
31/08/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Munyaradzi’s application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Munyaradzi’s higher education well.
31/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Okay thank you
31/08/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome parents and Munyaradzi. 

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa and from here I would be helping you in moving ahead with your admission journey and we will together be gong through all the steps. 

Now, I wanted to share an update with you that as soon as you gave the go-ahead to the team for processing your university application, we shared the same with the universities applicable for your course. However, since the universities have recently closed the admissions for the last year's intake, therefore, there is a slight delay in processing your application, hence, I would require you to be patient with the same and you can expect to hear from us in the coming days.
15/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 363 5917: It's okay
15/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 363 5917: I'm waiting  for your response

27/09/23, 7:07 am - +263 78 363 5917: Good morning everyone
27/09/23, 7:08 am - +263 78 363 5917: My mentor and admissions officer I have  alot of questions to ask
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Munyaradzi!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Okay
27/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 363 5917: There is an issue  of A level  results pending  tell me
27/09/23, 12:44 pm - +27 81 379 1657: Good day everyone
27/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 738 4002: I want to know when are you going to change the date of birth and year of my son munyaradzi shumba  which is wrong stated. He was born on the 25 _08_2003 but on his papers the date  is still remains 25_08 _2004.So how can this issue resolved
27/09/23, 12:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, we will get the date of birth corrected. For now, stay assured that we will discuss all the queries that you have moving ahead during our conversation. For now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 363 5917: 1.900
2.3yrs
3.$750
4.$300
27/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
27/09/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 363 5917: So is there  accommodation off campus which is cheaper
27/09/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 363 5917: On off campus is there  food and everything on $1200
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 738 4002: That's clear
27/09/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, there are off-campus accommodation options that can be more budget-friendly. For university-approved off-campus accommodations, which cost approximately $1200 per annum, this fee usually includes the cost of food and basic living expenses. It's a convenient option for students who prefer to have their meals provided.
27/09/23, 1:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes we are together
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Mai I ask about  transport  when staying  off campus.  Is the place near  to the campus
27/09/23, 1:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, I'm glad we're on the same page.

Regarding transportation when staying off-campus, all the off-campus accommodation options recommended by the university are conveniently located within a short walking distance from the campus. This means that students who choose to stay off-campus won't have to worry about long commutes or transportation hassles. You'll find that the proximity of these accommodations to the campus makes it easy to get to your classes, library, and other university facilities without any difficulty. I hope this is clear?
27/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 738 4002: Clear enough
27/09/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 738 4002: Yes I am clear on this
27/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 738 4002: Is it safe to stay off - Campus  in terms of security?
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this clears the doubt that you have here, right?
27/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
27/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Go on
27/09/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 363 5917: This message was deleted
27/09/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 363 5917: So this means  I'm going to pay $600
27/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes I will pay $600 on Saturday
27/09/23, 2:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
27/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 363 5917: What are the requirements on off campus
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well, can you please let me know what is it exactly that you wish to ask?
27/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Useful resources needed when staying of campus
27/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are no such mandatory requirements in order to live off-campus please. All the facilities are readily available near the accommodation facilities. I hope this is clear?
27/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
27/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 363 5917: And also what type of clothing is required
27/09/23, 4:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to clothing, may I know if you are asking about inside the campus or outside?
27/09/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Both
28/09/23, 5:37 am - +27 81 379 1657: Inside**
28/09/23, 10:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Munyaradzi!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:06 am - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier as by the time you had replied to me, we were already closed for the day. I appreciate your patience, so let us move ahead with our conversation here.
28/09/23, 10:10 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for clarifying that for me here. Now, on that note, when it comes to the clothing outside the campus, then in that case, it depends on your personal preference dear, which means that you can wear anything based on your choice and comfort. 

Moving ahead, coming to the clothing instructions inside the campus, then there are different uniforms for the student on the basis of their courses, hence, that would be informed to you once you will arrive here at the Campus. Is that clear?
28/09/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 363 5917: Yes let's move on
28/09/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 363 5917: Yes
28/09/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 363 5917: Can I ask something where it is written Pending A level result
28/09/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please let me help you in understanding the same here. When it is written that you would have to submit pending A-Level Results, it means that you would have to submit your results before you arrive here in India and complete your registration at the university campus, may I know if that is clear?
28/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes it's clear
28/09/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, moving ahead, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
29/09/23, 7:03 am - +263 78 363 5917: Everything is okay
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Munyaradzu!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
29/09/23, 10:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa. 

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.

13/12/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Munyaradzi ,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. I am pleased to connect with you today. In light of your admission process, I would like to share some exciting news with you regarding your admission process with the university. 

As we have shared with you earlier that your application is in process with Lovely Professional University, I would like to share that they have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
13/12/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
13/12/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
13/12/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities. 

If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!
14/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Okay thank you
14/12/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, Have a blessed day ahead!

20/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 363 5917: But at first  yu said galgotias
20/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Is there a change on the university
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening @263783635917
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them.
20/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yeah it's very clear
20/12/23, 7:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias University without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/12/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias University to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750 .

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750 , but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias University , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Yes so when is lovely profession university  will accept
20/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 363 5917: And how many universities  are there and there names
20/12/23, 7:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263783635917 We are not able to share the exact time as it is totally depend on the university.
20/12/23, 7:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once we get any response from the officials, we will definitely share the updates with you
20/12/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Okay have a goodnight
20/12/23, 8:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263783635917, Have a blessed night ahead!
20/12/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 363 5917: But for the Visa it's on April right
20/12/23, 8:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263783635917
20/12/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 363 5917: And schools will be opened when
20/12/23, 8:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263783635917 Ideally the academic journey will start in August, 2024 and we will start the Visa journey from April, 2024.
20/12/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Wow the amount  for the ticket
20/12/23, 8:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, Let me share that the flight tickets the prices varies on various factor however the approximate cost is $450-$550. I hope you understand.

20/12/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Okay when staying  of campus  how far in terms  of distance  from the campus
20/12/23, 8:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to share that the accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month.
20/12/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 363 5917: What about food
20/12/23, 8:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you are opting for off campus accommodation, in that case, you have the opportunity to cook your own food at your accommodation, which means you have the liberty to eat your home-cooked meals. It will cost the students a monthly expense of $40 to $50 to gather groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university, giving you affordability and convenience too. I hope I am clear on this?
20/12/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 363 5917: Okay there  are no people who cater for food on off campus
20/12/23, 9:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier.
