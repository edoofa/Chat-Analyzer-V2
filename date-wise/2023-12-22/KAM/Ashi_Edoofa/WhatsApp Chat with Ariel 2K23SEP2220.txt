Thank you
27/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message

27/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Waiting for this message
27/10/23, 6:58 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
31/10/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
31/10/23, 4:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
31/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
31/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
31/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
31/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
31/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
31/10/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
31/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
31/10/23, 4:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
31/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
31/10/23, 4:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
31/10/23, 4:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
31/10/23, 5:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263736856479 May I know if you have taken a note of above message?
31/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Noted sir
31/10/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263736856479. I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
31/10/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
31/10/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
01/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 73 685 6479: Noted sir
01/11/23, 11:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ariel, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to our yesterday conversation, I believe you had some challenges as you left the session in between, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions. 

Additionally, I would like to arrange a suitable time for us to reconnect and continue our session. Please let me know your availability, and we can plan accordingly to make our future interactions smoother and more productive.
01/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I think if we connect everyday at 3pm I will not have any challenges in our sessions
01/11/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, We will schedule our session at 3pm now onwards. On this note, May I know if you want to continue now or schedule our session for 3 pm?
01/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Let us continue now
01/11/23, 1:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263736856479. Once upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Currently no sir
01/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
01/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
01/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
01/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir we are ready
01/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
01/11/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263736856479 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
01/11/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
01/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I am glad sir
01/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
01/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
01/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
01/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
01/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I have reviewed all of them sir
01/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
01/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
01/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
01/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Excellent news
01/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
01/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
01/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
01/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
01/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
01/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
01/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
01/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
01/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes and there are no inquiries
01/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
01/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I am not aware please inform me of the process
01/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
01/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
01/11/23, 4:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
01/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
01/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
01/11/23, 4:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I agree
01/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
01/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Okay
01/11/23, 4:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes I am
01/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
01/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
01/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
01/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
01/11/23, 4:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
01/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I have no queries
01/11/23, 4:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
01/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes I am excited and ready
01/11/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
01/11/23, 4:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

01/11/23, 4:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome @263736856479
05/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Good day sir
05/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I have a question sir
05/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 73 685 6479: My Councillor said I am able to change the career I want until before payment of tuition fee so is it still possible to change the career I want

16/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a 4 years 6 months program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 9 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
16/11/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 2:36 pm - +263 73 685 6479: On campus is much preferable
16/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
16/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I am clear
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
16/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
16/11/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes sir
16/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Can I ask
16/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear, Please ask your query
16/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 73 685 6479: The total amount is $3400 per year for tuition and accomodation if I chose the two seater AC room right 
So according to edoofa I will pay half this amount which will be $1700 per yer total cost 
Am I right?
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me clarify dear, According to the offer letter shared by the University your Annual tuition fees is $1800. Regarding accommodation for 2- Seater AC Room with Food the annual cost is $2500, by combining both of the cost the total is $4300 which will be paid by the student. I hope that clear, could you please confirm?
16/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 4:32 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Excuse me sir
16/11/23, 4:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure dear
16/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 231 0325: How can we reduce this amount. It's on the higher side. What about having a single seater room to reduce accommodation
16/11/23, 4:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to reduce accommodation cost, You can surely opt for off-campus accommodation as it's more affordable. I hope you understand.
16/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 73 685 6479: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 4:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are absolutely right @263736856479, The total cost shared with you after reduction is $2000 - $3000, with the same note if you chooses off-campus accommodation your total fees will be $2800 which is under the shared range.
16/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 231 0325: Out of campus accommodation is it self catering or what
16/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Off campus is self catering sir how about food
16/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed, Let me share once again. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 231 0325: According to this msg off campus accommodation includes food and other basic living expenses. Clarify
16/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 231 0325: So total cost will be:
Tuition                   $1 800
Accommodation  $800
TOTAL                    $2 600

This am sure I can fight and make it

16/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 73 685 6479: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely correct @263772310325. Moving further, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 73 685 6479: No sir in chegutu
16/11/23, 5:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me in know @263736856479, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles Jerera FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

 If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
16/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 231 0325: Chegutu is 150 km from Harare. It's a small municipal town
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We understand @263772310325, you can use the above method for the payment, I hope that's clear,
16/11/23, 5:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 231 0325: This accommodation provides food and all living necessities. Clarify bcoz I don't want issues coming up along the way
16/11/23, 5:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263772310325 We also believe in this approach.
16/11/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 231 0325: Am in a meeting now. So you can discuss with Ariel. Will look at the discussions later tonight
16/11/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263772310325, Thank you for letting us know. I hope @263736856479 you are available for the session, could you please confirm?
16/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes I am now available
16/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Understood
16/11/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 6:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents.
16/11/23, 6:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 73 685 6479: Yes
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 73 685 6479: I have no questions
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263736856479. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
