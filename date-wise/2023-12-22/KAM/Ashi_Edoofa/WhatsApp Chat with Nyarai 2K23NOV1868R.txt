23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay sir
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes sir I have understood
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
23/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes you can proceed
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
23/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes sir

23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, Let's start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

Welly recieved and noted
Be Blessed!
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263788961515, Please make sure to go through the videos
23/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 896 1515: I will surely go through them
24/11/23, 8:01 am - +263 77 937 2267: Good morning to you all. My name is Godfrey Chiwara, the father of Nyarai Chiwara. As you requested about the Videos presented by Edoofa cofounders, l have gone through them and l would like to share my understanding about them.
24/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 937 2267: Video number 1
Firstly l would like to point out that this video is quite exciting, informative and educative.
The Video is being presented by the Edoofa cofounders. They are highlighting that it is a special video for all students who have just enrolled with Edoofa. They went on further to review the process for one to get to this stage of watching these videos which are registration and eligibility check. The cofounders referred the viewer to pictures of students who have successfully enrolled with Edoofa pinned on the wall they refer to as "Edoofa,s hall of Fame". They talked about smiles on those students' faces. They pointed out those smiles are not only about the students' gratitude but also about students' awareness that they have embarked on a life transforming educational journey. The cofounders also talked about the EWYL program and emphasized on that program to create students' independence. Independence is created by the program's potential to lighten the parents or guardian' burden on meeting their portion of the fees. The contribution can be reduced to zero if a student earns high credits.EWYL offers an opportunity to earn whilst one is learning.

The cofounders also talked about their experience when they visited Africa. African students face challenges in meeting the exorbitant fees for their education. The cofounders of talked types of students they encountered who are successful students and failures.  They found out that failures always blame their circumstances and do not have an open mind. Whilst successful students have an open mind  and are always willing to go an extra mile.

The cofounders also talked about lessons which could be learnt from what Steve Jobs did as a young man ( just 20 years old)  and with little education ( just a fifth grader).
 Steve jobs had a ambition to manufacture frequency calculators and had the courage to look for HP company's CEO number. He also had the courage to phone the CEO.  The CEO was impressed and offered Steve Jobs employment. The other lesson which could be learnt is that when you need something and you also want to succeed ask the experts. Edoofa has a lot of experts so you should be comfortable and your success is somehow guaranteed.
 
The cofounders concluded their presentation by highlighting two important things which are
1. One should always follow instructions.
2. One should always be open minded.

Lessons learnt are
1 have courage
2. Be open minded
3. Be independent
3. World is full of opportunities.
4. Follow instructions.
5. Always ask the experts.
6. Life is full of smiles if you do the right thing.
24/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 937 2267: Video number 2
 This again is a wonderful video presented by the cofounders. The video talks about Edoofa's vision and their expectations from students. 
 The cofounders share  the experience of one African student who chose not to follow instructions properly. The student ended up dealing with another asian agent who conned the student money. The agent promised to process the student's papers and advised the student that he had links with Chinese institutions. The student initial paid US$1000.00 and waited for three months but nothing happened. The student was further conned US$300.00 to rereoute his papers. The moral of this story is that students should follow instructions so as to avoid losing money and time.
The cofounders further share the two main problems which are being faced by students from Africa which are exorbitant cost of education  and employability. The cofounders said that their solutions to these problems which Edoofa provides have been curved out their knowledge acquired over more than 10 years invested in supporting students. Solutions they identified for the exorbitant cost of education are:
1. Provision of scholarship programs
2. EWYL programs which work together with scholarship programs.
 Solutions for employability are;
1. Carefully selected institutions which work with Edoofa.
2 like minded community of students who work together to solve challenges they face.
3. Acquisition of requisite skills by students as they learn through EWYL
4. Convincing high flying institutions to work with Edoofa. 
5 assisting students to make the right choices through a robust enrolment system and processes.

The cofounders also pointed out that there are many institutions in India which do not offer high quality education, are crooks and focus only on making money. They do not work with such institutions.  They also also pointed out that Eoofa' s purpose is not just to get a student enrolled with an educational institution in India; it is more than that.
 The cofounders also encouraged parents to    advise  their children about the harsh realities of life. Parents should build the student's right attitude. The student should take 100 percent responsibility of their lives
 
The cofounders also gave an imaginary example of a vast sea, a gigantic tank and a cup. They said that the vast sea represent the world opportunities and the tank and cup represents the student's capacity. A student from Edoofa is like a gigantic tank ready to hold the vast opportunities (water) from the world (sea). And other students are like a cup which does not hold much water or opportunities from the world or water from the sea.

Lessons learnt.
1. Have the right attitude.
2. Be open minded.
3. Trust Edoofa.
4. Follow instructions.
5. Edoofa has the potential to solve a student's problems.
6. World is full of opportunities which you can embrace if you have the right skills and values.
7.Edoofa guarantees employability. 
8. Always work with expects.
9. You may loose money and time if you do not follow instructions.
10. Take 100 percents responsibility of your life

Thank you for sharing your understanding regarding the videos with us @263779372267. I am delighted to see that you have collected such amazing insights, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
24/11/23, 11:28 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

25/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/KeHfM9pr5uwCrjsHolFbDT <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Nyarai Audrey Chiwara, and my EWYL group name is Nyarai EWYL23E0946. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey.

Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
25/11/23, 1:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
25/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay Sir !
Noted with thanks
25/11/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263788961515. I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA (Travel and Tourism)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes the information is correct we can proceed
25/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes I agree with you.
25/11/23, 2:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/11/23, 2:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes ,Mr Shashwat discussed everything above with us.
25/11/23, 2:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 641 6834: Yes Sir
25/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes sir
25/11/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/11/23, 2:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?* <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my  Mentor is Ms Aditi and she has scheduled my session for 28 November
25/11/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Aditi, and that a session has been scheduled for 28th of November. This is a significant step in your journey, and I want to express my heartfelt congratulations to you for taking this initiative.

Wishing you all the best as you begin this exciting chapter. May it be filled with learning, personal growth, and, above all, a genuine sense of accomplishment.
25/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes Sir !
25/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Thank you very much Sir !
25/11/23, 2:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263788961515. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Noted with thanks.
25/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 641 6834: For further clarity Sir ,,, we must be prepared to pay for University registration fee. . Is that so
25/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263716416834, You can start preparing your finances. Moreover, Let me help you understand that you don't need to pay the registration fee charges now, as you will receive multiple offers from the Universities and once you make your final decision regarding the university choice then we will apply for your admission at that time you need to pay the registration charges. I hope your doubt is clear, Kindly don't worry as we will guide you at every step and make sure that your admission journey is smooth.

I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

25/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 641 6834: Thank you
25/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Most welcome, The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/11/23, 3:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 641 6834: Thank you Sir
25/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
25/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
25/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 71 641 6834: I did
25/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/11/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
25/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Thank you for the information
We can procced
25/11/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 641 6834: Well explained,Sir. Thank you
25/11/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
25/11/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
25/11/23, 3:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/11/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 641 6834: Yes it does. Thank you
25/11/23, 3:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
25/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 641 6834: Noted sir
25/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?

25/11/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As Nyarai's parents, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 641 6834: Yes Sir, with open hands.
25/11/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes ma'am we can proceed .
19/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from LPU University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
19/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 896 1515: 1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
 -975USD
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
-4years.
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
-200USD
4. What’s the Registration fee?
-700USD.
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
19/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Soo does it mean it's the program fee.
19/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Written on the offer letter ?
19/12/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263788961515 Yes dear, It's your program fees
19/12/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU - <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
19/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay Ma'am it's clear now.
19/12/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
19/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 896 1515: If I may ask , it starts with how many seaters ?
19/12/23, 3:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, This is four seater room please
19/12/23, 3:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
19/12/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and they would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether they wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
19/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay what about off campus how many seaters and are they boarding houses sort of ?
19/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes , this is very clear .
19/12/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263788961515 The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Mostly, The student prefers two seater room however it still depends on the student choice.
19/12/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
19/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay Ma'am thank you . 
I prefer off campus .
19/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes I'm clear we can move on.
19/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 896 1515: ~Off campus~  correction on this I am opting for on campus accommodation thank you!
19/12/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 1st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
19/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes we are together ma'am but can pay the amount around 20 January. 
I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I have my siblings who are going to boarding school first week of January. My mother will be able to pay with her monthly salary which comes between 15 and 20 January.
19/12/23, 4:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern @263788961515, We will talk about the same soon. However, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes you can explàn ma'am.
19/12/23, 4:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 31st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of  January 31st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
19/12/23, 4:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *December 31st, 2023*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
19/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes it is clear Ma'am.
19/12/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/12/23, 4:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 896 1515: I stay in Waterfalls , Harare.
19/12/23, 5:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/12/23, 5:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/12/23, 5:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Thank you ma'am. 

I will contact him.
19/12/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.
19/12/23, 5:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
19/12/23, 5:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles..

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
19/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay Ma'am.
19/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Let me deal with Mr Rajan
19/12/23, 5:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, I am sharing the account details of Mr. Charles with you for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
19/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/12/23, 5:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, you can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Yes ma'am this is very clear .
19/12/23, 5:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 896 1515: May I ask , after the end of the semester what happens ,ie where do we stay and what do we do  waiting for the other semester .
19/12/23, 5:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me assist you here @263788961515, I'd like to provide assurance that despite the absence of classes during the semester break, the accommodation will continue to be available and accessible throughout the entirety of the academic year. This means that the student has the flexibility to either reside at their accommodation or explore the option of traveling in India or returning home during this break, knowing that their accommodation remains secure and open throughout their entire career.
19/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Okay thank Ma'am 😊for shading more light .
19/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 896 1515: Thank you **
19/12/23, 5:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome dear, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/12/23, 5:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
19/12/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/
