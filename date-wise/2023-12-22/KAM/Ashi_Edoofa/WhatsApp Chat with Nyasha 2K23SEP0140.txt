Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/09/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Clear indeed
11/09/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
11/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/09/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

11/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
11/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

11/09/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great day ahead.

12/09/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?
12/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I Just wanted to inform you that I'm done with the videos
12/09/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, In that case, you can share your understanding of the 4 videos and we shall reconnect today at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
12/09/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 019 5828: What I understood from the videos is that to become an edoffian one need to be teachable and open minded,also following instructions is very important to be part of edoofa program
12/09/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I also understood that edoofa is not there only to help with scholarship but to teach students employability skills through EWYL which is in every university under edoofa
12/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Through the same EWYL students can pay fees on their on
12/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I also understood that one need to fill the SOP (statement of purpose)as a way of interaction with many universities and is very important since it outline student's strengths,trait academic excellence and why one has chosen to persue his program at a certain university
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/09/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

12/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 019 5828: .

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
12/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

13/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 019 5828: From my research I find out that Shimla university works with Zimbabwe which means it can be easy to get a job after tertiary education from Shimla university and also Vignan university  offers better services  and lastly I have relatives at both varsities so it can be easy for me to know the place quickly.
13/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 019 5828: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I can understand where you are coming from Nyasha and indeed as a student, it is easy for you to fall in love with what you see on the internet and hear from your friends. I am sure with the research you made, you must have noticed that India is a country that has over 850 universities, and every university has its own eligibility criteria.

Indeed it is true, that there are universities that are connected with the Zimbabwean government, however, if you compare them in terms of quality of education then please I would like to let you know that there was a student who got admission to a small university in Amritsar and after he arrived in the university he later realized that the quality of education is not good, and hence we as your Admission Officers, guide you and will always recommend you universities that are better and with great quality of education.
13/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Okay understood
13/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 019 5828: *Question 2*

Its fast-paced work environment encourages employees to think creatively, experiment, and push boundaries - qualities that are essential for any engineer looking to make a meaningful impact in their field.

Moreover, working for a company like Tesla would provide me with the opportunity to work alongside some of the brightest minds in the industry, learn cutting-edge technologies, and contribute to projects with the potential to make a significant impact on society.

In conclusion, my dream engineering company is one that combines innovation, sustainability, and social responsibility - values that I believe are essential for building a better future for everyone.

 *Question 4*
Electronics and electrical systems are both related to the study and use of electricity, but they differ in significant ways.

Electronics is a branch of engineering concerned with the design, manufacture, and application of electronic circuits and devices. It deals with the manipulation of electric signals using semiconductors, transistors, diodes, and other solid-state components to create complex systems such as computers, telecommunications equipment, and control systems. Electronics involves the use of low voltage DC circuits and digital logic circuits, which enable precise control and processing of information.

On the other hand, electrical systems deal with the production, distribution, and use of electrical power. They involve higher voltages and currents than electronics and focus on the transmission and distribution of electrical energy for lighting, heating, and powering appliances, machines, and industrial processes. Electrical systems include power generation plants, transformers, motors, generators, and other complex equipment used in the delivery and consumption of electrical energy.

In summary, electronics deals with low voltage circuits primarily involved in signal processing, while electrical systems deal with high voltage power distribution and utilization for various applications. While there are some overlaps between the two fields, they are fundamentally different in their scope and applications.

 *Question 5* 

A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electrical charge. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material, called a dielectric.

When a voltage is applied across the capacitor, electrons flow from one plate to the other, charging the capacitor. The amount of charge that can be stored on the capacitor depends on its capacitance, which is determined by the size of the plates and the distance between them.

Furthermore,Once charged, the capacitor can hold the electrical energy until it is discharged. When a circuit requires a surge of power, the capacitor releases its stored charge rapidly, providing a burst of power to the circuit.

In addition, capacitors are commonly used in electronics for filtering, smoothing, timing, and many other functions. They can also be used as energy storage devices in some applications.

Overall, capacitors are essential components in many electronic circuits, allowing for efficient use and control of electrical energy.
13/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I will send question 1 after school when I get to the quiet place
13/09/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the SOP form and the academic interview questions, indeed I shall wait for your response to question 1.
13/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Ok maam

13/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 019 5828: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Good evening Ma'am the audio above is the answer to question 1
13/09/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 019 5828: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 5:57 pm - +263 78 019 5828: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 019 5828: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, may I know by when will you be able to share the statement of entry for A- level as well?
13/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Is it not the one
13/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Which one is the statement of entry maam
13/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Hello
13/09/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780195828 this is the letter of recommendation for the O - O-level result. The statement of entry for A- level must have been given to you by the school, which states the dates for the upcoming examination in November, for your A- A-level, may I know if you have it?
13/09/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Ok I have it by myself can I share now
13/09/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can share it.
13/09/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 019 5828: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
13/09/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
13/09/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Electrical Engineering for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
13/09/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
13/09/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
13/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I'm ready
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yeah true
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/09/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes
13/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 019 5828: You mean registration fee is paid before the results are out?
13/09/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, you are correct.
13/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Is it paid in instalments
13/09/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780195828 Yes please, we shall explain this in more detail as we move ahead with the discussion, please I would encourage you to be patient.
13/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Ok ma'am thank you
13/09/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
13/09/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
13/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
13/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
13/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
13/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
13/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
13/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
13/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/09/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Is the visa fee not on the 350 enrollment fee
13/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780195828 let me help you understand, the visa fee is not the enrollment fee, by paying the enrollment fee you are enrolling yourself in the Edoofa program, please.
13/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Ok so how much can be paid for the visa
13/09/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The visa cost would be $83, please.
13/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Okay
13/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 019 5828: So roughly how much can I spend before coming to India
13/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780195828 everything is planned step by step, I would encourage you to be patient please, everything will be explained to in detail as we move forward with discussion.
14/09/23, 5:46 am - +263 78 019 5828: Ok ma'am
14/09/23, 7:30 am - +263 78 019 5828: Good morning

14/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 342 8153: How are you maam
14/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I hope you are doing well too, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Hello I'm now available
14/09/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
14/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Available
14/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263780195828  may I know if you were able to go through my message above?
14/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 019 5828: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I was able ma'am
14/09/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
14/09/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
14/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes.. it is
14/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
14/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
14/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
14/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Not really
14/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
14/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
14/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
14/09/23, 9:47 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I'm done
14/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
14/09/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
14/09/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
14/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/09/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes maam
14/09/23, 10:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/09/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. Now moving forward. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
14/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Very pleased to know that now Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
14/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 78 019 5828: You my provide more information on that one
14/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
14/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
14/09/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
14/09/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
14/09/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
14/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes
14/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 7)*
14/09/23, 10:21 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes I do
14/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once your results come in 2024, you will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
14/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
14/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Very clear
14/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that now moving ahead.

2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
14/09/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
14/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
14/09/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Very clear
14/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
14/09/23, 10:30 pm - +263 78 019 5828: We may move forward
14/09/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
14/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 019 5828: They not and I would like to ask if there's a room for one to stay off campus
14/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please many of our Edoofians stay off campus, so please do not worry about that even this shall be covered as we move forward.
14/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Ok thank you
14/09/23, 10:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. We shall reconnect tomorrow at 02.00p.mm.
14/09/23, 10:36 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Ok have a good night ma'am
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you have a great night to you too.
14/09/23, 10:38 pm - +263 78 019 5828: You are most welcome
15/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Good afternoon maam
15/09/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 019 5828: We can connect
15/09/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Good evening
15/09/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well, may I know if you and your parents are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I'm available ma'am
15/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Hello
15/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
15/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 019 5828: They were happy about the benefits
15/09/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
15/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 019 5828: They are not available for now
15/09/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 019 5828: We can move forward
15/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
15/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
15/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
15/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
15/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
15/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
15/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 019 5828: My parents will show up by participating when they are available
15/09/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I am sure, they will catch up with the conversation soon when they are available.
15/09/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Go on
15/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 019 5828: True
15/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 01st of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
15/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
15/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
15/09/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
15/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, the deadline becomes the 01st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 01st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 01st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
15/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes we are
15/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
15/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Very clear
15/09/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that, Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
15/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Looking at the standard procedure the registration fee needs to be paid in full before due date which is the 15th day from the day I have received my offer letter
15/09/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Looking at early early registration the student is eligible for the early benefits which are : deduction of 150 dollars by edoofa and the remaining fee to be paid in instalments as follows first half to be paid within 15 day and the remaining in the following month
15/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
15/09/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 438 2784: You may proceed with the application process
15/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Very clear
15/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
15/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *01st October* and *01st November*.
15/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *01st October* and *01st November*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Nyasha's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
15/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 438 2784: We agree to pay in two parts as stated above
15/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Nyasha's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by ( *01st October and 01st November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
15/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

03/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 019 5828: Morning how are you
03/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
03/10/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha!

May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutes by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
03/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 342 8153: How are you sir thank you for the job well done
03/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 438 2784: How are you sir
03/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 342 8153: As a parent l have  understood the contents of the  letter
03/10/23, 1:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 019 5828: 1.   .$1225

2.    $1200

3.     $750
03/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 342 8153: $750 should be  paid within 15 working days
03/10/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1225.
03/10/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
03/10/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1250) = $2475.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1000) = $2225.
03/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Well informed
03/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Does it include the 750 registration fee
03/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. It does include the $750 registration fee please. Now, Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
03/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 019 5828: May you please give me 30 minutes to discuss with my parents
03/10/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure Nyasha, you can do that and then let me know.
03/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 019 5828: For me the three seater is ok
03/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 019 5828: I would like to ask if you are going to deduct the 150 on my registration fee as my early benefits as stated before
03/10/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, we are going to discuss that further. Moving ahead, You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.
03/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: In this case, as you want to opt for three-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2475 which can be paid in two parts of $1237 & $1238 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.
03/10/23, 2:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Noted
03/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Does it include health insurance
03/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 342 8153: Is registration fee paid  in two parts as communicated before
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we are coming to discuss that please. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/10/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 019 5828: We need to make sure we do not exceed the due date
03/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Well informed
03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear till here as well please?
03/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Clear
03/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2475 and so the balance fee becomes $2475 - $1000 = $1475 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure.
03/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
03/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 342 8153: May you kindly discuss the issue of registration fee since it's needed in a short space of time
03/10/23, 3:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to that now. It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.
03/10/23, 3:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: At the same time, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well - 

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee of $2475, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2475 - $750= $1725, and that can be paid in two parts of $862 & $863 at a gap of 6 months (August 2024/January 2025). 

Are we on the same page here as well?
03/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Will work extra hard
03/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 17th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 17th November 2023.*
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *17th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Quite interesting
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
03/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. Now, coming to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 342 8153: Clear sir  thank you
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Outside Harare sir
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you are planning to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Residing in Mutare
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood,but is there any other mode
03/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 342 8153: What are the charges if we want to deposit straight into university account
03/10/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, if you wish to pay directly into the university's account, then the charges will be informed by your respective bank please. I hope this is clear?
03/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
03/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
03/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
03/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 342 8153: I have the account for Charles Jerera so l shall sent the money through him
03/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
03/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 342 8153: Thank you sir
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Before we continue is it the only university which accepted my application
03/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well. I hope you are clear till here please? <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 342 8153: As a parent  our discussion on registration fee is clear you may move forward
03/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 019 5828: We may continue
03/10/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear till here please?
03/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Understood
03/10/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Gulzar Group of Institutes and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
03/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Now clear
03/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 019 5828: We may move
03/10/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Gulzar, you would lose out on the scholarship from Gulzar and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
03/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Yes please
03/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 342 8153: Thank you for the update
03/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 019 5828: May you please drop some pictures of GGI
04/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Good afternoon
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Good afternoon
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in some urgent meetings that came up. I appreciate your patience here.
05/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding the pictures of GGI, stay assured that I will do that moving ahead, however, for now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Clear
05/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 019 5828: Ok
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Gulzar without risking losing out on the scholarship.
06/10/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Gulzar to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Gulzar, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
