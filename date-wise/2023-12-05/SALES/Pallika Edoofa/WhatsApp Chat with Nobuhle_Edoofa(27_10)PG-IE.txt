30/11/23, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nobuhle, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
30/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 708 8302: Wow, it is wonderful that the scholarship program has been expanded to make it more accessible for students like me! I appreciate you explaining the details and providing all the necessary information. I understand the importance of maximizing my points to increase my chances of receiving a higher quantum of scholarship. I am confident in my abilities and am motivated to do my best. Thank you for all your support.
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
30/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 708 8302: You are absolutely right - studying abroad is a dream for many students in my country, and I am honored to have this opportunity. I have done some research on foreign education and have looked into various universities around the world that offer the courses I am interested in. I have not yet applied to any universities, but I am excited to start the process and make my dream a reality.
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 708 8302: I completely agree with you - employability is a major issue for young people all over the world. I appreciate you sharing this perspective and helping me to understand the difference between Scholarship Programs and agents who focus on university admissions. I would love to read the article you mentioned - I am always looking for ways to learn more and improve my understanding.
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 708 8302: I just took a look at the article you mentioned - it is very informative and eye-opening! It clearly explains the difference between scholarship programs and education agents, and how a scholarship program like Edoofa has an end goal of making me employment-ready and giving me a leg up in the competitive job market. I am now more aware of the benefits of a scholarship program like this and what I can gain from it. Thank you for sharing this! 😄
30/11/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
30/11/23, 3:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As you do not have Biology, so, please let me know your alternate career aspirations.
30/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 708 8302: Thank you for sharing this information - it is very helpful to know the specific requirements for studying different subjects in India. Since I do not have Biology, I am now considering other career options that are a good fit for me. I am interested in computer science, and I am thinking about studying software engineering or computer programming. Do you think these would be a good fit for me?

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 708 8302: Well, international students who do not have a scholarship in India can expect to pay a considerable amount of money for a comparable quality of higher education. This is because tuition fees and living expenses in India can be quite high, especially when compared to other countries. For example, a degree from one of the top Indian universities like the IITs can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 per year, not including living expenses. That said, I believe that the cost of higher education in India is still relatively affordable compared to other countries, especially when one takes into account the high quality of education and the range of opportunities that
04/12/23, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nobuhle, I appreciate that you have a researched for the same but Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

04/12/23, 1:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
