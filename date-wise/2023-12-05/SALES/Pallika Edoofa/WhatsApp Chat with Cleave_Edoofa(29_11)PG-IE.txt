01/12/23, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Cleave, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

01/12/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
02/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 602 7126: Greetings.. yes let's begin
02/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
02/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, You can also achieve that!!
02/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, 


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
02/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 602 7126: Am fine  ... How are you ..
02/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 602 7126: Thus the plan and with the Edoofa scholarship l believe it's possible
02/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 602 7126: 😱😱 what ? That is good news  ...indeed Edoofa scholarship is affordable and helpful to all ..
02/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 602 7126: So every student under the Edoofa scholarship get the chance to earn or work while doing school work ..
02/12/23, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Cleave
02/12/23, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
02/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 602 7126: Firstly the idea of earn while you learn, l love it  career counseling, it helps a student to follow the right path, travel guidance, visa and fee payment we really need guidance we cannot do it alone..most importantly the minimum scholarship of 50 _ 100%
02/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 602 7126: L have a question ma'am  .. What is the different between Sociology and Social work?
02/12/23, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Cleave, Certainly! Sociology is a social science discipline that studies society, human behavior, and social institutions. It analyzes patterns, relationships, and structures within societies. On the other hand, social work is a profession focused on helping individuals and communities enhance their well-being. Social workers often address specific issues such as poverty, mental health, and family dynamics, using a combination of advocacy, counseling, and support services. While sociology is more theoretical and research-oriented, social work is more practical and intervention-focused.
02/12/23, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on Earn while you learn and Career counseling session

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

02/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 602 7126: Thanks  sir  so sociology is better than social work even in terms of earning?
