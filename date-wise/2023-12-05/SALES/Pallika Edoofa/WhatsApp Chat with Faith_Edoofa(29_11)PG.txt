04/12/23, 2:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity.
04/12/23, 2:17 pm - +27 62 156 4995: K l understand no problem
