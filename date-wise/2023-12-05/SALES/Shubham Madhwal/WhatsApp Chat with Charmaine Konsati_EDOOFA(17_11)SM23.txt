What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? Every year more than 300,000 African students move out of their country for studies and only a very few of these students are funded or given scholarships by government bodies to pursue their programs abroad. However, through the famed Edoofa program, Edoofa has reserved seats with Indian universities and colleges for selected students who as a part of the Edoofa program are offered scholarships ranging from 50-100% of their tuition fees.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?I believe I deserve this scholarship because it will help me achieve my future plans and long-term goals. By furthering my education in business administration, I can work towards my career goals in the business. I aim to make a difference in my community by creating employment and this scholarship will absolutely be the difference-maker when it comes to affording the education I need to do that and give back in the future.

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!

You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
18/11/23, 10:48 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
