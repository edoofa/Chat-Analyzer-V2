Tomorrow we celebrate *Dusherra*, which is a Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of good over evil. Hence we will connect for our session on Wednesday at 10:00 AM CAT.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage and that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.*

04/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 892 0092: Good morning Sir
04/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 892 0092: My mother can't make it for the session...
04/11/23, 10:52 am - Shubham Madhwal: I understand please, I hope you and your parents have gone through the acceptance letter?
04/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 892 0092: Yes sir
04/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 892 0092: I have got few questions Sir about the enrollment fee
04/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 892 0092: We should deposit into Mr Shorwi's account right
04/11/23, 11:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please ask!
04/11/23, 11:30 am - Shubham Madhwal: Are we connected Glory?
04/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 892 0092: Yes sir
04/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 892 0092: My network is tripping a lil bit
04/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 892 0092: This was the first question Sir
04/11/23, 12:08 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me help you understand the same better
04/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
04/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 892 0092: 2
04/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
04/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
04/11/23, 1:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263779960030 So the program director would like to connect with you over a video call session on Monday, May I know when will you be available for the same?
04/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 12:00 PM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

07/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 996 0030: Ye sure l am back at home now we can begin thank you
07/11/23, 7:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263779960030 . As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Glory was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Glory”s potential. I firmly believe that if students like him/her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
07/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 996 0030: Noted sir
07/11/23, 7:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any ququestions you would like to ask?

07/11/23, 8:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 12 PM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
