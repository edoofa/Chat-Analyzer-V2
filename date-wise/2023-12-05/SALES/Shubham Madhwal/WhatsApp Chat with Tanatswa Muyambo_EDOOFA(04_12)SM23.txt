04/12/23, 11:22 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning
 
I am *Mr. Shubham*, The Senior Acadmecian at Edoofa. We also have with us *Mr. Jyotishman, Head Admissions Officer*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for *Tanatswa Muyambo*. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Tadiwanashe*, I hope I have contacted the right person?

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form which you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 507 6384: Okay
04/12/23, 11:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for *Tanatswa Muyambo*. Which was recommended to us by your friend *Tadiwanashe*, I hope I have contacted the right person?
04/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 507 6384: Yes. You have the right person
04/12/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Welcome to the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Tadiwanashe?*
04/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 507 6384: 1) I've always liked to study abroad ever since I was kid. But as I grew I understood that my parents could never afford tuition for schools that are abroad so I saw Edoofa as an opportunity to fulfill my dreams and get the best quality education.
2) I understood that Edoofa offers scholarship in India because of the robust education system   and is one of the leading countries when it comes to computer science
04/12/23, 12:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, 
I can see that you have a partial understanding of the Edoofa Program, during the course of the session ahead, I will help you and your parents to understand the program and the process to get enrolled for the scholarship in detail
04/12/23, 12:23 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Your application has been shortlisted for this prestigious opportunity and we expect you to go through all the information, and be transparent and active throughout the counselling session and Evaluation*

So are we good to begin your session?
04/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 507 6384: Yes we are. But one more thing. Year of admission was supposed to be August 2025 because August 2024 I wouldn't have finished writing my final examinations
04/12/23, 1:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you see, taking a decision to study abroad is a huge step towards your successful career,  Therefore, it is highly essential that your parents are also a part of our counselling discussions as it requires their support as well. *Kindly add them to the group and notify me once done, I will be making you the group admin*. In case they are not available right now they can still be a part of the group and catch up with the conversations later.

*Please let me know once you have added them*

04/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 507 6384: Can I delay this. My parents thought it will be best if I did this after I write my final exams
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So you do not wish to proceed with the program until your eams are done?
04/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 507 6384: Yes. I'll have to wait till I finish
