God Bless You!
02/09/23, 10:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Mr And Mrs Chinyemba @263789792529, How are you?
02/09/23, 2:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Monday at 10:00 am CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. 

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

04/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good Evening Parents
I understand that you are occupied with work, But this is really disrespectful to me and to this scholarship opportunity itself, I have been trying to communicate with you for the past entire 2-3 days and there has been no response on your end even though you have read my messages.
04/09/23, 4:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *I personally feel there is actually something that is concerning you because of which you are not participating, And I am still willing to assist you with a solution if you wish to continue ahead and get your child enrolled in the Edoofa Program*
04/09/23, 4:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Otherwise, I am not forcing the scholarship opportunity on you at all, *If you do not wish your child to proceed ahead and succeed with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity then please come forward and confirm so that I can provide a formal closure to your application!*
07/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 979 2529: we want him to proceed
