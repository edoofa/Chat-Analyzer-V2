Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
18/10/23, 12:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
18/10/23, 12:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
18/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 367 8482: it sounds great and indeed a welcomed program to us

We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already.

19/10/23, 11:03 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted Please, Thank you for letting me understand the same!
19/10/23, 11:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: Mining engineering is a field of engineering that is concerned with the extraction and processing of minerals from the earth. It is a field that has been around for centuries and is currently experiencing a resurgence due to the increased demand for materials such as metals, minerals, and oil. However, due to the changing nature of the world’s economy, it is unclear whether mining engineering will remain a viable field of study and profession 10 years down the line.
19/10/23, 11:05 am - Shubham Madhwal: One of the primary reasons why mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line is the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources. With the world’s reliance on fossil fuels decreasing, there is less need for the materials that mining engineers specialize in extracting and processing. Furthermore, the increasing focus on environmental conservation has also contributed to this shift, as the extraction of minerals and materials can often have a negative impact on the environment.
19/10/23, 11:06 am - Shubham Madhwal: In addition, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields such as computer science and mechanical engineering may also lead to the decreased relevance of mining engineering. As technology improves, these other fields are becoming more efficient and effective in the development of new products and services. This increased efficiency and effectiveness can lead to a decrease in the demand for materials that are extracted and processed by mining engineers.
19/10/23, 11:06 am - Shubham Madhwal: Finally, the increasing cost of labor may also be a factor in the decreased relevance of mining engineering 10 years down the line. As the cost of labor increases, it becomes more difficult for mining companies to remain profitable. This can lead to mining companies cutting back on labor costs, which can reduce the demand for mining engineers and other professionals in the field.
19/10/23, 11:06 am - Shubham Madhwal: In conclusion, mining engineering may not be successful 10 years down the line due to the increasing shift towards renewable energy sources, the advancement of technology in other engineering fields, and the increasing cost of labor. As a result, mining engineers may need to look for other opportunities in order to remain relevant and successful in the future.
19/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 367 8482: thank you for us giving a clear vision on the field that he is interested ,what option do have if to suggest that you can advice him which is related to this

19/10/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
19/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 73 875 6176: yes sir Am very much ready to dedicated My TIME  abd everything l have in order ti transform My career for me the sky is the beginning so l Am willing
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
19/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 73 875 6176: yes can you please  enlighten me

20/10/23, 10:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
20/10/23, 10:54 am - +263 73 875 6176: from my RESEARCH studying in India costs between $3300 and $7800 for international students
20/10/23, 11:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
20/10/23, 11:00 am - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
20/10/23, 11:01 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

25/10/23, 7:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
25/10/23, 7:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
25/10/23, 7:33 am - +263 77 367 8482: The program sounds very interesting but how does a student balance his time ,will working not demand much of their time
25/10/23, 7:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/10/23, 7:38 am - Shubham Madhwal: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 7:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
* How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer - by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

25/10/23, 7:43 am - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?* <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 387 0363: This is a great program sir
25/10/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 387 0363: Yes it will benefit me
25/10/23, 8:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
25/10/23, 8:39 am - Shubham Madhwal: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

25/10/23, 8:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
25/10/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 387 0363: Yes this is different and is something I have being hoping for
25/10/23, 9:45 am - Shubham Madhwal: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.

Alright Tendai, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education, is that correct?
25/10/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 367 8482: yes
25/10/23, 11:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 11:17 am - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
25/10/23, 2:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
25/10/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 2:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
25/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Oky
25/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
25/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
25/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
25/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
25/10/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
25/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Oky
25/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
25/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).
25/10/23, 2:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
25/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Okay
25/10/23, 2:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great so I have an assignment for you, No need to panic as the answers to every question is resting in this chat itself, so make sure if you don't know the answer find it from the chat and then write it down

1.      Edoofa's vision and benefits if you're eligible?


2.      Cost of Education in India and the course which you're applying for and Why do we recommend India for higher education?


3.      Enrollment Fee payment timeline including the deadline period and how much to pay,  and when you've to pay?

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program former students of St. David's Bonda which also happens to be our associate school, they are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, she would be the right person to help you clarify how the Edoofa scholarship program has assisted her and how it was possible for her to cater towards international education for both her children at the same time. Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

06/11/23, 4:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So a re there any questions you would like to ask?
06/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Fine sir how are you
06/11/23, 4:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I am doing great please
06/11/23, 4:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
06/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Yes
06/11/23, 5:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fees payment deadline mentioned in Tendai's acceptance letter?
06/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 73 875 6176: 10 November
06/11/23, 6:36 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And do you know about the transaction methods as well?
06/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 73 875 6176: No we need help on that sir
06/11/23, 6:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
06/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 73 875 6176: Is possible to brief us on both methods just in case
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738
06/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 73 875 6176: Okay how do we confirm the payment
06/11/23, 6:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You can share the transaction slip here with me in the group so that I can get it confirmed by the accounts team
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 73 875 6176: Okay sir and thank you for the help
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are there any other questions?
06/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 73 875 6176: No sir for now l think l have all the answers l needed to know thank you if we have any we will let you know
06/11/23, 7:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted
So are there any questions that your parents would like to ask?
06/11/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Thank you sir all for now have been answered.
Once again thank you so much
07/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 73 875 6176: Hello sir
07/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 73 875 6176: We are fine
07/11/23, 4:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
07/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 12:00 pm CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
08/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 387 0363: Hello sir
We are all fine
08/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 387 0363: We are available
08/11/23, 12:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please, Why were you inactive for your session yesterday?
08/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 387 0363: At our place here we always have a problem of network sir
08/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Very sry yesterday  there was no network
08/11/23, 12:56 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Is the issue now resolved?
08/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Resolved but anytime it will disrupt  or no networking at all. It's by chance and these days it's raining
08/11/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I understand please
08/11/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
08/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Yes sir we are available
08/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, @263773870363 , Tendai's enrollment fee payment deadline is on the 10th of November 2023, May I know the progress for the same so far and when would you be proceeding ahead with the formalities?
08/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Thank you sir yes  at present we managed to get $80 USD and I hope  by Friday we are going to make the first payment
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 387 0363: We are left with $20 of which we are working on it
08/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263773870363 , you see the only reason I was seeking an update from you was. since I am well aware that in Zimbabwe there are severe Network Issues in Zimbabwe in a lot of regions because of which the bank sometimes faces server issues so in the past there have been parents who had to miss their deadline because their fees couldn't be completed on the same day of the due date, Instead, it took additional 2-3 days which delayed the overall progress of their child's admission.
08/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As your counsellor, I can only recommend you to try and complete the formalities a day or two prior to the deadline so that such issues are avoided and you as parents do not have to be stressed regarding the same!
08/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So if I may ask so far do you need my help with anything, please?
08/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Yes sir if l pay tomorrow is it ok
08/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 387 0363: Tomorrow morning at around 8 in the mng

10/11/23, 8:26 am - +263 73 875 6176: Morning sir sorry for the late reply and for not being able to attend the session the past few days we couldn't gather the exact amount of money to pay for the program it is due to the on going economic situation in Zimbabwe but we  managed to get only 90 dollars but if by any chance is it possible for me to get a new deadline in order for us to gather the full amount
