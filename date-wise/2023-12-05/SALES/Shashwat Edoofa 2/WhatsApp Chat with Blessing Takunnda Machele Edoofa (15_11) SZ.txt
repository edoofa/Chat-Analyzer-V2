So shall we start the session?
16/11/23, 9:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 468 2738: How are u sir you can start the session very much appreciated .
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Glad to hear that, I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent.

Kindly share a bit about yourself, what you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your son ahead for education. Additionally, you can add more about your family like the number of children, details of your spouse, etc.

Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
16/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Alright Felex Machele originates from rural Zaka district under Masvingo Province. I turned 53 years this year. Is a father of 3 children and Blessing being the last born. Highest qualification is Diploma In business management. Left civil service in 2015 . Since then it's proving quite a challenge to push my boy through his education.
As for Blessing I am really challenged by his performance in school. From my analysis he has so much zeal that to me is a self starter when it ,comes to school work.
So my worry is whether he will reach his destination. I read a lot of potential in him that I am unable to support.
16/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Currently I am helping my spouse Emily who is running a small child care project. Small as it is, we have food on the table. In short that's myself and family.
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I commend you both for your remarkable dedication and contributions, Mr. Felex. Your highest qualification, a Diploma in Business Management, reflects a commitment to personal and professional growth. Leaving the civil service in 2015 and transitioning to support Mrs. Emily in running a small childcare project underscores your adaptability and commitment to community welfare! I have confidence that Blessing is an exceptionally diligent student, and he will undoubtedly demonstrate his capabilities if given the right guidance! So, could you kindly tell me how much *St Anthony's High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports Blessing's education?
16/11/23, 11:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 547 0092: Aah sorry for the inconvenience. I got tied up and my battery went flat when there was no electricity.
Frankly Blessing school fees has not been easy to pay. St Anthony is charging 440 USD per term for boarding and tuition fees.
 My daughter is also training as a teacher at a local teachers college and we pay around 200 USD per term. So the fees issue has never been smooth sailing.
For Blessing the past 2 years his fees was being paid for by government social welfare program but unfortunately it doesn't cater for boarding school fees.
We felt we could disturb his career path since his former school was not competent enough in Advanced level sciences.
So that's how we came up with the decision to move him to St Anthony.
17/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 547 0092: In short Emily's project is the backbone of our children 's education though it can't stretch farther enough to tackle university fees.
17/11/23, 11:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." – Sam Levenson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
17/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 547 0092: Ok
17/11/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 547 0092: Let's begin our session
17/11/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Felex!
17/11/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting Blessing's education abroad?
17/11/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Ok like I have outlined above I can only finance up to the current levels that I am giving. Otherwise anything outside this I find it practically impossible. Hence looking for this kind of sponsorship
17/11/23, 1:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
17/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Ok  I hope I got your explanation and clarification between the two. Anyway my point remains that my ability to sponsor my son to study abroad remains limited. However I believe we need to go through the process. If accepted then  we will see whether the related expenses are within our reach.
17/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your concerns, Mr. Felix. As I have mentioned before, *Edoofa* offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. However, after the scholarship, there is some miscellaneous amount. May I know whether you will be able to help Blessing with that amount, please?
17/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Certainly yes I need to sacrifice for what is best for him .
17/11/23, 3:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Felex and Mrs. Emily. You are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and your dedication to Blessing's well-being is truly admirable!
17/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 547 0092: We appreciate, thank you sir
17/11/23, 7:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, before we move ahead with the course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind sending your son abroad for higher studies? Moreover, please share pictures of his previous qualifications results for evaluation. Also, please mention the year of completion of A level?
17/11/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 468 2738: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 547 0092: The whole issue of him furthering his education abroad is motivated mainly by opportunities that usually come with interaction at international level.
Whereas our education standards are reasonably competitive exposure to advanced technology in the sciences field is one of the push factors.
In the same vein the majority of our country"s young generation are planning their lives with a global view. I thus feel I need to support his vision by all means possible.
17/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 547 0092: The above results are in respect of his Ordinary level. This year he is in his lower Advanced level. He is completing Advanced level November 2024
17/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mr. Felex! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
17/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say that Blessing has obtained impeccable grades, Mrs. Emily!
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please share his previous term results as well?
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 468 2738: Unfortunately he has gone with his school report  at school
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mrs. Emily. Can you please share the results in a textual format?
17/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Unfortunately he took his school report back to school since it's a booklet that covers the whole year. Will send him this message so that he can share with us
17/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 468 2738: I cant recall offhead let me ask him to send the results .
17/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you very much, Mr. Felex and Mrs. Emily. Your co-operation is highly appreciated! In the meantime, can you please share his A-level subject combination? <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 468 2738: Ok he is doing Mathematics Biology and Chemistry
17/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
17/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding his career aspirations more vividly?
17/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 468 2738: From the very time he embarked on science subjects he has clearly shown his ambition to take up Medicine. Otherwise we had suggested other options within the medical field but for now we accepted his intentions to be a Medical doctor. He sees himself as a specialist doctor already
17/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mrs. Emily, could you please share why Blessing didn't pursue Physics in his A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
17/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 468 2738: In Zimbabwe if u want to persue medicine that's MBC
17/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
17/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 468 2738: Usually physics are taken by those in engineering
17/11/23, 9:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, Mrs. Emily.
17/11/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Ok surely that's a slight difference in the two education systems. I hope that won't be a critical impediment
17/11/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Alright alright I realize I hadn't critically interpreted it. Can I guess it implies he doesn't qualify for a Medical course in India🤷‍♂️
17/11/23, 10:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Felex. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Blessing's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
17/11/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 547 0092: I would be greatiful if you can share the options available in line with his combination. Maybe we may help him to realign his focus if need be.
17/11/23, 10:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that he could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
17/11/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 547 0092: Firstly if you can give a brief on Medical laboratory technology
17/11/23, 10:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Felex. May I know what fascinates you regarding the course, please?
17/11/23, 10:41 pm - +263 77 547 0092: It's that Laboratory scientists are highly regarded and for now they are on demand even within our local industry.

So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
