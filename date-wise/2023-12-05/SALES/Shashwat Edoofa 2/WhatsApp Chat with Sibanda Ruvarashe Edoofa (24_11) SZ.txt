I did my Ordinary level at Goromonzi high school in 2020 and i came up with 4 subjects English,Maths, Geography and Shona and then i supplemented History and Science in 2021 at Kenville High School so as to increase my subjects 

Then after that i decided to proceed and i went to High School to do my Advanced level which form 6 in 2022 and i finished this and im apparently waiting for my results because i finished my exams this month.My combination was History, Family and Religious Studies and Literature in English.

Im interested in studying politics or law in my tertiary education.I have been ambitious about advocating for people, being the voice of the voiceless since i was a child

My hobbies:i always spent the most of my time helping people with online lessons, reading news, watching movies sometimes 

My mother only did her Ordinary level and she is now working as a photographer

So i stay with my mom and siblings right here in Zimbabwe and my dad passed away when my mom was three months pregnant with me

29/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 878 9716: I am a photographer and my highest qualification is Ordinary level certificate
