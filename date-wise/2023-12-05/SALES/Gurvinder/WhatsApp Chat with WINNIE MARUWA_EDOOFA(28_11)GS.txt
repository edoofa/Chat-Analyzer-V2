29/11/23, 9:28 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Mrs.Pamela Ndawona!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
29/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 164 7225: Okay Mr Singh. We can proceed.
29/11/23, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs.Ndawona,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs.Ndawona, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Hester, is that correct?
29/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 164 7225: Yes
29/11/23, 9:46 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Hester, also do tell me whether you learnt about Hester’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/11/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 164 7225: I have not learned of Hester’s experience with the Edoofa program
29/11/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program.
29/11/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/11/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/11/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/11/23, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for Winnie so that just like these students she can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards her higher education byherself and help you parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 164 7225: That’s sounds like what we are really looking for.
29/11/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs.Ndawona, as we start your daughter's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
29/11/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 164 7225: Yes noted
29/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 164 7225: Yes I believe so
29/11/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Alright so Mrs.Ndawona, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a parent, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish Winnie to study, her strengths, her weaknesses, her hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do you work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do you specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
29/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 164 7225: I’m a 41 years old wife and mother of two daughters Winnie being the first one. I’m currently working as a small scale chicken farmer in a rural area called Mhondoro in Mashonaland West in Zimbabwe. I did high school up to “O” level. I studied beauty and specialized in nails 15 years while living and working in South Africa. We relocated to Zimbabwe end of 2022.
29/11/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/11/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: So Mrs.Ndawona, could you kindly tell me how much *RIO ZIM MHONDORO HIGH* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
29/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 164 7225: The fees are $110 USD per term. My husband and I take care of the finances from our chicken business
29/11/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you did not mention what Winnie would like to study, could you please share that?
29/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Sorry I missed that. She would like to Law
29/11/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/11/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 164 7225: No
29/11/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share Winnie's O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
29/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Winnie was born in South Africa where she did Grade 1 to 11. When we came to Zimbabwe she carried on to form 5. Which she achieved 3 points for History, 3 points for English Literature and 5 point for Family and Religious Studies.
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 164 7225: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 164 7225: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: And may I know the reason you shifted to Zimbabwe? <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 164 7225: The South African Home Affairs would not grant citizenship to children born to Zimbabwean parents who are on temporary visas. For that reason Winnie could not register to write her Matric this year.
29/11/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
29/11/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding Winnie's interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
29/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 164 7225: That’s great thank you
29/11/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
29/11/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Winnie achieving it.
29/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 164 7225: I’m sorry I forgot to mention that the above points were from last term. We are surely looking forward to better result this term. And yes Winnie has always been a top scholar
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
29/11/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now should I brief you about the course?
29/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes please
29/11/23, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law. It covers subjects related to Arts field such as Economics, History, Sociology and Political Science etc. alongside specialized fields of law like Criminal Law, Corporate Law, Patent Law, Administrative Law, Tax Law, International Law and Labor Law.

The students having an ability to draft formal documents with precision are perfect for this course. This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.
29/11/23, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
29/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you for the information
29/11/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
29/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes I understand
29/11/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
29/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Provided the career option, 5 years after the completion of the course, I see myself having achieved and still achieving my goal of prosperity, hard work and significant growth within my desired career. I definitely do not want this course to feel as if I have worked towards a job but I want, after the completion of the course, to know that I have worked for a career I aspire to thrive in. This career option is simply not an option but a passion. This passion, after the completion of the course, will grow and this will only drive me to achieve my dream of being an independent, self reliant woman who will later launch her own practice and that will be the symbol of the work she did in the course leading to her career. If I were to get in to the EDOOFA program it would enable me to get out of my comfort zone, try new ways of solving problems, create possibilities for me not only for my career but also for my life.

29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer.
29/11/23, 2:32 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 164 7225: I must say I do
29/11/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
29/11/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

29/11/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mrs.Ndawona, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
29/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 164 7225: The issue that Winnie doesn’t have O level and she learned in South Africa and finished off in Zimbabwe will not affect her?
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Gurvinder: No Mrs.Ndawona, then just send me her term results of form 5.
29/11/23, 4:44 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Alright then. We will collect them on Friday morning
30/11/23, 8:23 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the key that unlocks the golden door to freedom.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

30/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 164 7225: This is very reassuring. Thank you.
30/11/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Ndawona, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
30/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes. It has been really insightful
30/11/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs.Ndawona, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe you and your family members would be the ones who would be supporting Winnie for her higher education.
30/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes we are the ones to take care of it Mr Gurvinder
30/11/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
30/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes I am
30/11/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Ndawona as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/11/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you for your time.

02/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes I totally understand. I’m also saying we wouldn’t be able to pay that without assistance.
02/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you 

Have a great weekend
04/12/23, 8:03 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
04/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 164 7225: Okay. 👍🏾
04/12/23, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs.Ndawona, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/12/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you.
04/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
04/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you think so?
04/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes it is. It’s also convenient.
04/12/23, 1:12 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you!
04/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Ndawona basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
04/12/23, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: However Mrs.Ndawona, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Thank you. This is very helpful and also convenient
04/12/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 164 7225: No. Not really
04/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs.Ndawona, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
04/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 164 7225: I do understand the process.
04/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 164 7225: How long do these phases take in total?
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: 1-2 weeks considering how active you are in the sessions.
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: @263781647225 Can you please be active for 2 mins more.
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 164 7225: Yes
04/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
04/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
