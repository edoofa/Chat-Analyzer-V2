You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 901 8933: The Pleasure is mine,

It's nice to connect with you all
01/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Shaloam, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Nontokozo, is that correct?
01/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 901 8933: Yes
01/12/23, 11:33 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Nontokozo, also do tell me whether you learnt about Nontokozo’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
01/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 901 8933: I didn't really learn anything about the Edoofa program but I did share a little bit of Nontokozo's journey and Experience with the Edoofa program with her,
01/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program then.
01/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
01/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
01/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yes of cause sir, that is exactly what am looking for
01/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 901 8933: This is really great and impressive
01/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Shaloam, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
01/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
01/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
01/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 600 5722: Hello its Sibongile Mvitsho Shaloam's  mother

01/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Shaloam, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

04/12/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 901 8933: First of all, if I get into the Edoofa program, I will be able to study without worrying about tuition fee, accomodation and all, this will enable me to be fully focused on my studies and my dreams, and once my mind is set on achieving something, I make sure I definitely achieve it,

The Earn While You Learn program will also help with the small stuff that I might need, 

As for where I see myself after 5 years of completing the course, let me start with immediately after I finish the course, I would obviously look for a well paying job, and save a percentage of my monthly salary, while making a business plan,

I would probably do that for the whole of the first year and the second year, depending on my salary,

Then,I will open my business, also depending on the type of business I would be interested in, whether I will buy shares in a very reputable company, or franchising, or open my own business, 

If all goes well, I would want my business to be up and successfully running in atleast a year or a year and a half, 

Then, after that I would make sure to achieve all my dreams, and also, since I would be a proud Edoofian, how else can I thank the Edoofian family than to also help in the insuring of scholarships to students that would be in the same situation as I am in now, which would be five years ago, by then....
04/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Shaloam, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Of cause sir, this is something that I have planned for a very long time, I cannot let my dreams to shatter just like that
04/12/23, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 901 8933: What would assure that I achieve my dreams than an Internationally recognised degree, 
To get a good paying job, I have to have experience and skills that every company would want to have as their own, skills that will set my company aside from any other,
If my company has a good reputation, I would obviously get a lot of investors and customers, also, from the experience that I would get from another country, I would be able to know the type of people I want as employees to manage my business in an extra ordinary way, and besides that, am just a person that loves socialising and adventure,
04/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 901 8933: I never really thought about that, but you have given me food for thoughts, this is really something to think about
04/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Yes do share your thoughts.
04/12/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 901 8933: There's a girl who is the former Head Girl of our  school, she gives free extra lessons to A'level students doing the same subjects as she did too, I think I would also do the same or have a program like Edoofa that will offer scholarships to students
04/12/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Shaloam, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.

04/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 901 8933: This is great
04/12/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Shaloam, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yeah, this is really great work that you are doing
04/12/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 901 8933: I know a little about it from Nontokozo, but I would like it if you tell me more about the program
04/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Shaloam, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 901 8933: This is very impressive
04/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 901 8933: This is really great, so the scholarship credit that they get, they can use it for their own personal use, or it is only for just in case they cannot pay the annual fee completely
04/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: The scholarship credits can be used by you just to pay your University fees.
04/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Ook I understand
04/12/23, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yes it is, atleast with the Earn While You Learn program, I will not solely rely on my mother for the tuition fees
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Shaloam, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
04/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yes I understand very well
04/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Shaloam, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yes that's true
04/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
04/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Not really
04/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
04/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Am ready
04/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Shaloam, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 901 8933: $1500-$2250
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Shaloam, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 901 8933: I understand
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you think so?
04/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yes of cause
04/12/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/12/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Shaloam, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.* <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: However Shaloam, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yeah that is very impressive,
04/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
04/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Not really
04/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Shaloam, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
04/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in ZImbabwe itself.
04/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 901 8933: Yes I did, thank you
04/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
04/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
04/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
04/12/23, 7:12 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
