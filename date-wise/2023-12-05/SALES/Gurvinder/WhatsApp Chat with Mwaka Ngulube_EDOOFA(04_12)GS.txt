04/12/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Mwaka, and Mrs.Harriet Hamikondo!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
04/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 8806769: Good afternoon Mr Singh
04/12/23, 2:10 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs.Harriet Hamikond,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
04/12/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou noted Mr Gurvinder
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 5285124: Good Afternoon Mr. Gurvinder Singh
04/12/23, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mwaka, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Edwin, is that correct?
04/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes
04/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Edwin, also do tell me whether you learnt about Edwin’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - +260 97 5285124: I didnt really learn much about it from edwin. I also havent learnt of his journey and expirience yet
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright sir
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/12/23, 2:47 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes, i would like that
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mwaka, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/12/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes i do
04/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mwaka, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
04/12/23, 3:00 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou for the feedback this given about Edoofa
04/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: My pleasure.
04/12/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright...when do i have to submit it to you?
04/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Right now.
04/12/23, 3:06 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright
04/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
04/12/23, 3:31 pm - +260 97 8806769: Yes we are. Mwaka is currently summarizing the questions asked. Thanks
04/12/23, 3:50 pm - +260 97 5285124: My name is Mwaka Ngulube. Im sixteen years old. I've lived in Zambia my whole life. Ive stayed with my mother most of my life. My father passed away when i was nine years old in the year 2016.
     I completed my primary education at a school called Libala Adventist School. I completed junior secondary education at a school called Terranova Boarding and Day school. I finally completed my senior secondary education from a school known as Kings Palace Academy.
    My highest education level is twelvth grade, am currently awaiting my results that are likely to be out by february.
    I would like to study computer engineering, because ive always dreamed of being a computer engineer since i was in eighth grade. Also, the world is evolving into an age of computers and eventually most jobs will be replaced by computers. Therefore, i would like to study computer engineering in order to make the world a better place and to satisfy the needs of people.
   My mother is an accounts assistant, my father passed away in the year 2016. My mothers highest education level is a diploma in Foundation In Accounting (FIA). She has been supporting me for my education since primary school. She will still continue to support me in my higher education abroad.
   The school i completed my secondary education from was Kings Palace Academy. It is located in central province. School fees there were k9700 per term for senior secondary.
04/12/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 5285124: Yes we are. Sorry for the delay
04/12/23, 3:52 pm - +260 97 8806769: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 4:06 pm - +260 97 8806769: In a quest to uphold Mwakas curiosity of inventions which began at a tender age, I encouraged him to follow his dream. His passion to invent different things led him to participate in a Jets fair in lower secondary which saw him attain third place for inventing a wind turbine.
His quest to attain a scholarship and the determination he has exerted towards this has reminded me of the time shortly after the father's death when I sat him down before he went to boarding school. My words were" you will make it." You will even do better than your friends who have both parents. Follow your father's legacy and aim to even surpass him. Make him proud.
Am seeing that relentless spirit to achieve. To succeed against all odds.
Thankyou for this privilege. I know that once results are out and my son is accepted by your institution he will make a difference. Not an ordinary one but an extraordinary one.
04/12/23, 7:16 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
04/12/23, 8:14 pm - +260 97 8806769: Thankyou for your time and effort. God Bless You too
04/12/23, 8:17 pm - +260 97 5285124: Alright thankyou. God bless you too
