30/11/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Chleolyn, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
30/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I'm currently studying my lower 6 at Chinhoyi High School which is located in Mashonaland Province of Zimbabwe.  I'm from a middle class family and both my parents are  civil servants.My mother is a police officer and my Father is an educational facilitator. Due to the deteriorating economy of my country, my parents' income is not enough to provide for us all . I have my elder sister who's  studying  her Bachelor's degree with Midlands State University and she's in her Second year. I also have a little brother who will be enrolled for form one in 2024.Due to my parents' income, sending us all to school has been a challenge and as a result , it has been my major reason for looking out for a schoolarship. If given the opportunity, l would like to study Medicine. Adapting to change has been my strength lately as well as   striving so hard in my academics to produce good results. Fear of failure has been my major weakness in my life.
Thank you 🙏
30/11/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer, Chleolyn.
30/11/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder: So Chleolyn, could you kindly tell me how much *Chinhoyi High	Mash West* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
30/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Yes it will reduce the financial burden
30/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 73 259 8781: It has been my parents ever since .. as l said earlier, their income is not enough  so they engage in small scale farming every year and they get some additional finance from there . My mother as for the moment she took her leave days at work so that she can help my Father at the farm since we are already in the farming season.
30/11/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: And what is the fees Chleolyn?
30/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 73 259 8781: $200 per term .. inclusively with transport money it ranges around $280
30/11/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
30/11/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
30/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I am very much interested in science subjects and literally I'm so good at them . This got me thinking . .. Why can't l do something and make the world a better place? I would like to save lives as many people are dying everyday. This has been my motivation and my love for science subjects can be my greatest strength in learning medicine
30/11/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Honestly no one .and that's why I wish to be the first one
30/11/23, 4:11 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

God Bless You!
30/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Thanks to you... Have a good time as well
01/12/23, 8:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 838 7489: Good morning to you all. My apologies for my daughter's absent online, she is currently at school collecting her report book and are closing today. She will join us soon . Thank you.
01/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Noted, can I know, when she will be available?
01/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 838 7489: At around 1300hrs
01/12/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Noted, I am scheduling Chleolyn at 1:00 PM CAT.
01/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 838 7489: Thank you sir
01/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 73 259 8781: Hello sir my apologies.  1:00 PM will be okay .I am now back from school
01/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Education can be truly a weapon to change the world .This is true since education can create opportunities for individuals to explore their dreams and aspirations resulting in the development of societies and the economy at large. Taking for instance, if the world lacks skilled  doctors and nurses, a lot of people were going to die each and everyday which means that  society development is undermined .Also it is through  education that people gain skills , knowledge and values which helps them to make effective decisions, thus development of societies and communities. However , to give only value to education as as a weapon to changing the world will be unjust since there are other factors which can contribute to the development of the world .  Agriculture can be essential in contributing  positively to changing the world .  How can one learn on a hungry stomach ?? This is completely impossible and that's why agriculture is also  crucial to changing the world positively .We get various goods from agriculture be it Milk , grain ,meat ... However from my understanding access to resources such as food is also essential for improving people's lives and creating a better world .
01/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: It is apreciatable Chleolyn that you took the time and share your understanding of the quote, you truly have understood the motive why I start the day with these quotes.
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let us continue the session.
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 73 259 8781: It's alright sir
01/12/23, 1:48 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to bring to your notice that the Indian Education system is known to produce world-class doctors and engineers for the world, and as to set that standard high, studying Physics for Medicine is mandatory in India but I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
01/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I will have to research more on the courses  so that I make a decision on which course I can take
01/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I will hear from my parents as well so that we come to an undstanding together
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: So should I schedule for tomorrow?
01/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes that will be fine.
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
01/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Is it advisable that she undertakes physics   since she has good passes at O level
01/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs.Marambakuyana, even if she takes up physics as a subject, she would have to come to India to give NEET exam which is a national entrance exam for medicine aspirants, and if she is able to clear that exam which is very difficult, then only she would be able to get admission in Medicine in India, that is why I have suggested you the courses that follow the passion of your child, are less expensive, and also have a smaller duration than medicine.
02/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 73 259 8781: Good morning . How about Pharmacy ..do your that too at your institution?
02/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 73 259 8781: * Do you offer that program as well
02/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 73 259 8781: Typing error
02/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: Yes Chleolyn, we will offer you *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)* but completing A-level Physics is a requirement for this to happen, so do you think you can do that?
02/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 73 259 8781: Maybe I will have to do Physics separately because I wasn't doing physics at school
02/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 73 259 8781: Will it be okay ??
02/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: Yes that will be fine.
02/12/23, 11:08 am - Gurvinder: So should I brief you about *Bachelor of Pharmacy(B.Pharm.)*.

04/12/23, 8:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
04/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 71 838 7489: Morning to you too
04/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
04/12/23, 9:36 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
04/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 73 259 8781: It is crucial to set goals that inspire and motivate you .A wise man once said ," A man with an aim is like a ship without a rudder "meaning that without a goal, it is easy to feel directionless and lost  .With a clear goal in mind , one can work towards something meaningful and rewarding.When l was doing O level ,l encounterd a lot of challenges that at some point,l thought of quitting  but because of my goals and dream of being a doctor , l kept on going  and l also knew that at the end of a dark tunnel there was light and also to reach the peak of a mountain l had to risk a fall.My specific and measurable  goals helped me to stay focused,stay on track and l also made some   progress. I stayed committed to my goals and l will continue doing so. l started doing study groups with my classmates and this helped me a lot . It is an important to set high goals that you can break into small manageable steps .This way it is easy to accomplish them .Goals are the ones that keep us going even though things  are not easy . Setting goals too low do not provide enough motivation to actually do them .Without goals, life would be meaningless and it would be  easy to become complacent.
04/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 73 259 8781: Yes l did
04/12/23, 11:03 am - Gurvinder: Well said, Chleolyn.
04/12/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
04/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 73 259 8781: After five years of completing the course , l see myself working in a hospital continuing to develop my skills and expertise contributing to the growth , development and success of the organisation. I see myself working in a place where l can make a  difference, helping and saving patients lives and also l see myself as a graduate who has gained valuable experience and knowledge through internships and opportunities.l will be part of  medical professionals who are devoted to provide quality health care  to patients. The Edoofa Program can help me with mentorship and networking opportunities that can open doors and lead to new opportunities.The program can also support me financially thereby reducing the tuition cost , making it affordable to pursue higher education.lt can also help me build a strong starting point for success by providing the skills and knowledge to prosper in the medical field .The program will provide me with access to  quality education , support ,career guidance and the resources , l need to succeed and achieve my dreams.
04/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Chleolyn, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes
04/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Studying abroad , provides  an opportunity to experience a  different culture and learn a new language .lt also  creates an  opportunity to gain new academic and professional opportunities.It also provides the ability to gain new skills and also to learn solving problems in a different environment.Better education is also offered.l can gain new perspectives .The cost of education in my home country is too high and educational opportunities are limited as a result of lack of educational funding and also lack of access to educational resources.If l study abroad , l can interact with different communities around the world which can lead to an improved critical thinking, increased self- reflection and work opportunities.Lastly , l have a desire to explore the world
04/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Given the opportunity to study abroad through a schoolarship is a huge privilege and l would be grateful for the chance to learn and grow as a person .Inorder to improve the education system of my home country, l plan on sharing my experiences and learnings through presentations ,   creating events for educators , sharing resources with schools and also  creating a mentorship program to help connect students from my home country with mentors from my host country .Skills such as communication ,critical thinking,self independence , confidence ,adaptability that l might have developed ,can be shared through workshops.l can also share intercultural skills and knowledge such as understanding different educational systems and perspectives , that l would have gained,  through workshops also. Intercultural communication helps to promote tolerance and understanding between different cultures.To effectively communicate and promote my learnings from abroad , l would consider different communication chanels such as community events and social media.l would create social media campaigns , this way the education system of my home country is developed.Knowledge on different educational systems and practices, will   improve the quality of education in my home country .
04/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Chleolyn, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
04/12/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you agree?
04/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I  totally agree
04/12/23, 3:24 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes it is
04/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
04/12/23, 3:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

04/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Olk
04/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now Chleolyn, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
04/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 73 259 8781: No
04/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
04/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 73 259 8781: No , we are not .
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year, but as some courses are niche in nature like *B.Pharma* itself is a course which has fewer scholarship seats, which is why for you the Annual fee after the scholarship would be between *$2700-$3700*. This cost includes:
	1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
	2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
	3. Food
	4. Accommodation
04/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 73 259 8781: olk
04/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Olk , noted
04/12/23, 3:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
04/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes
04/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Chleolyn, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
