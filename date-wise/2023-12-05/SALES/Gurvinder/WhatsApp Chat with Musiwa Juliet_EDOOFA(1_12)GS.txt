04/12/23, 8:29 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs.Mhaka, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Precious, is that correct?

04/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 535 7261: Yes
04/12/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Precious, also do tell me whether you learnt about Precious’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
04/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 535 7261: Edoofa scholarship program is a program that helps students pursue their tertiary education in lndia.I heard that edoofa is a working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador Dr Chipare in giving students scholarships..lt gives opportunities to earn $50- $100 per month
04/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: I see you are well-informed Juliet.
04/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: But let me also brief you about the program.
04/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/12/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 535 7261: This is wonderfull
04/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 535 7261: Yes am looking forward to become independent at the same time being responsible....l also wish to help my parents in reducing the financial burden on higher education especially with the rates in Zimbabwe ...that is why l wish to be selected by Edoofa

04/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Juliet, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
04/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
04/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
04/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 77 535 7261: Yes I have the two significant metrics
04/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 535 7261: my parents are following this session

04/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Juliet, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
04/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 535 7261: Yes
04/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
04/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 535 7261: I am willing to
04/12/23, 2:25 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 535 7261: Ok
04/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 535 7261: Well l want to study abroad because the quality of education  is higher in other countries. There are more opportunities for career advancement after graduation if one has studied abroad.  Studying abroad can provide cultural enrichment and exposure to new ideas. Also studying abroad is the opportunity to improve language skills.For us students from Zimbabwe, this may mean learning English or another foreign language. This can be extremely valuable for future career prospects, both in Zimbabwe and internationally. Additionally, studying abroad can lead to new friendships and relationships that would not have been possible at home. These relationships can last a lifetime and provide support and encouragement throughout one's career. In short, studying abroad has many advantages that can help students from Zimbabwe reach their full potential.
04/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 535 7261: Umm actually I would love to use my learnings from abroad to improve the education system in my country. One way I could do this is by introducing new teaching methods and materials to the schools in Zimbabwe. I could also share my knowledge of international best practices in education with other teachers and administrators.I could work to develop new educational programs that are tailored to the needs of students in Zimbabwe. Finally, I could use my experience to advocate for increased funding for education in my country
04/12/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Juliet, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
04/12/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Don’t you agree?
04/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 535 7261: Yes
04/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
04/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 535 7261: It is
04/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
04/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
