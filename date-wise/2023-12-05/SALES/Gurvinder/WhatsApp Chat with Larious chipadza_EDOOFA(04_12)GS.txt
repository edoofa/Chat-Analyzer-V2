You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
04/12/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 970 0151: Ok thank you so much
