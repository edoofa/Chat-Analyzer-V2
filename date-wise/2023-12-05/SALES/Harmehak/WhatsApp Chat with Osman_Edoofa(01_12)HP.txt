I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?

Kindly excuse the delay due to an urgent board meeting.
04/12/23, 12:56 pm - +232 99 635766: Yes ma
04/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow the resources shared on Saturday, Osman?
04/12/23, 1:03 pm - +232 99 635766: Yes
04/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
04/12/23, 1:29 pm - +232 99 635766: 1. My understanding of the Edoofa program is that to help the students to further their education give them knowledge so that they can be the future leaders of tomorrow and they will also help others who are in need of education bring developments in a country and motivate others to learn 
2. the financial aspect of the program is that I didn't able to afford that kind of money like i told you the last time I didn't have support am just managing things are hard, that is all I have to say
04/12/23, 1:57 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Osman.

However did you happen to discuss with your parents?
04/12/23, 1:58 pm - +232 99 635766: Oh yeah 
I have discussed it to them
04/12/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: I understand.

Did you happen to learn about the Earn While You Learn Program?
04/12/23, 2:07 pm - +232 99 635766: Yeah
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Osman, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
04/12/23, 2:10 pm - +232 99 635766: Ok if so no problem
04/12/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
04/12/23, 2:12 pm - +232 99 635766: Yeah
04/12/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: Do you any queries as of now, Osman?
04/12/23, 2:39 pm - +232 99 635766: No
04/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: What all did you understand regarding the finances so far, Osman?
04/12/23, 2:47 pm - +232 99 635766: I can't afford it
04/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: While amount can you not afford?
04/12/23, 2:49 pm - +232 99 635766: The program amount
04/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: What did you understand regarding the finances regarding 100% scholarship, Osman?
04/12/23, 3:04 pm - +232 99 635766: let me tell you the truth   I didn't have money to pay for this scholarship that is the truth ok
I think that this scholarship is a free funding if its a free scholarship than let work on it but if it involved in money I didn't have it that is truth
04/12/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Osman.
04/12/23, 3:08 pm - +232 99 635766: Good 👍
04/12/23, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: Let me then close your application in such a case. Feel free to re-apply when you are both mentally and financially ready to come to India for your higher education.
