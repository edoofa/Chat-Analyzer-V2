02/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: So now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/12/23, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

02/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Indeed it is a great program
02/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words
02/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
02/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes that's  every child's wish
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Shumirai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
02/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay ,firstly  my name is  Shumirai Gotami aged 19.Apparently I'm  waiting  for my form 6 results. I was doing  mathematics, physics  ,chemistry  and statistics at First Class High School .My wish is to  do Structural  engineering at one of your universities.My sources of strength  are  the current situation here is Zimbabwe and l'm not someone who  easily gives up.My greatest  weakness  is that I'm  more concerned about my studies and nothing else .Always  being  updated about what is happening  around the world is one of my hobbies as I'm  someone who is eager to  learn more.   





I'm the first born  in a family  of  4. We are from Gutu but we stay in Mutare .My father is a Central Intelligence  Officer and my mother is self employed. The highest  level  of education for my father  is  tertiary  education  after attaining a degree in ICT and for my mother  is A level. One of my siblings is doing  ordinary level and the other two are still  at primary school
02/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Shumirai, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

I can see you come from a family that is great lead by your parents.
02/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: It's great that you have a thorough clarity on what you want to study as well.
02/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 796 7593: It is  also my pleasure to  be chatting  with  you  and knowing  more about Edoofa
02/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I am glad,

Are you aware that Edoofa is proudly associated with your school as well and we have students who would be coming to India and who are currently in India from you school as well?
02/12/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes
02/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: That's great
02/12/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Are you motivated to join them?
02/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I am
02/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Sharmaine
02/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Well Sharmaine now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 796 7593: It is  a great  life changing  decision
02/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Indeed  it  is because  not everyone  gets  this opportunity
02/12/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Very well put across,

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Shumirai?
02/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes I'm more than prepared
02/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: That's great 

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
02/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes they are aware and also willing to  support as they believe  that education is  the  key to success
02/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Good evening Shumirai,

Kindly excuse the delay due to a technical challenge.
02/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive and I appreciate their thoughts.
02/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
02/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 796 7593: It's okay..don't worry
02/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I am ma'am
02/12/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: That's great
02/12/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: So Shumirai, you happened to mention your interests in doing Structural engineering,

May I know what motivates you to opt for the field? <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay  ma'am  .....after completing my studies  I  would  have a high chance of  quickly  finding  a job
02/12/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: That's a great thought,

Do you have anyone working in this field?
02/12/23, 7:28 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes my uncle
02/12/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

So Shumirai, I would like to share with you that Structural Engineering and Civil Engineering are the terms which are used interchangeably.

So shall I first brief you about your desired course so that you have a better understanding?
02/12/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes ma'am  I really  need  your  help
02/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
02/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Ma'am  can you also  give me more information  about  structural engineering
02/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Because  I'm  confused  between  civil  and structural engineering
02/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: Shumirai, Civil Engineering and Structural engineering are terms that are usually used interchangeably please.
02/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay
02/12/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*
02/12/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Structural Engineering is one of the dedicated Masters field that a student can specifically pursue after completing Bachelors please.
02/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay ma'am  l now understand.Thank you
02/12/23, 7:43 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

Do you have any queries for me as of now?
02/12/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 796 7593: No ma'am
02/12/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
02/12/23, 7:44 pm - Harmehak: So would you like to pursue the same please?
02/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Same ma'am
02/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I have another question
02/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 796 7593: What are the requirements  for someone to  do civil  engineering
02/12/23, 7:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
02/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 796 7593: In terms of  subjects
02/12/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics please.
02/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay ma'am
02/12/23, 7:48 pm - Harmehak: So shall we proceed ahead, Shumirai?
02/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes
02/12/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Shumirai, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
02/12/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I see myself  as  a very successful  person who is self dependent  ,someone  who is able  to employ  and not being employed
02/12/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 796 7593: India  is well  known  for offering  the best education opportunities  comparing to  other  countries  so l believe that studying in India will  equip me for a better  job as an engineer
02/12/23, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Shumirai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
02/12/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Honestly  speaking in the case of India,l have always wanted  to  visit  India .It have been  a dream to study there ever since  I  was  a  kid . Outside the country there is great  exposure  that a person gets to learn  a lot comparing  when  studying in Zimbabwe
03/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Good afternoon Shumirai!
03/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful,I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
03/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 796 7593: How are you  ma'am
03/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Its  fees comparing with Zimbabwe  or other countries  and it is where most of the well known  engineers  originate
03/12/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
03/12/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

03/12/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 796 7593: There's really alot of information  that  l was unaware of
03/12/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Thank you  so much ma'am
04/12/23, 8:19 am - Harmehak: Good morning Shumirai, how are you doing today?

Are we good to proceed ahead?
04/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 796 7593: I'm fine  ma'am and you
04/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 796 7593: Yes
04/12/23, 9:25 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please
04/12/23, 9:26 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
04/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 796 7593: No
04/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Alright please.
04/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
04/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
04/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
04/12/23, 10:58 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 796 7593: Really
04/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 796 7593: That is  nice
04/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Yes please
04/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
04/12/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Kindly ensure active participation, Shumirai.
04/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay sorry  ..l was send to town  to do some work
04/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 796 7593: That is  good  ma'am
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Harmehak: I understand please,
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
04/12/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

04/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words of appreciation and we look forward to you doing wonders as well!
04/12/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
04/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay
04/12/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

04/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, I understand
04/12/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
04/12/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: @263777967593
04/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes ma'am
04/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I'm  very sorry
04/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 796 7593: For the inconvenience
04/12/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Shumirai.
04/12/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Shumirai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
04/12/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay  ma'am
04/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay
04/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 796 7593: 1500-2550
04/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/12/23, 5:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay
04/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: You see, Shumirai, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
04/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Yes I  do
04/12/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
04/12/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
04/12/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 796 7593: That is  nice
04/12/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
04/12/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
04/12/23, 5:16 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
04/12/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 796 7593: I did
04/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
04/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
04/12/23, 5:19 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

04/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay
04/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
04/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
04/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Wow that is  inspiring
04/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 796 7593: Okay ma'am
04/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
04/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
04/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
