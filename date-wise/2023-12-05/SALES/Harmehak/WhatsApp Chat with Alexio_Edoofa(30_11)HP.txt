02/12/23, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: While I understand the same,

Did you discuss with them earlier as well, Alexio?
02/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 284 0293: Yes and they said they want to know fees need per term .Mayb this may decides me to study abroad or
02/12/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: I understand
02/12/23, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Alexio, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 284 0293: Yes I can agree with
02/12/23, 7:20 pm - Harmehak: So Considering that the costs would be less than those in Zimbabwe,

Are they willing to support you financially?
02/12/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could continue however, I would be scheduling your session for *Monday at 9 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
04/12/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?

04/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 284 0293: Yes I'm doing well

Yes we can start
04/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: Could you please answer the same?
04/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 284 0293: Yes they're going to as you said that to those who are in Zimbabwe costs will be less but why Zimbabwe?
04/12/23, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate or rephrase, Alexio?
04/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 284 0293: Okky I'm trying to say .. Yes they're willing to support me

04/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 284 0293: My father is the one who is going to support me  but he is afraid of the charges
04/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Which charges are you referring to please?

04/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 284 0293: They want me to come to India
04/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I understand,

So what has their financial planning been so far for your higher education?
04/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 284 0293: Olky Yesterday I did negotiate with them and they said you will if you're done with your interview and we will start to organise after your question
04/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 284 0293: **s
04/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: I can understand,

So Alexio, given the finances are less than those in Zimbabwe,

Are they willing to support you financially?
04/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 284 0293: Yes
04/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Alright please
04/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
04/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 284 0293: What about O 'level
04/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: They too are required please
04/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 284 0293: Yes just because I have O level results only
04/12/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: When did you appear for your O level exams please?
04/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 284 0293: Last year
04/12/23, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright and did you proceed with your A level this year?
04/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 284 0293: No I was applying for Polytechnic
04/12/23, 2:38 pm - Harmehak: When did you apply please?
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 284 0293: This year
04/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: For which intake, Alexio?
04/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 284 0293: Next year August intake
04/12/23, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response earlier, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
