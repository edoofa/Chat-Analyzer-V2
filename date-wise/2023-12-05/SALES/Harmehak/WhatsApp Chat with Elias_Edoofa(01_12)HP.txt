You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/12/23, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

Currently  I worked under ministry of health and child care iam a nurse my husband  is a Prisoner officer we are very happy as parents for our child to go further with education especially  at your University  in your country  it's our pleasure  thank you very much  we are wait to hearing from you
02/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Well received Mrs Cathrine, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
02/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 390 6328: You are welcome
02/12/23, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Now, I would like to know Elias better as a student,

How he is at school, his interest and hobbies along with anything that you would like to share about him?
02/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 390 6328: Sorry  for delay  Anyway  My son is better  at school naturally  he is intelligence  
He is interested in sports especially  football  and watching  movies (Indians)
02/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know more about him, Mrs Cathrine.
02/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
02/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 390 6328: Yes
02/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 390 6328: True
