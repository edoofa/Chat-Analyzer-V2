12/10/23, 4:43 pm - +91 82875 72068: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Kudzi.
12/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 145 2450: I'm done
12/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 78 145 2450: excellent work well-done India, this is motivational
12/10/23, 5:10 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am delighted to hear that, Kudzi! After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
12/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 145 2450: No one does not want his or her qualification to be recognized international to me it something that is so helpful and normally due to quality education provided in India your qualification will be not of cheap labor hence that is also good part of India, a lot helped me I've seen young people being recognized world wide and also woman who are billionaires this show that there is gender equality, so indeed I was motivated to an extend that I'll fight harder until I enables my country's economy to grow we have a lot to copy from you.
12/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Due to the rate of India's economy growth  as a student I'll learn a lot because normally when a country is growing there is always raising of new and  effective ideas that will also assist us as students hence academically will be very equiped and ready to stand.
12/10/23, 5:40 pm - +91 82875 72068: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
12/10/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Approximately I just discovered that for the diploma programs the fee is around 9000USD to 11000 from various universities I checked on
12/10/23, 5:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
12/10/23, 5:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 5:50 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
12/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 145 2450: This message was deleted
12/10/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 145 2450: my parents were saying the expenses needed are beyond their bank account so they were saying if you can find me any cheaper schools they would really appreciate that
12/10/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Or assisted  with a ¾ to full scholarship
12/10/23, 6:14 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well Kudzi, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
12/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 145 2450: For the fees to be honest with you they very good and affordable  but due to the unstable economy in some extend the whole fee for the university there, can be someone's with a proffesional job annual average salary, that is why it is why it is a bit difficult for my parents
12/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 145 2450: No, I don't have any clue
12/10/23, 6:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Kudzi. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/10/23, 6:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
12/10/23, 6:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
12/10/23, 6:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
12/10/23, 6:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
12/10/23, 6:17 pm - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
12/10/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Very interesting
12/10/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Unfortunately  my phone is running out of power as I said earlier that at the moment we do not have electricity
12/10/23, 6:30 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 145 2450: This is helpful because by the time you finish your program you will be more than ready through this EWYL and it also installs braveness to the students and also reduces fear of the unknown the market hence making the edoofiance diffent from others.
13/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 145 2450: Morning may we begin today's session by 10:00 am by then I'll be ready
13/10/23, 10:08 am - +91 82875 72068: Good Morning,

*"The best way to predict the future is to create it." - Peter Drucker*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
13/10/23, 10:10 am - +263 78 145 2450: Yes I'm ready, good morning
13/10/23, 10:33 am - +91 82875 72068: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Kudzi!
13/10/23, 10:33 am - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
13/10/23, 10:33 am - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
13/10/23, 10:34 am - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
13/10/23, 10:34 am - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

13/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 145 2450: Yes thank you
13/10/23, 10:35 am - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 10:35 am - +91 82875 72068: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
13/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 145 2450: Yes, it's very helpful
13/10/23, 10:57 am - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
13/10/23, 10:57 am - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
13/10/23, 10:57 am - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
13/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 145 2450: All the points are much appreciated, but among all those the forth point was best for me, when ever you have someone who is always there for you in every aspect of your life, you feel to be loved, to be special, it also motivates me as a student by that it pushes me to even work harder towards my education inorder to avoid disappointments to the people who have full trust in me.
13/10/23, 11:51 am - +91 82875 72068: I am elated to hear that, Kudzi! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
13/10/23, 11:51 am - +91 82875 72068: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/10/23, 11:56 am - +263 78 145 2450: They are very happy and proud of their son, to them it's a great achievement
13/10/23, 12:00 pm - +91 82875 72068: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
13/10/23, 12:00 pm - +91 82875 72068: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
13/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Where I live at the moment we do not have electricity, it only comes for short period then switched off so since morning till now we do not have electricity and my phone is running out of power and now it's on 15%
13/10/23, 1:19 pm - +91 82875 72068: I can understand your concern, Kudzi. However, I would request you to be active for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session.
13/10/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Where I live at the moment we do not have electricity, it only comes for a short period of time then switched off so since morning till now we do not have electricity and my phone is running out of power and now it's on 15%.
13/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Thank you
13/10/23, 1:21 pm - +91 82875 72068: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 145 2450: I think stage 5
13/10/23, 1:25 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Yes  you can do so
13/10/23, 1:35 pm - +91 82875 72068: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$750) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
13/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Yes understood
13/10/23, 1:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
13/10/23, 1:46 pm - +91 82875 72068: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

13/10/23, 1:47 pm - +91 82875 72068: Is there anything else you would like to inquire about or any other questions I can help you with?
13/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 145 2450: Okay if there is any I'll do so.
13/10/23, 1:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: It was my pleasure assisting you, Kudzi!
13/10/23, 1:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family
13/10/23, 1:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*

14/10/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 145 2450: My session with Mr Shashwat was so amazing. One thing I admire the most from Mr Shashwat, he is humbled, he is a man who understand and he was also patient  enough if I had any problem. Indeed this session was wonderful I had no complain against him cause he had to guide me in everything and he even assisted me choosing the right path in terms of the field to study on that may suit my career and he also had to do some research for me which is something appreciated the most.
To add on, Mr Shashwat had to explain everything about the Edoofa  program and I understood everything and he also shared some video clips of some students who made it through this Edoofa program and it was so motivational, in short the session was so great and courageous much appreciation to Mr Shashwat.
14/10/23, 1:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: That's really good to know ,he indeed is one of the best counselor who has personally transferred life's of 1000's of families .

14/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 618 4236: Sure, I contacted her. She said that Edoofa is the best and our children will be in safe hands. It has brought much relief to my heart.    As a parent when you get information from a parent who has his s or her child being taken care of and being natured in good behavior and being monitored during their academy. As a parent you will be comfortable and have a peaceful mindset
14/10/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 618 4236: The way Mr Shashwat explained to my child left me no questions. He explained everything that I ended up wishing if I was still young. I would like to start again with education. He motivated me and also my child. Also the way of Earn While You Learn , I appreciated it because it gives much knowledge to our children. It's like a job on the training that will equip them. On the EWYL, I would like to ask if they shall be assisted to get jobs where they will be acquiring much knowledge by Edoofa or it's the university or the college to they will be

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
16/10/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 145 2450: 1. Diploma in Mechanical engineering.
2. India
3. For international students it is around $6000-$8000
4. It be reduced to $2000 -$3000 per annum.
5. Due to COVID 19 it was reduced to $350.
6. If found eligible for the program, you have to pay the first part of enrollment fee of $200 within the period of 7 days.

17/10/23, 10:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
17/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 145 2450: Morning, I'm fine and you.
17/10/23, 11:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
17/10/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 618 4236: I am ready
17/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 145 2450: Yes they are.
17/10/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please answer using voice notes ?

17/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 618 4236: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
17/10/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
17/10/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
17/10/23, 12:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 12:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 23th or 24th October 2023 for $200 and the 23th or 24th of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 23th or 24th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
