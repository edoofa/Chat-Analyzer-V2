Ok concerning the issue of high school charges,, i was a donatee under Tanaka Educational Fund from form 1 to 4 because i had no one to pay my fees.I was learning at Mukomberanwa High School by then.The fees was $40 per term. My brother was jobless and my mom too,,my sister was married so the journey was tough but i really thank God for the donors. In 2022 my mother got employed as a teacher and had to go to a relative to stay with whilst doing my schooling..the fees there was $90 per term and she is the only one who paid it. My brother got a job as a machine operator at a certain mine this year and he also supported mom with my registration fee to write my A-level examinations.
