We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

23/11/23, 12:14 pm - +260 96 2284130: *employed...

23/11/23, 12:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Sijamali. As your *Career Counselor* it is my duty to guide you towards a path that caters to your aspirations. I have analyzed your endeavors and career inclinations. According to my expertise, this program will align perfectly with your magnificent vision:

*B.Tech Civil*
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
23/11/23, 12:48 pm - +260 779684777: I too would be honored to be under your guidance and learn all I can about my career choices and I’m looking forward to the experience
23/11/23, 12:50 pm - +260 779684777: Yes I would
23/11/23, 12:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Tech Civil
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
23/11/23, 12:56 pm - +260 96 2284130: Thank you for your generosity with information
23/11/23, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with Sijamali's career aspirations?
23/11/23, 1:01 pm - +260 96 2284130: Yes very much. 
It would  be a dream come true  for and he will  work hard  to realise and testify in future
23/11/23, 1:01 pm - +260 96 2284130: ^ him..
23/11/23, 1:06 pm - +260 779684777: Sorry but I’m currently using my older brother’s phone and he’s leaving can we reschedule the meeting till he gets back if that’s ok with you?
23/11/23, 1:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Sijamali. I would like to inform you that Mrs. Gladys can continue with the session in your absence, please.
23/11/23, 1:24 pm - +260 96 2284130: Thank you.  Am available
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Mrs. Gladys!
23/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, now that you have a clear picture of Sijamali's career and an understanding of the program, do you know which countries Edoofa suggests for higher education?
23/11/23, 2:21 pm - +260 96 2284130: Unless I have gotten the question wrong, I understand you are partnered with Penmal Connect Ltd and Trident College, but the host universities are in India  while  leaners are from zambia,   South Africa and many other  African countries.
23/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! *Edoofa* strongly recommends *India* for higher education! May I know what is your knowledge of India and the Indian Education System?
23/11/23, 3:41 pm - +260 96 2284130: I know  that India highly places its education to all its  citizens. 
According to my little knowledge,  the Indian education system is  a state run public education system, at  central, state and local  levels. 
I know  and appreciate the Indian education system because it places its emphasis on the education for all and its free and compulsory to all children under the age of 14.
Being  run by the state it comes a long with all the quality to amass all the skills the country needs for development. 
This counselling has opened  doors for me and my family to learn more about India and its education system and its culture as a whole.
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Gladys. India's education system and its profound cultural diversity are sources of immense pride and admiration on a global scale. The education system's emphasis on holistic learning and the pursuit of knowledge has produced accomplished individuals who excel in various fields across the world. India's remarkable cultural diversity, with its multitude of languages, traditions, art forms, and cuisines, fosters a rich tapestry of human experiences that inspire unity in diversity. Together, these aspects represent India's invaluable contributions to global education and cultural enrichment, fostering understanding and harmony among people of all backgrounds!
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that India's civil engineering sector has made remarkable strides on the global stage. It showcases a perfect blend of ancient architectural marvels and cutting-edge infrastructure projects. With an ever-growing demand for innovative infrastructure, Indian civil engineers have consistently demonstrated their skills, creativity, and dedication. From constructing iconic bridges to sustainable buildings, India's civil engineers have left an indelible mark on the world, contributing significantly to global infrastructure development and setting high standards for quality and innovation!

23/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Mrs. Gladys.
23/11/23, 4:42 pm - +260 96 2284130: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:46 pm - +260 96 2284130: I have read through your profound introduction to Indias admirable education system. 
It's so inspiring.  How I pray my son gets into this world that you have just explained.  His choice of the career path is what has made India to be the India the world admires in terms of infrastructure. 
I feel  like am reading his acceptance letter 😁
23/11/23, 4:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Sijamali to India for his higher studies!
23/11/23, 5:06 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh yes very much interested....and he's very excited to after  hearing that you  offer his dream  course and he hsd always wanted to study abroad
23/11/23, 5:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
23/11/23, 6:04 pm - +260 96 2284130: Thank you. 
Yes am familiar with the quality education and the cost attached to it as my son while studying for his civil engineering degree in China did not have  full scholarship.
23/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please feel to share, Mrs. Gladys.
23/11/23, 6:05 pm - +260 96 2284130: See above.   I have  responded  sir
23/11/23, 6:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Gladys! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
23/11/23, 7:54 pm - +260 96 2284130: Yes sir its affordable. More especially if he got the latter one with exclusive scholarship
23/11/23, 7:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Gladys. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
23/11/23, 7:57 pm - +260 96 2284130: Wow!! That sounds fantastic sir. Please carry on an guide us.
23/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Gladys. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
23/11/23, 8:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
23/11/23, 8:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - +260 96 2284130: Yes ofcourse the benefits are overwhelmingly great. It would be a life changer in many areas of his life and to us as parents sponsoring him financially
23/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
23/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
23/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
23/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

23/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Sijamali can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on his parents?
23/11/23, 8:50 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh yes I can see this huge benefit.  It would  really reduce a lot of financial pressure off our shoulder.  It'd a fantastic arrangement and the benefits cannot not be over emphasised.
23/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
23/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
23/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - +260 96 2284130: None of the four distinguishing facts cannot be appreciated according to me and my family.  They compliment each other so well.  I would go and vite  for all the four , they have individual distinguished rewards to the learner and sponsors.
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Mrs. Gladys! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - +260 96 2284130: *vote
23/11/23, 9:10 pm - +260 96 2284130: Number 2. Its the desire of every learner and parent to see that their  child easily gets a job soon after their  training. Employerbility to  me tops
23/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Gladys. The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
23/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Sijamali studying abroad?
23/11/23, 9:16 pm - +260 96 2284130: The feeling ecstatic...he has always talked about doing his studies abroad and I like it because there's that level of responsibility, discipline and maturity attained when a child learns abroad. We cannot over emphasise the exposure that comes with it?
23/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
23/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
23/11/23, 9:25 pm - +260 96 2284130: The report from the former school would  also help as it would help to describe the character of the child .
The academic report also  is important.
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Gladys. You will be glad to know that we here at Edoofa have a dedicated team that will help Sijamali with his *Statement of Purpose* as well as the *Letter of Recommendation*!
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
23/11/23, 9:27 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh ok. Great
23/11/23, 9:28 pm - +260 96 2284130: How long after  this counselling do we know if our child has made it ?
23/11/23, 9:32 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh ok. Thank you for the clarity
23/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their Grade 12 result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
23/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
23/11/23, 9:41 pm - +260 96 2284130: Ok great. 
You have  mentioned that there's a standard pass mark  or necessary requirement by Edoofa.
Would you share the  pass requirement to be legible?
23/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Gladys. The basic requirement for eligibility is that students are encouraged to achieve a minimum passing score in all subjects.
23/11/23, 9:46 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh ok. Great.
23/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
23/11/23, 9:50 pm - +260 96 2284130: I was  just about to ask to be excused. Can we continue tomorrow.  You can advise the time. 
You will  find the response before we continue tomorrow.
23/11/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Gladys. However, I would request you to be active for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session. May I know whether that is convenient for you, please?
23/11/23, 9:58 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh ok..we can carry  on
23/11/23, 10:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
23/11/23, 10:01 pm - +260 96 2284130: There are different flexible packages in terms of payments, instalment payments, earn while learning..fantastic
23/11/23, 10:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
23/11/23, 10:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:07 pm - +260 96 2284130: We are at and concluding phase 1. Hopefully that's the answer. 😁
23/11/23, 10:08 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh yes.. I didn't realise I had  to itemise them as you have done.
23/11/23, 10:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
23/11/23, 10:11 pm - +260 96 2284130: Oh yes🤦🏽‍♂️ you are right.
23/11/23, 10:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
23/11/23, 10:16 pm - +260 96 2284130: The process is very clear thank you.
23/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It would be my pleasure to introduce you to Ms. Betty in Zambia, who can provide you with a more detailed understanding of the program. Please feel free to connect with her and don't hesitate to ask any questions or seek clarification. Your thorough understanding of the program is important to us, and we're here to assist you every step of the way.
23/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ms. Betty.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 10:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Is there anything else you would like to inquire about or any other questions I can help you with?
23/11/23, 10:19 pm - +260 96 2284130: So far so good. You are very elaborate sir. 
If I will have any questions I will send them through.  But none as at now.
Just 🤞🏼hoping for the best as we proceed.
23/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Mrs. Gladys!
23/11/23, 10:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family
