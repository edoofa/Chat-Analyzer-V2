02/11/23, 11:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question? I would love to gain your perspective!
02/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 628 2439: OK thank you I don't think I can manage all of it because I don't earn a lot in my sellings that's why she applied to Edoofa
02/11/23, 11:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand your concern, Mrs. Ottilia. As I have mentioned before, *Edoofa* offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. However, there are some miscellaneous fees after the scholarship. May I kindly inquire if you would consider extending support to assist Ruvimbo with those additional expenses?
02/11/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 628 2439: I think I can assist with that if not much thank you

02/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 628 2439: These are her previous Olevel qualification and she is going to complete her Alevel this month thank you
02/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 628 2439: What motivates me is she is always on her books and she works hard on them
02/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Ottilia. Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills!
02/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Mrs. Ottilia. Can you please share her previous term results as well?

02/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Mrs. Ottilia. However, since the coursework is extremely intrinsic for the evaluation, can you please share her previous term results in a textual format?
02/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 628 2439: Thank you she wrote 2 subjects instead  of 4 then she gets  points plus they  gets the results from revisions not exams
02/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 628 2439: She got 7 points
02/11/23, 4:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please mention the subjects as well, Mrs. Otillia?
02/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 628 2439: OK sir I will come back to you thank you
02/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Otillia. I will be waiting for your response.
02/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 628 2439: Family and religious studies. History. Heritage  and communication skills
02/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 628 2439: Those are the subjects sir thank you
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! That information will suffice for now but I believe you will be sending the documents as well.
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!

03/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Ruvimbo.
03/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 731 2002: About the indian education system its quite extensive and varied

It really is an interesting country which is rich in its economy and culture as well
03/11/23, 5:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
03/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 731 2002: As a result of studying in India am seeing myself achieving all my goals as India is a nation great wonders and is progressive in its education system

03/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
03/11/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Ughm i do not have any information on that 
But what i know is it is expensive for such higher education
03/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Ruvimbo! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
03/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
03/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
03/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 731 2002: I would like this programme of earning while you learn sir
03/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Sorry sir i would really like to understand on the reduced fees
03/11/23, 6:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate your query, Ruvimbo?
03/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Sorry sir but i really need to know on the fees if it is dollars 
And if that $2000 is paid for the whole year
03/11/23, 6:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ruvimbo. If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc! This cost is paid in two equal installments. Each installment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters in a year
03/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Does this mean that i would be the one paying $1200 to $1800
03/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Ruvimbo. However, You will be glad to know that we offer a distinctive program that allows students to engage in internships and self-finance a significant part of their fees while completing their coursework. I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
03/11/23, 10:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 11:15 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Okay sir thank you
03/11/23, 11:16 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Okay sir thank you very much 
Have a blessed night
04/11/23, 10:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"You have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world." - Harriet Tubman*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 731 2002: Good morning
04/11/23, 10:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ruvimbo!
04/11/23, 10:11 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you find this affordable, please?
04/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 731 2002: Yes sir
04/11/23, 10:34 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ruvimbo. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth? <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 731 2002: Yes thank you sir
04/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ruvimbo. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/11/23, 10:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/11/23, 10:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
04/11/23, 10:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
04/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 731 2002: This programme will surely benefit me sir
04/11/23, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
04/11/23, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
04/11/23, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
04/11/23, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

04/11/23, 10:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
04/11/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 731 2002: Yes sir 
This is very helpful in reducing the financial pressure
04/11/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 731 2002: It is indeed a good programme
04/11/23, 11:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
04/11/23, 11:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/11/23, 11:01 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
04/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 731 2002: Ughm the fourth point is making the Edoofa programme one of the best as it stays with the students throughout their journey to success making it unique
04/11/23, 11:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Ruvimbo! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
04/11/23, 11:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/11/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 731 2002: Your work is quiet outstanding sir
04/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 731 2002: Ughm my family feels delighted  as i will be pursuing mu education to a higher level but at the same time they are going to be sad as i will be far from them
04/11/23, 11:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand their concern, Ruvimbo. I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
04/11/23, 11:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
04/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 731 2002: Thank you sir
I really appreciate you having these sessions with me
04/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 731 2002: Ughm i think that is much needed in applying abroad
04/11/23, 11:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to assist you through the process, Ruvimbo!
04/11/23, 11:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
04/11/23, 11:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
04/11/23, 11:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 11:25 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
04/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 731 2002: Thank you sir
04/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 731 2002: Am sorry but i need to understand how much would i pay as an enrollment fee
04/11/23, 11:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
04/11/23, 11:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
04/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 731 2002: I can say the Edoofa programme is one of the best
04/11/23, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Ruvimbo!
04/11/23, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
04/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 731 2002: In my understanding the Edoofa programme helps a student with the finances with the 50to100percent with the help of the earn while you learn programme helping in reducing the tuition fees and accomodation inorder to reduce the pressure on the parents
It has also reduced the enrollment fee as for the students to afford these high education universities
04/11/23, 11:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum.
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
04/11/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 731 2002: Thank you sir i now understand better
04/11/23, 11:52 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 731 2002: We have discussed about personalized counselling session which is the number 1 stage
04/11/23, 11:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
04/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Yes  
Thank you sir
04/11/23, 12:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

06/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 628 2439: Thank you good morning sir
06/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 731 2002: Good morning sir thank you
06/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 731 2002: Yes sir we may proceed
06/11/23, 11:52 am - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?

Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
06/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Yes sir she helped me understand how Edoofa helped her
And she also enlightened me of how interesting the programme can be
06/11/23, 1:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

07/11/23, 6:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

3.$6000...$8000

6.7 days
7.Yes sir

07/11/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Yes sir
08/11/23, 11:37 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
08/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 731 2002: A very good Afternoon to you sir
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge using voice notes ?
08/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Okay sir
08/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 628 2439: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th November 2023 for $200 and the 13th or 14th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 628 2439: Good evening sorry for late reply. Indeed things are tough here in Zim I think I Wil opt for number 1 thank you sir

15/11/23, 3:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you and your family go through your acceptance letter ?
15/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 731 2002: Yes sir
15/11/23, 4:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you have any questions for me ?
16/11/23, 12:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
Shall we start today's session?
16/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 628 2439: A very good afternoon to you sir sorry Ruvimbo still at exam I think she will be home at 1.30pm thank you
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Wishing her all the best
16/11/23, 1:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ?
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 628 2439: Thank you sir
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
