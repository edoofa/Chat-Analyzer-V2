It also makes it easier for you to study abroad
17/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 720 1861: I had exams so l couldn't research much
17/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please
17/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Well received, Ryan, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

17/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 720 1861: Okay thank you
17/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 720 1861: So which programs do you offer
17/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 720 1861: How do we start the process of applying for a scholarship?
17/11/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: I would discuss the entire process in detail with you.
17/11/23, 11:47 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Ryan, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Okay so lm Ryan Tadiwanashe Mude  
I currently learn at St Ignatius College and lm currently in form 5.l do Mathematics,Physics and  Geography  .lm in the athletics ,tabletennis ,
rugby and chess first teams .lm also in Christian life community club where we donate food and  essential commodities to orphanages and the less privileged in our community. I would say that my hobbies are exercising,reading books with any interesting facts about life ,having quality time with my family and also playing sports.One of my strengths is that l don't give up because in form 1  l was not accepted at St Ignatius College but l kept pushing and they accepted me 2 years later .ln form 5 also they gave me maths business studies and Geography but l kept pushing again until they gave me physics 4 months ago ,so when l want something l don't give up and my other strength is that lm social ,l can fit in any community and environment .One of my weaknesses is that l don't know the difference between perseverance and knowing when to give up .My parents have diplomas from college education that's why they are determined to send us to university .My mom is a teacher and my dad is self employed now but 
He was a firefighter before  he was retrenched when the Zimbabwean economy took a dark turn.
Irene is an architect, my other sister is a Banking analyst
My third sister is studying quantity surveying.

I'd like to study civil engineering or aviation 

 Are there any other options you think I should be looking at?
17/11/23, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Ryan, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

It's great to see the examples of your dedication.

I can see that your siblings are well into education as well, and you must look upto them, isn't it?
17/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Yes very much so and since l am the only boy and the last born they all have big expectations of me. I  am also trying to achieve great things and make them proud.
I'd love to not letting anyone down who has invested their all on me
17/11/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit, Ryan!

Are you aware Edoofa is proudly associated with your school?

We have students who would be coming to India from St Ignatius next year as well as in 2025 from your batch itself?
17/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 720 1861: That's amazing news.

It's refreshing to hear you've got alumni from my school!!!!

How can I work towards being part of the 2025 batch
17/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I'd like to also express my gratitude for your time and responses
17/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Ryan!

We are currently in the discussion for same itself.
17/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
17/11/23, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: Well Ryan now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
17/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Yes l believe it's a life changing decision given the state of our country in how unemployment rates are so high .Learning abroad would allow you to gain internationally recognized knowledge that l can bring back to my country and l do my part to help in growing the economy and developing my country
17/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 720 1861: It's also life changing because l get to understand and know other cultures and societies
17/11/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: That's well put across, Ryan.
17/11/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: You see, Ryan, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
17/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 720 1861: This is interesting indeed .l will make sure l will seize every opportunity presented to me without having second thoughts
17/11/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same, Ryan!
17/11/23, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Ryan you mentioned your wish to study Engineering!

So what motivates you to pursue Civil Engineering please?
17/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I think what motivates me is that l want to help rebuild structures that will help my country .Civil engineers are responsible for the development of every visible construction in the world
The state of my country needs men and women who will work tirelessly to improve the construction sector in the country
17/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Ryan!

I can see your inclination towards your desired field.

So did you happen to research about the requirements for Civil Engineering, Ryan?
17/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Yes l saw that you need mostly passes in  Mathematics and Physics
17/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Are there other requirements?
17/11/23, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, however Chemistry too is required please.
17/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I did write chemistry in O level
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

However it's required in A level,

You can request to change from Geography to Chemistry, please?
17/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I'm writing my Alevel exams next year that might be difficult but l will see if l can add it as a fourth subject
17/11/23, 2:19 pm - Harmehak: I can understand Ryan.
17/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 720 1861: So you can't totally be accepted to do civil engineering by Edoofa  without chemistry ?
Because when l researched some sources were actually say Geography is also needed to know about the structure of land and how it operates since civil engineering is about building
17/11/23, 2:36 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Maths and Chemistry for most Engineering courses* in their A level mandatorily.
17/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Okay so how do we proceed now
17/11/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Considering your subject combination, Ryan, you can pursue Bachelors in Planning as well.

Shall I brief you about the same?
17/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Yes you can
17/11/23, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: *B. Plan or Bachelor of Planning* is four years long full-time professional degree course in planning for aspirants who wish to become planning professionals.

17/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I think so
17/11/23, 7:51 pm - Harmehak: Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
17/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I want to study abroad because studying abroad offers more opportunities than studying here in Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe the degree might also not be recognized internationally. Studying abroad also offers better teachers and facilities. I also want to study abroad because l want to understand and learn more about other cultures ,and societies 
and l can't do that here .
17/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Ryan, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
17/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Honestly l haven't researched much because l came home yesterday but l know that India has one of the best facilities when it comes to studying science courses  so l will get the one of the  best experiences on being a successful engineer.l also know that the teaching workforce is quite experienced,so l think studying in India would give me my best shot in the degree l want to pursue. I also know that it is one of the countries that has many international students so it is a friendly environment
17/11/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand and appreciate the knowledge you have!
17/11/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

17/11/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: You can inform me once you read these.
17/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Okay
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Did you finish reading?
17/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Not yet
17/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
17/11/23, 8:34 pm - Harmehak: So Ryan, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
17/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 720 1861: No  they are not familiar with the costs
17/11/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/11/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/11/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/11/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 720 1861: It just keeps on getting better and better
17/11/23, 8:37 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Ryan.
17/11/23, 8:38 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
17/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I think this program is helping a lot because not many people can afford the expenses to go to university but this program is making it easier for us
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

17/11/23, 8:52 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Ryan.
17/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I'm trying to read all  of the links you sent
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: That's alright Ryan!

You can surely go through them once we have concluded the discussion as well please.
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Ohh okay then
17/11/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
17/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I think this can help
17/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I understand it
17/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that.
17/11/23, 8:55 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Yes very much so
I have never seen support from a program
17/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Ryan now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
17/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Yes l am
17/11/23, 9:00 pm - Harmehak: Ryan, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
17/11/23, 9:00 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
17/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 720 1861: 2250
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: Ryan, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
17/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Yes l do
17/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 720 1861: It saves a lot
17/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
17/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
17/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
17/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Okay
17/11/23, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
17/11/23, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
17/11/23, 9:08 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
17/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 720 1861: I think l do
17/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
17/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
17/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
17/11/23, 9:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
17/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
17/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Okay thank you
17/11/23, 9:14 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with her and connect your parents and sister with Mrs Ruth as well, Ryan

You all would surely learn more.
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 720 1861: Okay l will surely communicate with her
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
17/11/23, 9:19 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

20/11/23, 1:03 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
