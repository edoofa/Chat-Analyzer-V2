29/11/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please let me share some information with you sir.
29/11/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

30/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 305 2518: That's great.
30/11/23, 3:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Mr. Zinyowa, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about you studying abroad?
30/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Sure , the family is  exceptionally looking forward to the opportunity, and there are so delighted .
30/11/23, 9:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 12:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Are you ready for the same?
01/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Good day.
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How is your day progressing, Mr. Zinyowa?
01/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 305 2518: So far so good
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Dean's career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his  family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
01/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Yes  ,that sounds correct to me also.
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Mr. Zinyowa,

When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
01/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Noted with thanks.
01/12/23, 1:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid.
01/12/23, 1:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
.
01/12/23, 1:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
01/12/23, 1:29 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Just need to know  ,on Phase 2. How will the student  be able to start Earn anything  whilst there still here?
What if the student fails to excel on his A level, what will happen to the credit earned ,during Phase 2.
01/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Zinyowa, Please note that upon confirming a student's eligibility and enrollment in the program, the admission and EWYL processes will commence immediately, preceding their arrival in India.
01/12/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
01/12/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Even if Edoofians fail to meet the requirements, they have a positive path ahead. If a student qualifies as a deserving student for the Edoofa scholarship we believe that he/she has the calibre to meet the grades, so in case they fail to meet them, even then the eligibility will be valid, and students can write the exams again, gain minimum points and can join the intake. With the right needs and resources students will give their best to perform well.
01/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Okay, Okay
01/12/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 305 2518: I understand
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Mr. Zinyowa
01/12/23, 2:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 305 2518: We are now at stage 2 ,waiting for stage 3.
01/12/23, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Mr. Zinyowa, 
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Okay
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa.

04/12/23, 1:39 pm - Austin: Greetings Mr. & Mrs. Zinyowa and Dean!
*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

How are you doing?
04/12/23, 1:40 pm - Austin: We do understand the network challenges and our team was unavailable yesterday. Are you available to continue the session now?
04/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Yes, we can continue
04/12/23, 1:41 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Mr Zimyowa!
04/12/23, 1:42 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
04/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 305 2518: We are doing fine .
04/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 305 2518: I think we managed  to articulate on most of the areas that were not clear. So far no questions.
04/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 305 2518: The Edoofa Scholarship program, I think it will be of greater benefit to Dean as a student and my self as a parent.
04/12/23, 1:53 pm - Austin: Good to know!
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
04/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Sure
04/12/23, 3:00 pm - Austin: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
04/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Normally, financial issues are not an easy pass ,and that's why we as a family tried to have some supporting projects, besides salaries to fund education costs.
04/12/23, 3:23 pm - Austin: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
04/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Yes, yes, I did ,comparing to Zimbabwean education Edoofa scholarship program is way cheaper and affordable.
04/12/23, 4:41 pm - Austin: Indeed,Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
04/12/23, 4:42 pm - Austin: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
04/12/23, 5:23 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Sure
04/12/23, 6:46 pm - Austin: Noted, is Dean available for the session now?
04/12/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 305 2518: Hopefully, tomorrow  he will be available.
04/12/23, 7:43 pm - Austin: This is well noted!
