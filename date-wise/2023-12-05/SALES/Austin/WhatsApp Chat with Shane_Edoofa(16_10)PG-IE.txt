But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/10/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/10/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/10/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/10/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs

TIA Organics
21/10/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
21/10/23, 12:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
21/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 753 6134: yes i think i will benefit from the Earn while you learn programe because it helps also to explore other experiences
22/10/23, 9:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!!
22/10/23, 9:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 8:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,
I hope that you are doing well today.

I am here to begin the session, Shall we begin?
23/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 77 354 4926: Greetings,we are all fine .
23/10/23, 8:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that, Shane!!
23/10/23, 8:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, 

Please note that If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
23/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 354 4926: Thank you for the information but as of now Shane is in an examination ,i think he will be online again after a few hours.
23/10/23, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Elma, However, Please note that you can have the session on Shane's behalf and he will go through the information once available, so, are you ready for that?
23/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 354 4926: Yes you can go ahead
23/10/23, 9:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, then, Ms. Elma, proceeding further, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
23/10/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 354 4926: Point 4
23/10/23, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

23/10/23, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 354 4926: I hope i and my husband as Shane's parents will try and pay for remaining fees ,if not so then we will be in a state of looking for helpers as well
23/10/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about you studying abroad? <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 354 4926: Studying abroad is such a great opportunity and experience to us as a family.
23/10/23, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Elma, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Shane's career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
23/10/23, 10:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
23/10/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 354 4926: I aggree with you
23/10/23, 11:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Shane, 

When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
23/10/23, 11:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*

23/10/23, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
23/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 354 4926: Yes you can explain
23/10/23, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
23/10/23, 11:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/10/23, 11:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

23/10/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 354 4926: Up to stage 2
23/10/23, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Ms. Elma, 
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
23/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 354 4926: Ok
23/10/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Elma, 

*Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks. <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
23/10/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
23/10/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 354 4926: Ok
23/10/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Elma, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

We also saw it financally affordable through the Earn while you learn program and the low fees structure after getting the scholarship. We also admired the learning environments and resources in Indian Universities and we also admired the good religious and cultural perspective of the program. At last we were certain that the Edoofa program is going to help me in achieving my career goals and also tansform our family
24/10/23, 12:27 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session!

24/10/23, 12:47 pm - Austin: I appreciate the willingness of your family to invest in your career,
24/10/23, 12:47 pm - Austin: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
24/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 354 4926: Good afternoon Mr Austin
24/10/23, 1:04 pm - Austin: Good Afternoon Mrs Elma
How is your day progressing?
24/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 354 4926: My day is fine sir
24/10/23, 1:12 pm - Austin: Good to hear that!
24/10/23, 1:12 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
24/10/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 354 4926: I have been following and my view about Edoofa is that so far there is nothing bad about everything you have told us.
24/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 753 6134: 1. Bachelor of Arts,  Bachelor of Legislative Law

2.India

3.$8000 per year

4.$3000 per year if found eligible and $1000 per year   through the Earn While You Learn program

5.$350, $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within the next 30 days

6.The Earn While you Learn program is a program which a student is allowed to work whilst learning so as to earn some money which can help in the payment of the remaining fees.
24/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 354 4926: I might just need to ask that,lets say one fails to meet the expected amounts of fees needed for the program to start,is there anything that can be done like offering the admission then the student will pay as he learns because trully speaking we dont earn so much money.like i said earlier on that maybe we might be forced to look for helpers ,then again my question still says if we fail to find the helpers  will you be able to assist us so that our son's dreams come true?
24/10/23, 1:25 pm - +263 78 753 6134: 7. We are clear on this one
24/10/23, 1:38 pm - Austin: I do understand the challenges Mrs Elma and let me tell you that the enrollment fee is to be paid if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship program and considering the economic challenges in Zimbabwe, you have the payment plan for the same. Have you considered it?
24/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 354 4926: Ooh ok its alright
24/10/23, 2:11 pm - Austin: Are you having other questions for me?
24/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 296 0806: So far all is Qlear sir
24/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Everything is clear so far
24/10/23, 2:29 pm - Austin: 4)The annual fee after the scholarship is $2000-$3000
