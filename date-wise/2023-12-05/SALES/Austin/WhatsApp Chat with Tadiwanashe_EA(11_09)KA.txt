25/09/23, 8:21 am - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

I am doing fine, thank you
28/09/23, 8:32 am - Kunal: May I know, how much is his per term fee in A level in USD and who has been supporting him so far for education?

So, may I know what fascinated him about pursuing a course and career in Geographical information systems?
28/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 322 9359: He has been saying he wanted a career in the Science related field but different from all other family members to show uniqueness.
28/09/23, 8:43 am - Kunal: I see he is well motivated towards this career path and looking forward to excelling in it.
So, does he have any past experiences or learnings in this field specifically?
28/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 322 9359: He just did the subjects in class like he is doing now but in agriculture he has a shallow experience as we do peasant farming at home.

So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me his previous qualification results i.e form 5 or term and O level results, please?
A picture would be better
28/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 322 9359: Right now l am at work and he is also at school.I  will instruct him to send you the picture of the results soonest.
28/09/23, 8:55 am - Kunal: That is alright
In the meantime, may I know his subjects of A level?

28/09/23, 9:09 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them. 
I would also like to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough for resources and study materials, due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about him achieving it
28/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 322 9359: Thank you also for the good time.I am confident he will make it.We will keep on encouraging him and also pray for his success.Have a good day.

28/09/23, 12:57 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on his career?

28/09/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
28/09/23, 1:27 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
28/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 322 9359: No,idea.I still have to research.
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 322 9359: It's a tough game considering our low earnings plus other commitments.
28/09/23, 1:43 pm - Kunal: I can understand
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
28/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 322 9359: Yes,l have heard it before but not in detail.
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
28/09/23, 1:50 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

28/09/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 322 9359: I have found it really beneficial plus it creates a good brand of a graduate.I never knew it.
28/09/23, 1:59 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
28/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 322 9359: Thank you.You enlightened me a lot.
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
28/09/23, 2:06 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
28/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 322 9359: I like point number one.It covers all aspects.It's great.
28/09/23, 2:16 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

28/09/23, 2:18 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Tadiwanashe with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
28/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 322 9359: We work as a couple,father and mom.
28/09/23, 2:24 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
28/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 322 9359: With the counselling details you have given me l feel it will be a blessing if my child manages to secure the scholarship.
28/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
28/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
28/09/23, 2:51 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
28/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 322 9359: An apology Kunal.May we continue tomorrow.I am running out of power.
28/09/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 322 9359: My phone was not fully charged.
28/09/23, 3:53 pm - Kunal: ALright Mr Richard
28/09/23, 5:16 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 9:39 am - Kunal: Good morning
How are you doing?
29/09/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 322 9359: Connected but invigilating Grade Seven exams.
29/09/23, 10:25 am - Kunal: Alright Mr Richard
Can you participate?
29/09/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 322 9359: Right now l can't but will inform you later.
29/09/23, 10:29 am - Kunal: Alright Mr Richard
29/09/23, 4:36 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at  *9:30 am CAT on Tuesday (03/10/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.

Stay blessed!
29/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 322 9359: It's alright.
03/10/23, 9:49 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
How are you doing?
03/10/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 129 8755: Good , Howu Kunal ?
03/10/23, 10:02 am - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
03/10/23, 10:02 am - Kunal: Have you gone through the sessio above?
03/10/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 129 8755: Yes I did  and it enlightened me a lot
03/10/23, 10:57 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
03/10/23, 10:57 am - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
03/10/23, 10:57 am - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
03/10/23, 10:58 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 11:33 am - Kunal: Are we connected?
03/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 129 8755: Alright  ..so you pay the  fee before you get the scholarship
03/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 129 8755: Yes
03/10/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: No please
Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself. <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 11:38 am - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
03/10/23, 11:39 am - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 129 8755: Okay it's fine  then
03/10/23, 12:02 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 12:35 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
03/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Stage 5
03/10/23, 3:26 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
03/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes
03/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
03/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
03/10/23, 3:27 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
03/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Yes it's clear
03/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 129 8755: So what Percentage of  the  fees is catered for by the  Scholarship
03/10/23, 3:31 pm - Kunal: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you

*Enrollment fee*

For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc all you need to pay is $350 which can either be paid in two phases as mentioned or together


Cost of education
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc!

This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program.
03/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Okay I understand
03/10/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Can you explain  the  Earn while  you  learn  more to me
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: Sure, Tadiwanashe
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: To explain it elaborately,
The *Earn While You Learn Program* was designed to ensure our students get the necessary employability skills to succeed in the 21st-century job market. Coupled with a quality, affordable higher education experience, it ensures our students become top professionals, leaders and pioneers in their fields.
03/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kunal: Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable.
The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
03/10/23, 3:38 pm - Kunal: You can refer to this and go through the whole session for better understanding
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 129 8755: Okay thank you  it's now understandable
03/10/23, 3:39 pm - Kunal: Tadiwanashe, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

04/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 322 9359: I found that the fees are high but l was relieved when l learnt that some of it can be paid in instalments plus the Earn While You Learn Program helps a lot.

04/10/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 322 9359: Right now l believe he is in class.I cannot get hold of him.
04/10/23, 12:23 pm - Kunal: Alright, I understand
As you know, form 6 students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests.
04/10/23, 12:24 pm - Kunal: All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Tadiwanashe?*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

a) The Change of Nature

d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.

3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ?
a) enfeeble
b) thriving
c) strengthen
d) debase

4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’.
a) Find peace in times of difficulty.
b) To remain calm and not to lose hope.
c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

I claim that many Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient is a complicated one. While it's true that many people in Africa do have inadequate access to nutritious food, it's not necessarily because their farms are stagnant or inefficient. In many cases, it's due to a lack of access to clean water and sanitation, a lack of education about healthy eating, and poverty. Additionally, many farms in Africa are smallholder farms, which means that they are limited in terms of what they can produce and how much they can invest in improving their efficiency.
