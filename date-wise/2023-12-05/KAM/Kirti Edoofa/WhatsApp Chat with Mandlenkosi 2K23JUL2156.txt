02/08/23, 8:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/08/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes we can ma'am
02/08/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/08/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 715 2664: We are done ma'am
02/08/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/08/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/08/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes they are
02/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/08/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/08/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes I'm following ma'am
02/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/08/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes ma'am it sounds clear
02/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes please
02/08/23, 8:54 pm - +27 60 332 4572: Good evening
02/08/23, 8:55 pm - +27 60 332 4572: Sorry I'm not feeling well won't be able to join but Mr Moyo the father is with you,, you may proceed
02/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Surely she is not feeling well, my apologies for not relaying the info Ms Kirti
02/08/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, may I know what happened?
02/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 715 2664: She is experiencing some fever. I guess it's duevto colds that are being witnessed in South Africa
02/08/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I am sorry to hear that, and I hope he recovers soon. In the meantime shall we continue ahead with the discussion?
02/08/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Please let's continue
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
02/08/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
02/08/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 715 2664: The videos in the first instance explains how critical it is for the students to be teachable and be able to follow instructions from Edoofa. Edoofa is mind transformative education, it creates the feeling of independence on students. Edoofa has robust systems for ensuring that students get the best out the education program that altmately improves the capacities of the learners. They bost of years of experience which is paying dividends - students are passing with flying colors, overtime they created a network of well accredited universities in India where edoofians are placed for the right kind of knowledge, attitude and skills. The SOP is very critical as the learner will get an opportunity to convince the admission board why they should admit him in that program of study. Application form should be taken seriously, completed on time with efficacy.
03/08/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Mandlenkosi.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Well understood
03/08/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
03/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Thank you
03/08/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
03/08/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
03/08/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. O-Level Results*

*2. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
03/08/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Thank you Ms Kirti, Mandlenkosi is traveling from school. They just closed today and will be arriving late. So, to complete the assignment by 9pm today might be a challenge. How about tomorrow at by 9pm?
03/08/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
03/08/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Thank you for your understanding ma'am Kirti
03/08/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
04/08/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mandlenkosi.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by now?
04/08/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Good evening Ms Kirti
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Good evening Ms Kirti
04/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you all are doing well, may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by now?
04/08/23, 10:03 pm - +27 60 332 4572: Good evening Ms Kirti
04/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you were able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by now?
04/08/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Ms Kirti may you be patient with me as I am  having network problems. But I am almost done filling the SOP form
04/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response.
04/08/23, 11:23 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Ms Kirti I am done
04/08/23, 11:25 pm - +263 78 964 6893: <Media omitted>
05/08/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Good afternoon Ms Kirti I just uploaded my documents
05/08/23, 12:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, may I know when will you be able to share the documents here with us?
05/08/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 964 6893: <Media omitted>
05/08/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 964 6893: <Media omitted>
05/08/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
05/08/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
05/08/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Design (Film and TV Production) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
05/08/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Yes Ms Kirti
05/08/23, 12:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
05/08/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Yes we can start
05/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
05/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
05/08/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
05/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 715 2664: 😀😀 Very true, one will have to make a single choice.
05/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
05/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
05/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
05/08/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes she did
05/08/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2700-$3700 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
05/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Yes
05/08/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
05/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Let's proceed ma'am
07/08/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 715 2664: Greetings to everyone, hope everyone is okay.
07/08/23, 6:54 pm - +27 60 332 4572: Good evening Mr Moyo and everyone
08/08/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
08/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 964 6893: I am following Ms Kirti u may proceed
08/08/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
08/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 964 6893: No queries Ms Kirti
08/08/23, 2:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have no queries. Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
08/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Understood Ms Kirti
08/08/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day ahead!
08/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 964 6893: thank you very much Ms Kirti
08/08/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

09/09/23, 10:03 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Mandlenkosi,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Mandlenkosi's higher education?
09/09/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 715 2664: Good day Ms Kirti and your team. Thank you so much for the wonderful work you are doing for   our children. General the economic situation is not all that good in our country. This situation is already having a negative impact in the quality of education. Teachers, lecturers and other ancillary personnel staff are leaving the country in en masse. So the standard of education is highly compromised. The only source of hope for the future of our children education now lies in other countries and in programmes like Edoofa. We will always remain ready to sacrifice for the education of our son Mandlenkosi.
19/10/23, 5:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mandlenkosi.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?

3. Then out of several offer letters from different universities we can make a choice of the university where we want our child to study considering factors such as affordability, rank of the university....
4. Registration fee will have to be made which may range between USD500 to USD 750.
21/10/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes I do  Ms Kirti

21/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 715 2664: We are good to go
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

21/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 939 0324: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Mandlenkosi,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. With regard to our messages yesterday, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes Ms Kirti
23/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
23/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
23/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
23/10/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
23/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 939 0324: I have gone through them Ms Kirti
23/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
23/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
23/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Mandlenkosi, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
23/10/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 939 0324: I get it
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
23/10/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
23/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Understood Ms Kirti
23/10/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600
23/10/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
23/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 939 0324: That's amazing Ms Kirti.. I clearly understand
23/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
23/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
23/10/23, 4:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Mandlenkosi,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
25/10/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 939 0324: No Ms Kirti we can continue
25/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 45 students have already secured their seats, leaving 55 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes Ms Kirti can't wait
25/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Thank you Ms Kirti
27/11/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Mandlenkosi,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *PDM University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
27/11/23, 10:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
27/11/23, 10:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mandlenkosi,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 6:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Good evening everyone...
28/11/23, 6:19 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes I got the chance to go through the offer letter but there is a mistake Ms kirti
28/11/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you were able to go through the letter, may I know what mistake are you referring to?
28/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 71 939 0324: The course that I am being offered isn't the course I want to do
28/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand please, thank you for letting me know that it must be a clerical error by the university, thank you for pointing out the same, we have updated the team about the same, and they will get the letter updated, please. However, please do not worry, since the cost of the course mentioned is correct, we can discuss the letter in detail, may I know if this sounds acceptable?
28/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Thank you very much Ms kirti this sounds amazing
28/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
28/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Understood
28/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes please
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
28/11/23, 6:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 71 939 0324: 1.My per semester tuition fee after the scholarship is USD1315
2. The standard duration of my course is 3 years
3. Registration fee is $750
28/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1315, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2565. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
28/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes Ms kirti
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
28/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2315 ($1315 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
28/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes clearly explained Ms kirti
28/11/23, 7:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
28/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Great Ms kirti
28/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
28/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
28/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes it is clear Ms kirti
28/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see you together for the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
28/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2315. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1315, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.
28/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make his/her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
28/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes Ms kirti
28/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:
28/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
28/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.
28/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
28/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Clearly explained Ms kirti
28/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as December 11, 2023.
28/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
28/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes please
28/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of December 11th, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of January 11th, 2024 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures that your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 11th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Now it is clearly explained
28/11/23, 10:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
28/11/23, 10:47 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Same to you  Ms kirti
29/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Mandlenkosi.

30/11/23, 9:16 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Good evening Ms kirti.. I am free we can continue with the discussion
30/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please we can connect if you are actively available.
30/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Yes I am available Ms kirti
30/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
30/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
30/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 71 939 0324: I stay in Bulawayo
30/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
30/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
30/11/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
30/11/23, 9:40 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Thank you Ms kirti for making this process easier, my parents will do the transactions
30/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
30/11/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter.
30/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Understood Ms kirti
30/11/23, 9:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
30/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 71 939 0324: Okey Ms kirti, before we move on may you give me an update about the issue regarding the *mistake about the course*
30/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263719390324 the update is shared with the university by the team, as soon as we receive an update we shall notify you, please do not worry.
