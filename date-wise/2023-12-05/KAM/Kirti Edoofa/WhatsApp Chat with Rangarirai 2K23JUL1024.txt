I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
26/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Pleasant day madam
26/10/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 312 4510: As the parent I'm available
26/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Unfortunately when I lost my phone all my valuable information got lost. Would you mind furnish me with some of the valuable basic information for my quick recall and general revision
26/10/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
26/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 312 4510: You may proceed madam
26/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
26/10/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
26/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Thank you for ringing the bell once, seems I'm recalling that now. If there's further important information you feel I may need revision as a parent you are free to remind
26/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
26/10/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
26/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Clearly explained you may proceed madam
26/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education. Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
26/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 312 4510: So far so good if there's anything that may arise I will definitely seek your explanation
26/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
26/10/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 312 4510: I'm understanding the procedure as you are clearly explaining
26/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
26/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 312 4510: You may proceed
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
26/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Rangarirai, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
26/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 312 4510: You may go ahead
26/10/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Ok, amazing makes budgeting easier
26/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Well understood
26/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/10/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 312 4510: If there's anything that may arise I'll ask on our next session
26/10/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 312 4510: There's a special admission process extended to Edoofians by universities to kick start the process
26/10/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through the message above?
26/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 312 4510: I did go through it, unless I missed some points you may clarify
26/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
26/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Cleared
26/10/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Well explained
26/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Yes
26/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Yes
26/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 10:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 10:32 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Cleared
26/10/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Ok well explained
26/10/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Seems everything is well explained
26/10/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Rangarirai's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Rangarirai is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 312 4510: Let me hear them
26/10/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand you well here?
26/10/23, 10:52 pm - +263 77 312 4510: I would be happy to know the next steps for the offer letter
26/10/23, 10:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

20/11/23, 6:14 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Okay noted
20/11/23, 6:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are able to connect with us now?
20/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Yes am connected
20/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
20/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
20/11/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok go ahead
20/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok noted
20/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please share your response to the above questions asked.
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 889 2415: 1. 1000usd
2. 4 years
3. 25 usd
4. 750 usd
20/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 889 2415: If i did some of them wrong am glad if you assist me
20/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $1000, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $1000 * 2) is $2000. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
20/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 889 2415: So I will be paying 2000usd per year?
20/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
20/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
20/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
20/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Hence on top of 2000usd per year i will pay another 2000 usd for accommodation ?
20/11/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the tuition and accommodation are two different things, 
The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $2000 to $3000. Our students go for off-campus accommodation since it provides the same benefits an on-campus accommodation at a cheaper cost which will make your per annum accommodation cost of $800, hence making your overall cost within the same range of $2000-$3000.
20/11/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You can go through the message and share your thoughts and we will be discussing the same tomorrow at 06:00 pm since our available hours for today are now over, so we will be connecting with you tomorrow.
21/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, since our available hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm, I hope you will be available considering there is a deadline as well with the offer letter, I hope you will prioritize this discussion. I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 06:00 pm.
22/11/23, 6:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Rangarirai.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
22/11/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mam good evening
22/11/23, 7:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
23/11/23, 1:37 am - +263 71 889 2415: Am here to discuss
You may proceed
23/11/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rangarirai.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead towards the next step?
23/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mentor
24/11/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rangarirai.

I hope you are doing well and this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
24/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Yes am available
24/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
24/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Yeah clear on that
24/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
24/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Okay clear
24/11/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
24/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok you may proceed
24/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
24/11/23, 6:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
24/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Are there any other universities rather than that one you suggested
24/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
24/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
24/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
24/11/23, 6:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias  and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
24/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 889 2415: I have been calculating all the money cost so its about $5000usd per right approx
24/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 889 2415: 　okay i will be waiting for others
24/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Thank you for the explanation
24/11/23, 6:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please, I will be explaining you the cost break down as we move ahead, do not worry.
24/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
24/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 71 889 2415: No am not
24/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok mam lets break it down
24/11/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
24/11/23, 6:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
24/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Oo okay
24/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please now coming to the break down of the cost, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
24/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 71 889 2415: So the EWYL is not able to reduce this amount ?
24/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
24/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
24/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
24/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
24/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Okay sounds good
24/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
24/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $3000 - $1000 = $2000, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
24/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
24/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 889 2415: It clarifies indeed thank you
24/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
24/11/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
25/11/23, 8:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Rangarirai.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, with regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to continue with our discussion ahead may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mentor
27/11/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rangarirai

I hope you're doing well and you had a great weekend since we were not available yesterday because of the weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
27/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mentor
27/11/23, 7:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263718892415 I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
27/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok mam i am sorry i was busy packing and traveling back from school
27/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, that the discussion stands at equal importance, if you are not available, please let me know if your parents are available to connect?
27/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ok mam
27/11/23, 7:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so may I know if you are clear so far?
27/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Its clear mam
27/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
27/11/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
27/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
27/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ooooh okay
27/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 889 2415: What if i don't happen to pay before before 28 November
27/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand however, that the deadline is something that is given by the university itself, and the letter was shared with you on the 14th of November we have only been able to start discussing the letter on and off because you are not available to connect with us, during the initial days you were not connected please and if we do not abide by the universities deadline, the university shall revoke the offer letter, however, if you have any concerns then please I would suggest you to be transparent with us so that I will be able to assist you in the best possible way?
27/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 71 889 2415: What measures are taken
27/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Okay mam i understand you
27/11/23, 9:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
27/11/23, 11:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond.

28/11/23, 4:29 am - +263 77 312 4510: Okay
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rangarirai.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rangarirai.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication since the university closes the round of applications on the 31st of this month and I will not be able to assist you after that?
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mam
28/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 889 2415: The money isn't yet available i thought it would be needed after the examinations results are out
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand your challenges. While I empathize with you, you have to understand that you have applied for an International Scholarship, and there are certain rules of the scholarship that must be respected. Students all over the world are competing for this scholarship opportunity, and while we wish to assist you, the university has to be fair to reach every student.
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Considering that you are a student under the Edoofa Program, and we have made a promise to help you secure your scholarship seat, we can once again have a discussion with the university officials and see what can be done to allow you an extension until 28th December to secure your scholarship seat. However, given that you have also been granted the Endowment Grant of $150, it might not be possible for you to retain all the benefits.
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In such a case, I believe as a parent, you have to make a decision. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 28th December, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $150, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, sir, that cannot be done if you do not understand the importance of these due dates.
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 889 2415: That would help a lot mam
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Let i discuss with them
28/11/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please may I know if you were able to have a discussion with your parents by now since I was waiting for your response the whole evening?
29/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication since the university closes the round of applications on the 30th of this month and I will not be able to assist you after that?
29/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Yes mam we discussed
29/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Is it not possible to fit in into the next batch of students?
29/11/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, being your admission officer I am committed to assisting you and understanding the challenges that you are facing, and for you, I will once again have a discussion with the academic board so that they can help us figure out a way for you, however, for that, I would like to understand how much will you be able to raise in by the 15th of December, please?
29/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 889 2415: You would have helped a lot mam thank you
29/11/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.  I am taking an extra step because I do not want you to miss out on this opportunity so I will be discussing this with the Academic Board for that I would need your confirmation that you will be able to deposit the first installment before the 15th of December.
30/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mam
30/11/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, I was occupied with a meeting. Let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm for our discussion please.
01/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mentor
01/12/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Rangarirai.

I hope you are doing well. Since we were not able to have a discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can have a discussion?
01/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Yes i am available
01/12/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
01/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 889 2415: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
01/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 889 2415: This is the discussion we had with Mr Shubham earlier when we started the Edoofa program. He said the admission will be done when the final A level results are out. But this is not what is happening now. Please mam can you clarify better or shade more light on that one because we were attached to these words
01/12/23, 1:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely Let me help you understand, and help you clear your concern. If you recall our last discussion for a student to attain a 50% scholarship he/ she would be required to at least have 2E grades. However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are clear?
01/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 889 2415: That is clear,
meaning Mr Shubham did not paint it out there

That means i have to pay $750 irregardless if the results are not yet out?. Isn't part of admission mentioned by Mr Shubham.
I am sorry am taking you back
01/12/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that you might not recall the discussions from the counseling sessions since it has been a while now, let me help you understand. The $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Ooh okay thank you
01/12/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please so now may I know if you are clear so far?
01/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 889 2415: Yeah clear now so i 750 is taken from $2000 the tuition fee <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 3:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, and since under the Endownment Plan, you have been granted a $150 grant by Edoofa, so your registration fee comes to total of $600, which can be paid within two installments of $300 each.
02/12/23, 8:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning to Parents and Rangarirai,

I trust you are in good health. I've been eagerly anticipating your response to my previous message. However, I understand that you may not have had the opportunity to reply just yet. If convenient for you, could you kindly confirm whether our communication is still ongoing? Your confirmation would be appreciated.
02/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 889 2415: Hello mentor
02/12/23, 11:23 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

Yes i am available
04/12/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to connect with you again. With regard to our conversation earlier, now that you are clear why the registration fee is needed and how you can even pay in two installments, so may I know if you will be able to deposit your first installment by the 15th of December since your deadline is already crossed, however, here I am trying to assist you so that you do not lose this opportunity.
04/12/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. As my available hours for today are over I hope you will be available tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm. Looking forward to connecting with you have a great evening ahead.
