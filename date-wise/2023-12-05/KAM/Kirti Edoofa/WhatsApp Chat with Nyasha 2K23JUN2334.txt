I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.

18/09/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam we can go and I was waiting for that one
18/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/09/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.

19/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Nyasha,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 02.30 P.M. I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Good afternoon Mam , how are you. It's Nyasha am using my Mom's phone mine is out of bundle

20/09/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright, and indeed it was lovely to finally meet them in person, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Am fine here Mam and that's very nice. Yes am available we can proceed
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now with great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/09/23, 3:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
20/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 423 1238: It's very nice and am getting it Mam
20/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Am done reading them Mam and we can proceed with the explanation
20/09/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -

1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Yes Mam that is am going to have a conversation with the selected university representatives right
20/09/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263784231238 I think you misunderstood the message here, here what I mean to say is that on the basis of Nyasha's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them and then you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.

 I hope you are clear on this point?
20/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 423 1238: It's Nyasha Mam am using my Mom's phone as mine is out of bundle

I got you right now Mam
20/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Oh thank you for letting me know that, I thought I was having a conversation with your mother. 

2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/09/23, 3:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Am following Mam
20/09/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 423 1238: We're together going
20/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Yes Mam I got you
20/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/09/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Ok I get it Mam
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Yes Mam I get that point of  advantage
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Wow Mam I get it
20/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 423 1238: We're together Mam
20/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 423 1238: It's clear Mam, your explanations are very understandable
20/09/23, 3:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are able to understand everything clearly. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 423 1238: For all the information that you've supplied me am left with no question because the explanation was excellent
20/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Nyasha. Now as Nyasha's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Nyasha is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam as for me am really excited to be part of it and I'll now leave a room for my parents to discuss about it and come back to you with the response
21/09/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that. Yes I am surely looking forward to their response, may I know by when can I expect a response from your parents so that we can share the update with the team as well?
21/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I'll do that today and tomorrow I'll send you my response right away
21/09/23, 3:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright I shall wait for your response.
22/09/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 655 3182: How are you Mam. I am Nyasha's father and I am really glad about the offerings that the Edoofa and it's director Mr Engad Singh are giving us and our son. May you always consider all responses given to you by Nyasha pertaining us as we would have discussed everything. Moreso, I appreciate all the effort you are putting in making him secure a recognised post in his higher education and also his life and we are going to work tirelessly inorder to make Edoofa team proud.  Conclusively, I would like you to go ahead with all the processes you are undergoing as we are now prepared to receiving the offer letter. I have used Nyasha's phone since mine has a technical fault I am working on. Thank you.
22/09/23, 3:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that with me, that is alright please I understand the technical issue. The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
22/09/23, 11:01 pm - +263 71 655 3182: My father have send his response and he said let's go it as we had been waiting for this moment
23/09/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 655 3182: We're doing great Mam and we've really noted it right. We are waiting for the response from the University
25/09/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Here's my father's response Mam
25/09/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you earlier, as it was the weekend hence we were not available. Yes please I have gone through your father's response and as I stated above Nyasha the University will now take up to 3-5 days time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
25/09/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Am well Mam and I've noted it well. So they'll contact me through you or directly
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please the university will email you the offer letter, and if we received the offer letter before, we will share it here with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasi
17/11/23, 6:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
17/11/23, 6:23 pm - +263 78 423 1238: How are you mam. I am Nyasha Muhoma's father and firstly I would like to thank the Edoofans and Director for the opportunities you are offering my beloved son. Secondly, I am now on line as per your request our mentor Good evening everyone there
17/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and thank you for your kind words. I am looking forward to connecting with you now.
17/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
17/11/23, 6:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
17/11/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 655 3182: How are you Mam. We're right online with my Father
17/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam and now we're on network for the discussion and get a bit of understanding about the process to go well
17/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 423 1238: It's OK fine as to my understanding, we are required to pay a sum of 700USD in order for Nyasha to go further. In the previous discussions Edoofa had promised to cater for 150USD which is to be subtracted from the 700USD for us to pay 550USD currently. Is it?
17/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please that is correct, and we will be discussing everything one by one in detail please, so I would encourage you to be patient please and I shall wait for your response to the above questions?
17/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 655 3182: 1. $1 225

2. 8 semesters that is 4 years

3. $200

4. $700
17/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 4-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 8 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
17/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Yes Mam I've noted that one correctly
17/11/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -

*1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
17/11/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
17/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Ok Mam 
1) 1225usd per semester
2) 4years course duration
3) 200usd processing fee
4) 700usd registration fee
This is according to my understanding. Thank you
17/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok I've noted that one Mam
17/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 71 655 3182: So does this means I've to pay this additional fee myself or it is covered by my scholarship
17/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam so do you mean there are no these facilities like wifi in the University campus
17/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 655 3182: On this one students do not get food from the University right
17/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better. The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $2000 to $3000 in support, it's not solely designated for tuition; it's inclusive of all other vital aspects of your education journey.

This support is intended to not only cover your tuition expenses but also cater to your accommodation and nourishment needs, ensuring a comprehensive support system for your educational pursuits. I hope I am clear on this?
17/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Our students prefer to stay off-campus since it is a lot cheaper, and the students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well. Let me also inform you that food, basic electricity wifi, and water charges are also included in off-campus accommodation as well,  if you as parents are concerned about the safety of the students off-campus. I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
17/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
17/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 71 655 3182: So do mean if I pay $2 450 per year it will cover for my other basic needs like food , Wi-Fi and accommodation
17/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ok Mam it an advantage part to stay off campus right. And still if I choose to stay in campus or off campus I'll still get covered by the scholarship but if I am in campus I can't cook for myself if the food in inadequate
17/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I noted this one Mam
17/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263716553182 the per semester cost mentioned in your offer letter will be covering your tuition only please, and whatever option you choose for your accommodation is different, we suggest off- campus since it is cheaper for our students, and when the students stay near each other they feel at home with the same environment.
17/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Ok, According to my understanding if we pay the 2450usd per year it will cater for all basics like food, accommodation WiFi etc and its by his own choice to stay in the campus or outside. Thank you
17/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Ol now I get it Mam but when I was going through those manuals of Edoofa they were stating that things like accommodation are covered by my scholarship and now it's different so am a bit confused
17/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 423 1238: So, apart from the tuition fee of 2450usd there is an additional of 1000usd for off campus basic needs to make 3450usd all and all per year. Is it?
17/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Hello Mam
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand which manuals are you referring to ?
17/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 655 3182: The ones that were sent to me earlier during my counseling sessions
17/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 423 1238: May you kindly give me the reply
17/11/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that Nyasha, as I have mentioned above scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses to be catered by the student/ parent. Since LPU is a renowned university in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
17/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 423 1238: Ok I get you now
17/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
17/11/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

*LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
18/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope this message finds you well. I was hoping to get a response from you, now I understand that you might have been having thoughts about our discussion yesterday, however, I would really appreciate it if you shared the same with us, we have waited so long and worked so hard for this letter since LPU is one the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide. However, our aim is your satisfaction as well you must be satisfied with the university you get so please I would like you to share your thoughts with us as we are here to assist you and want the best for you.
21/11/23, 11:06 pm - +263 71 655 3182: How are you Mam. Am sorry for replying late, we've been digesting this issue of mine with my parents and they couldn't afford to come up with the specified bills for me to commence my education next year there in India and so am sorry Mam am withdrawing from the scholarship. Thank you may God bless you 🙏
23/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Nyasha.

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for asking, however, I am not doing that well due to a cold. However, I completely understand what you are trying to say here, I really appreciate you being transparent with us. However, please understand that LPU is one of the best universities in India, and getting a scholarship abroad that too in one of the best universities is really important, let us discuss whatever concerns you have in your mind, and maybe we can help you come up with payment plan or a different solution. I hope to connect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm, since I am not well today so I will be connecting tomorrow.
23/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I am very well Mam and am very sorry for you , may God grant you a quick and speedy recovery. Yeah I completely get what you're saying Mam and o top of that for the first time I can pay up the fees and some bills but when it comes to the following year there will be a problem with me because I've two siblings of mine that are going to school so I can see that will come to be a burden to my parents. Don't know if you are getting my sense
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your concern, I am feeling much better now, and I completely understand what you are trying to say here, as per my understanding what you mean to say is that you are able to register yourself with the university, but for the long run you do not know if your parents will be able to assist you because you even have two siblings to look after, may I know if my understanding is right here?
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:30 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead. <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 8:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, with regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to continue with our discussion ahead may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/11/23, 10:41 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I am so good Mam and how's everything there. I mean as for myself I couldn't but my parents are the ones who wanted to cater for the bills but due to the high amount they're unable to lift it because my siblings as well are on there course to school so thus become a load to them
25/11/23, 10:49 pm - +263 71 655 3182: How are you Mam my self I am in good spirits and am sorry for not being online during the day due to some tight schedules of myself hustling around to get something to mouth and am getting online late like this hour Mam
27/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great. That is alright please I understand that you must be occupied with work and I was able to go through your messages and I completely agree with what you are saying, if I would have been at your place I would have the same thought process, however, withdrawing from the scholarship will not be giving you solutions to your concern Nyasha. 

LPU is one of the universities that had been offered to you and I understand that cost can be a little high for your parents to raise, considering the economic challenges, however, that is how the EWYL program is here to help you make your education even more affordable.
27/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
27/11/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 655 3182: Am doing fine Mam. And I completely understand why you're saying Mam and it's been a process gone through and calculations have been taken and so by that my parents are under hard to time to work for the fees instead I would have not withdrawn but I've no option Mam if it was not the financial crisis I whole heatedly wanted to be in the Edoofian community and maybe one day after leveling all these irregularities ill come there and go together Mam
28/11/23, 10:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand your concern,  we understand what you are saying, and let me tell you that your dream does not end here Nyasha, you can still pursue your education in India, at an affordable cost, this is a benefit enrolling with Edoofa, that we offer the students to change their course since your A- level results have an O point as well, which restricts your eligibility criteria, however, you still have the option to change your course, in the similar field, and pursue your dream in India, you can response to this message once you are able to go through the message and share your response once we connect tomorrow at 12:30 pm
29/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyahsa.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 655 3182: I've duely noted it Mam and I hope to come up again very soon and this is not the end of it but am about to start so journey commences now Mam. That's how life goes and not everything we like comes the way we like but this makes us stronger in some aspects. By God's grace we go and still find a way out Mam don't worry
30/11/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 655 3182: Am fine Mam and am sorry my online time nowadays is mostly at night during the day am tightened up by my works
30/11/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, @263716553182 Thank you for sharing that, I have taken note of your response and I shall get back to you tomorrow please, since it is very late here in India now, and my available hours for today are now over, so let us reconnect tomorrow.
