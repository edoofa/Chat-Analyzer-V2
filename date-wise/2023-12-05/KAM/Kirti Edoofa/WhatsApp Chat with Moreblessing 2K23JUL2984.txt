18/08/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that.  Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
18/08/23, 8:37 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Okay sure Ms Kirti
18/08/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 652 3280: I'm sorry for late connection with you
18/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Sure Ms Kirti
18/08/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
18/08/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
18/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 652 3280: They are clear
18/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
18/08/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
18/08/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Yes sure
18/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
18/08/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
18/08/23, 9:13 pm - +263 71 652 3280: It is clear but how the fees will be made
18/08/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263716523280 please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
18/08/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Yes sure
18/08/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Yes we can
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
18/08/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
18/08/23, 9:31 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Ms Kirti as for now I'm using WhatsApp bundle so I can not be able to connect to YouTube for now
18/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand, can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by Monday 01.00 pm?

30/08/23, 12:04 pm - +263 71 652 3280: In this video two  let me brief on what I got ,The founders hve been talking about the vision ,plans and wishes they have for us  ,as part of the Edoofa there is only school from china and has being talking about the interview being done by the provincial manager ,
They also found something really interesting wen introducing the acceptance letter which is an apportunity fr the student to be in Edoofa program and $1000 paid by that time and also a $300 for the shipping of documents from china
It’s not jus an aim that Edoofa has to admit us ,but to provide high education for low student and employability and they have pictures of edoofian and from those pictures they take advantage of a boy from Africa who received a scholarship and it was fully funded and they also encourage students to follow instructions so that if you get a chance you might receive a scholarship
30/08/23, 12:04 pm - +263 71 652 3280: On this they have been talking about the Next step which is the statement of property
SOP is not only a subjective document tt gives opportunity to students to convince admission  board to get  scholarship 
SOP includes  your vision , the reason why you have  been chosen, why you  are seeking admission in that particular school ,why you choose the particular course and the next step is the filling of the  form offered by Admission scheme and they also said that being resourceful may also be the reason to bring a child in India
30/08/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Sorry for late reply Ms Kirti as I said before that my phone is misbehaving veru sorry for the delay
30/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright, I understand. Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
30/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
30/08/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
30/08/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Yes sure Ms Kirti
30/08/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
30/08/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Okay Ms Kirti
30/08/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
30/08/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

30/08/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 pm.
30/08/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
30/08/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 652 3280: <Media omitted>
30/08/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the identity proof, may I know by when will you be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks?
30/08/23, 9:07 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Due to power cuts I wasn't able to fill the SOP form the Zimbabwe's economy is not politically stable so its also affecting us Ms Kirti
30/08/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, however, I have gone through the link and it is live and active. I believe you might be having technical difficulties on your end. May I suggest you to please try it again from another device?
30/08/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 652 3280: The relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development is a strong and symbiotic one. Entrepreneurship is often considered a key driver of economic development as it creates new businesses, jobs, and innovation. Here are a few ways in which entrepreneurship contributes to economic development:

Entrepreneurs start new businesses, which in turn create employment opportunities. As these businesses grow, they require more employees, leading to reduced unemployment rates and increased incomes.

Entrepreneurs are known for their ability to identify gaps in the market and develop innovative solutions. Through their entrepreneurial ventures, they introduce new products, services, and technologies, which contribute to economic growth and overall development.

Entrepreneurial ventures often lead to increased productivity and efficiency, resulting in economic growth. By introducing new ideas, processes, and products, entrepreneurs stimulate competition, which drives economic expansion.

Successful entrepreneurial ventures generate profits and wealth for the business owners and investors. This wealth can then be reinvested into the economy, creating a cycle of investment, growth, and development.

Entrepreneurship can play a significant role in regional development, especially in underdeveloped or rural areas. By starting businesses in these regions, entrepreneurs can attract investment, create employment opportunities, and contribute to the overall development of the area.

Overall, entrepreneurship fosters economic development by creating jobs, driving innovation, stimulating economic growth, generating wealth, and addressing social challenges.

30/08/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 652 3280: GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. It refers to a set of accounting standards and principles that are widely recognized and followed in the United States. These principles provide a standardized framework for financial reporting, ensuring consistency, comparability, and transparency in financial statements.

The importance of GAAP lies in its ability to provide reliable and accurate financial information to stakeholders such as investors, creditors, and regulators. Here are a few reasons why GAAP is crucial:

GAAP ensures that financial statements are prepared using consistent accounting methods, facilitating comparisons between different companies and industries.

GAAP requires companies to disclose relevant and reliable financial information, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

Companies that adhere to GAAP are more likely to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, reducing the risk of penalties and legal issues.

GAAP-compliant financial statements provide investors with reliable information about a company's financial health and performance, enabling them to assess investment opportunities accurately

While GAAP is specific to the United States, its principles have influenced accounting standards globally. Many countries have adopted or converged their accounting standards with GAAP, making it easier for multinational companies to prepare consolidated financial statements.

Overall, GAAP plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and comparability of financial information and also fostering trust among stakeholders.
30/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents and I shall wait for your response to the rest of the questions.
30/08/23, 9:33 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Accounting standards are a set of principles, rules, and guidelines that govern how financial statements should be prepared and presented. They provide a framework for companies to consistently report their financial information, ensuring transparency and comparability among different entities.

Accounting standards are mandatory for several reasons:

They promote uniformity in financial reporting, enabling stakeholders to make reliable comparisons across different companies and industries. This is crucial for investors, creditors, and other users of financial statements to make informed decisions.

Accounting standards ensure that financial information is presented in a clear and understandable manner, reducing the risk of misleading or ambiguous statements. They enhance the transparency of financial reporting, helping to build trust and confidence in the financial markets.

By following accounting standards, companies can demonstrate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Governments and regulatory bodies rely on these standards to ensure that financial information is accurate, reliable, and compliant with relevant laws and regulations.

Accounting standards promote international comparability of financial statements, facilitating cross-border transactions and investments. 

Accounting standards serve the interests of various stakeholders, such as shareholders, lenders, employees, and the general public. They provide a framework that protects the rights of stakeholders by ensuring that companies report their financial information accurately and fairly.
30/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the answers, I shall wait for your response for questions 1 and 5.
30/08/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Sure
30/08/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I shall wait for them.
30/08/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 652 3280: Accounting and auditing are both essential functions in the field of finance, but they have distinct roles and purposes. 

Here are the key differences between accounting and auditing:

Accounting involves the recording, summarizing, analyzing, and reporting of financial transactions and information. It focuses on the preparation and maintenance of financial statements, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements whereas Auditing is the process of examining and evaluating financial records, statements, and systems to ensure their accuracy, completeness, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. It involves independent verification and assessment of financial information to provide assurance to stakeholders

Accounting covers a broad range of activities, including recording financial transactions, maintaining general ledgers, preparing financial statements, analyzing financial data, budgeting, and taxation whilist Auditing focuses on the examination and verification of financial records and systems. It includes evaluating internal controls, testing financial transactions, assessing compliance with laws and regulations, identifying risks, and providing recommendations for improvement.

Accounting is an ongoing process that occurs throughout the year as transactions happen. It involves regular recording, summarizing, and reporting of financial information whereas Auditing is typically conducted at specific intervals, such as annually or quarterly. It is performed after the accounting process is complete and financial statements are prepared.

In summary, accounting focuses on the preparation and analysis of financial information, while auditing involves independent verification and assessment of that information to provide assurance and credibility. Both disciplines are important for organizations to maintain financial transparency and accountability.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from your side, however, you did not respond, so may I know if you are able to connect with us now?
11/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
11/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
11/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Commerce, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
11/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes sure Ms Kirti
11/09/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
11/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes we can Ms Kirti
11/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/09/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/09/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/09/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes Ms Kirti its not possible
11/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 284 6426: So it must be paid after receiving the offerletter
11/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes Mr Piyush said a bit of that but to myself I didn't exactly get it
11/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed you are absolutely correct, Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes
11/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
11/09/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes Ms Kirti
11/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
11/09/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
11/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 284 6426: So meaning I'll be paying all this by myself as required
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed, let me help you understand, please. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/09/23, 10:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/09/23, 10:47 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay I understand Ms Kirti
11/09/23, 10:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the process now we start with the next step which I am sure you will be very excited to begin we are prepared to initiate your EWYL Program in September which is tomorrow.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction and let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time.
11/09/23, 10:52 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay Ms Kirti

13/09/23, 9:13 pm - +263 78 284 6426: The question is that is it possible that admission can be done in Dec Ms Kirti
13/09/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263782846426, the academic year in India commences only in the month of August, please.
13/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes i was asking of this year Ms Kirti regarding the payments of enrollment to the university
13/09/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I really appreciate you being so transparent here with us so let me help you understand, that the entire admission process to complete will take 10 days if you are financially prepared. 

So I would like to have a confirmation from your side, that you are mentally and financially prepared for your admission fee and travel expenses from Zimbabwe to India, if you want an October 2023 intake?
13/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 284 6426: My question was regarding this issue you said about the payments I should make after receiving offer letter from university Ms Kirti
13/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 284 6426: For now my parent are not prepared for this my wish is to go for it next year on August Ms Kirti and it is to mu hope that all exepses I will settle it by myself
13/09/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263782846426 Kindly excuse me I misunderstood your questions here. Let me help you explain, The breakdown here, only explains the cost that you would need to cater, and as we move forward we will let you know all the details step by step, please.
13/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay I was talking to my parents regarding that cost registration cosy you said should be paid immediately after receiving offer letter and asked when is this going to take place
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I understand, I would please encourage you to be patient as we are about to discuss about it in detail.
13/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay sure
13/09/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 284 6426: No Ms Kirti wasn't
13/09/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 10:09 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Year sure 
For them to prepare for it assuming when could it be required
13/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Sure you can tell
13/09/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 11:27 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay Ms Kirti I understand same here meaning this Can be done after I receive the results
14/09/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?
14/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 78 284 6426: I wasn't the one using the phone sorry Ms Kirti
14/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, since our available working hours our almost over now, I would like to reconnect with you tomorrow at 02.00 p.m. I hope you will be available.
14/09/23, 10:40 pm - +263 78 284 6426: I'll surely try to do so
15/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes Ms Kirti I'm here now
15/09/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for the delay in response, as I was attending a meeting may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes sure Ms Kirti
15/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
15/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 284 6426: No ms Kirti
15/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
15/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
15/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
15/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes ms Kirti
15/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
15/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
15/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 284 6426: So the scholarship meaning there will be part of my fees paid by the university
16/09/23, 9:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded it was almost past our available hours, so we could not get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us?
16/09/23, 9:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand, Certainly @263782846426 when we delve into the realm of scholarships, it is essential to emphasize that a significant portion of your fees will be covered directly by the university. 

It is also worth recalling that the cost of education in India typically ranges from $6000 to $8000. However, with the invaluable assistance of the Edoofa scholarship program, this substantial amount is substantially reduced, bringing it down to a mere $2000 to $3000. This remarkable reduction underscores the transformative impact of our scholarships on your educational journey.
16/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay Ms Kirti
19/09/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Moreblessing,

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, may I know how are can we have a smooth conversation please the discussion would take 1 hour of your time, however, if you will not be available to connect then we can not move ahead with the admission process and we are just delaying the process even more. 

I hope you understand and take out at least 1 hour of your time for the discussions.
17/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I trust you are doing well. I was looking forward to receiving a response from you yesterday, but unfortunately, I didn't hear back. I did, however, notice that you had the opportunity to review my message. Could you please confirm if we are still connected? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 1:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa*. In the past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end.

We acknowledge that you have exams going on which is making it difficult for you to connect, however, even after letting you know that parents can attend the discussions on your behalf you and your parent were still not available to respond and hence I  think there might be underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing your absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.
18/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024. Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage.
18/10/23, 1:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged us to reach out once more, extending an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns, which have been hindering your communication with the team. Our aim is to address these issues and provide you with the necessary guidance and solutions. Your participation is vital in ensuring your continued progress in this journey @263782846426 @263785914018.
19/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Good evening Ms Kirti, I hope I found you well
19/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Regarding my absence on the admission journey , it is my concern that i have completed this, however due to constraints which are worsening it. I wish I could be available by the time that is required by Ms Kirti I really apologize for all that
19/10/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening.

I hope this message finds you well, I completely understand you here, however, despite me letting you know that parents can also attend the discussion on your behalf, we have still recieved delays, in your process, may I know the reason behind your parent not connecting with us please, if you can not be transparent with us here, I may not be able to assist you please understand.
20/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you however it seems like you are not available to respond, your absence has been having a negative impact on Moreblessing's scholarship, I hope you are aware that the 2024 admissions are now open through Edoofa, and these delays will make Moreblessing behind the peers, which is not a good sign, may I know if we are still connected?
20/10/23, 11:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Moreblessing,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
21/10/23, 1:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and weekend ahead.
22/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 284 6426: I'm sorry for my absence Ms Kirti. Good day
23/10/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Moreblessing,

I trust this message finds all of you in excellent health and high spirits. As we discussed in our previous messages, we were eager to connect with you and discuss essential matters concerning your university admission process. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a discussion at this time?
25/10/23, 1:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Moreblessing,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time? <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
27/10/23, 12:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing that with me, may I know if @263785914018 is available now to connect?
27/10/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Good afternoon ..  am available now
27/10/23, 3:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, and good afternoon to you too. May I know if you are clear so far?
27/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Yes
27/10/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great now here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Moreblessing, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Ooh okay I understand
27/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Moreblessing,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission however, you did not respond. May I know if we are still connected?
27/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Yes we can connect now
27/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now moving ahead.

*3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/10/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Ohh I understand
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Oky that's good
27/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/10/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Provide with more information
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/10/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement. <This message was edited>
27/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Can we reconnect tomorrow am a little busy nw
27/10/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry but tomorrow we will not be available since it is the weekend, the discussion now will not take long if you are actively present, it will hardly take your 10 minutes.
27/10/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Oky I understand
27/10/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Yes
27/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Okay Ms Kirti I agree
27/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 591 4018: I also have a question on that too
27/10/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please?
27/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 591 4018: What are conditions necessary for Moreblessing to be qualified for 100% scholarship as it's part of family's wish too
27/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
27/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 591 4018: What are those criteria's Ms Kirti
27/10/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As I mentioned above Moreblessing should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, a 14, or 15 points in A- level will stand him out qualifying for a higher quantum of scholarship.
27/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Okay thanks
27/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/10/23, 10:15 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Yes l am
27/10/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
27/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Oooh yes
27/10/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
27/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 591 4018: It's fine Ms Kirti
27/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 591 4018: I understand
27/10/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
30/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Yes
30/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As Moreblessing's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Moreblessing is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
30/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Ooh yes am too excited I really want the best for him
30/10/23, 2:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
30/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 591 4018: It's fine thank you Ms Kirti
14/11/23, 7:32 am - +263 78 284 6426: Good day
14/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you wish to share any thoughts of concerns?
14/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 284 6426: I don't have anything M's Kirti
14/11/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Have a great day ahead.
14/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Thank you
14/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
14/11/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Moreblessing,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 05:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 05:30 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

14/11/23, 10:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

14/11/23, 11:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please have a great night to you too.
14/11/23, 11:24 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Thank you
14/11/23, 11:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
15/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Good day Ms Kirti
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Moreblessing,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 591 4018: How are those cost allocated Ms Kirti
15/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 591 4018: Yes Ms Kirti
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 591 4018: 1. $900
2. 3years
3. $300
4. $750
15/11/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 11:24 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yeah I understood
15/11/23, 11:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, however, since our available hours for today are over we will be reconnecting with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm I hope you will be available to connect with us without any delays.
16/11/23, 12:19 am - +263 78 284 6426: Okay
16/11/23, 12:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes M's Kirti
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, we can connect now, so may I know if you are clear here
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes sure
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 1:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 284 6426: It really does M's Kirti I can see that it clarifies all
16/11/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently and let us reconnect tomorrow at 12:30 pm.
16/11/23, 11:03 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay Ms Kirti
17/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay M's Kirti
17/11/23, 2:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
17/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes I'm clear on that one
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
17/11/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Ooooh wow that's great news
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Oooooh
17/11/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
17/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yeah sure
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 5:52 am - +263 78 284 6426: Yes sure I can understand M's Kirti
18/11/23, 8:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Moreblessing,

I trust this message finds you in good health. By the time you responded it was past our available hours and since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that I will be able to help you with your queries and discuss the letter in detail?
18/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 78 284 6426: Yes M's Kirti
18/11/23, 8:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
18/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 284 6426: Yeah I'm clear M's Kirti
18/11/23, 8:39 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 8:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 284 6426: No in Kwekwe Midlands province
18/11/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/11/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/11/23, 8:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 284 6426: Thats okay M's Kirti thank you
18/11/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
18/11/23, 9:00 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi InnBucks for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 78 284 6426: Yes sure
18/11/23, 9:04 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here are the *Mukuru account details*

Shorwi Kawadza

Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738

Identity Number: 42-080703T-42
Passport Number: EN404794
18/11/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 284 6426: Thank you M's Kirti
18/11/23, 9:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
18/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 284 6426: Thank you so much
18/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 284 6426: Is there other university besides of this Galgotias University
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Yes, please I will get back to your query and I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
18/11/23, 9:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
18/11/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 284 6426: Yes I understand M's Kirti
18/11/23, 9:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 9:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 9:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 284 6426: Yes M's Kirti
18/11/23, 9:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now coming back to your concern. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
18/11/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
18/11/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
18/11/23, 9:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 284 6426: Yes I am clear now
18/11/23, 9:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
18/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 284 6426: No I'm not
18/11/23, 9:35 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
18/11/23, 9:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
18/11/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 284 6426: Okay M's Kirti its understood
18/11/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 284 6426: No M's Kirti
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
18/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).

Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

23/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Okay thank you
23/11/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
23/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 284 6426: It would be most suitable for me to pay 300 coz for now due to Zimbabwe economical issues it is very hard to comprise such amount but I'll try
24/11/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Moreblessing.

I hope you are doing well and this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
24/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes sure M's Kirti
24/11/23, 2:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to connect with you today. Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?

24/11/23, 4:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand what you are trying to say over the personal window, and you have informed me about your challenges within time, so I am here to assist you always, and sometimes even a 45 day time period is not enough and I do acknowledge that for that, In order to assist you here, I would like to understand how much have you been able to raise so far, and how much will you be able to raise by the 28th of November?

27/11/23, 11:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, so l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication since the university closes the round of applications on the 31st of this month and I will not be able to assist you after that? <This message was edited>

I trust you are in good health. I've been eagerly anticipating your response to my previous message. However, I understand that you may not have had the opportunity to reply just yet. If convenient for you, could you kindly confirm whether our communication is still ongoing? Your confirmation would be appreciated.

I was unable to connect with you when you reached out as it was past our available hours. However, I am now active and ready for our session to be productive and obtain a better understanding. Hence, may I know if you are available now to proceed with the session?
04/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 284 6426: Yes sure
04/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263782846426 Greetings. I must admit I feel a bit disappointed because I have been waiting for responses for more than a week. I understand that raising the amount all at once can be a challenge, however, if you had been active I would have assisted you better. What I would like to understand first is the reason for your being inactive despite our best efforts to connect with you even over the personal window, may I know what happened all of a sudden?
04/12/23, 10:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. As my available hours for today are over I hope you will be available tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm. Looking forward to connecting with you have a great evening ahead.
