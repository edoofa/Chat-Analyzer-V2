09/10/23, 3:37 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Sent folder?
16/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon!

I hope you have a restful weekend with your family. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 3:02 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm not ready ...lm writing exams this week so my schedule is so tight
17/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for informing me. Exams are indeed a priority, and your focus should be on them. In the mean time, may I know if your parents are available with us to continue with the session?
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - +27 64 208 8655: They are not
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Very well, may I know by when you think they might be available for the session?
17/10/23, 3:23 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I think next week
17/10/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Are they facing any challenges?
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - +27 64 208 8655: No
17/10/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So may I know why we would be expecting the session from next week, dear?
17/10/23, 3:33 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Can you continue with them in my absentee?
17/10/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, as this is a family discussion, we could also proceed with your parents as well.
17/10/23, 3:36 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Okay okay
17/10/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So may I know why we would be expecting the session from next week, dear?
17/10/23, 3:43 pm - +27 64 208 8655: So you can continue with them
17/10/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well then, I shall be expecting our session. Have a great day, dear.
25/10/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 4:30 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Ok can a student get a scholarship more than 50%
25/10/23, 4:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes indeed you can, I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
25/10/23, 5:02 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes clear
25/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 5:06 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm not understanding here
25/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 5:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 5:08 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes yes
25/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
25/10/23, 5:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 5:10 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes
25/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 5:13 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Costs on Admission process and higher education
25/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The details will be thoroughly explained to you in the offer letter shared with you by the universities. For an assumption of the costs, please refer to the message below.
25/10/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since you are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)

The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
25/10/23, 5:20 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Clear
25/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Rachel's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Rachel is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
25/10/23, 5:31 pm - +27 64 208 8655: As for now my guardian is not online
25/10/23, 5:31 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes
25/10/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Rachel's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
25/10/23, 5:36 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Noted thank you
25/10/23, 5:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
25/10/23, 5:57 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Thank you .. have a nice day too ahead

18/11/23, 10:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
18/11/23, 10:49 am - +27 64 208 8655: Noted

2.$0
3.$1600
4.$125+$125
5.$1000
18/11/23, 10:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
18/11/23, 10:56 am - +27 64 208 8655: Yes following
18/11/23, 10:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
18/11/23, 10:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1350(tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1600.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1350. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you? <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 11:00 am - +27 64 208 8655: So first year will pay $1600 and then onwards $1250 ?
18/11/23, 11:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: There was a little error in the above data. From the following year you will be able to pay $1350! Please let me know if you are clear here.
18/11/23, 11:04 am - +27 64 208 8655: Yes
18/11/23, 11:04 am - +27 64 208 8655: Following

18/11/23, 11:11 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes you will be. Now, If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your  per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

4. Examination Fee

18/11/23, 11:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 11:14 am - +27 64 208 8655: This is covered by which cost ?
18/11/23, 11:14 am - +27 64 208 8655: What about food?
18/11/23, 11:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with the food here. The university will provide you with the opportunity to cook your own food at your accommodation, which means you have the liberty to eat your home-cooked meals. It will cost the students a monthly expense of $40 to $50 to gather groceries or even sometimes order food from outside the university, giving you affordability and convenience too. I hope I am clear on this?
18/11/23, 11:17 am - +27 64 208 8655: Yes clear
18/11/23, 11:18 am - +27 64 208 8655: Following
18/11/23, 11:33 am - +27 64 208 8655: Hello
18/11/23, 11:35 am - +27 64 208 8655: I have other questions
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Please do ask .
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm not understanding on that 15 days mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 12:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is aright, I am coming to the deadlines for your clarification very shortly so with that said. Shall we proceed with the session?
18/11/23, 12:02 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes
18/11/23, 12:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1350, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 12:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 12:04 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes clear ... following
18/11/23, 12:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 12:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1350. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1350 - $1000 = $350, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 12:50 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes following
18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.
18/11/23, 12:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1600 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
18/11/23, 1:00 pm - +27 64 208 8655: So I will pay $1600 plus $1000 for the first year?
18/11/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, it is not it will be adjusted meaning only you will be paying $1600. Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well. 

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon a little early as it is the weekend here. So, let us connect on Monday from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great weekend with tons of Fun, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
18/11/23, 1:07 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Thank you ..same to you
20/11/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 5:54 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Hello afternoon Sir
20/11/23, 5:54 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm sorry ..l didn't manage to reach you today
20/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
20/11/23, 8:01 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes lm ready ...lm facing network problem
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm not getting you
20/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
20/11/23, 8:06 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes understood
20/11/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As per the cost of education that was offered, it ranged from $2,000 to $3,000. Do you recall?
20/11/23, 8:07 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Offered to me or?
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. May I know if you are recalling your counseling sessions?
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes
20/11/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to heart that. When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
20/11/23, 8:31 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes following
20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education.
20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
20/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
20/11/23, 8:36 pm - +27 64 208 8655: To save at least $850
20/11/23, 8:36 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I agree
20/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1850 - $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 9:05 pm - +27 64 208 8655: So it changed from $1600 you mentioned on our last discussion?
20/11/23, 9:08 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Thanks Sir ...my network is poor these days
20/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 9:14 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Clear
20/11/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today.

However, As much as I would like to proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
20/11/23, 9:22 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Noted Sir thank you
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
21/11/23, 3:42 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Im ready
21/11/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 1st, 2023*.
21/11/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
21/11/23, 6:04 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes explain
21/11/23, 6:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *December 1st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of  *January 1st, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/11/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before December 1st, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/11/23, 6:15 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Clear
21/11/23, 6:15 pm - +27 64 208 8655: But it will be difficult
21/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be helping you with that soon. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 7:05 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm in Beitbridge
21/11/23, 7:05 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I mean will be difficult to pay in those mentioned days
21/11/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We shall discuss the same once we complete the offer letter, and I have taken note of your concern very seriously now.
21/11/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Thank you
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Thank you
21/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 7:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s Mukuru for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/11/23, 7:13 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes
21/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

21/11/23, 7:21 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes thank you
21/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 7:30 pm - +27 64 208 8655: The due date of payment
21/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, could you provide me with the exact challenges that you are facing so that I can expedite this process for you?
21/11/23, 7:49 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I can't make it to cover all registration fee during this period of due date
21/11/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainl you are not advised to cover all of them hence it is provdd to you with the initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *December 1st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).
21/11/23, 8:42 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Okay noted
21/11/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -

21/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that , before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.

This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Thursday at 7:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
21/11/23, 9:11 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes sounds good
21/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, let us connect at the said timeframe!
21/11/23, 9:13 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Noted
21/11/23, 9:14 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Amazing
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Rachel!

I hope you are having a fine afternoon. Our DSW (Department of Student Welfare) Team recently had a trip to MVN University this week. During their visit, they had a good time interacting with the students and managed to capture glimpses of your senior colleagues who have enrolled at MVN University this year for the 2023 intake. I wanted to share this information with you to let you know that they had a great time with the DSW team.

In case you're curious about the person in the photo from our team, that is Mr. Mukund. He will be one of the individuals greeting you upon your arrival in India.
23/11/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 5:19 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Afternoon how are you
23/11/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, dear. How are you and your family doing today?
23/11/23, 7:37 pm - +27 64 208 8655: We are doing well thanks for asking
23/11/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by MVN University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from MVN University as a collective?
23/11/23, 8:10 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes yes
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
23/11/23, 8:15 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Regarding our discussion ...they were so happy but they have a  quiry on the due date of payment
23/11/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please share it with me.
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - +27 64 208 8655: They said it will be difficult to pay the amount within the duration of payment
23/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 8:24 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Suggestions?
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's great to hear your family is enthusiastic about the opportunity! Regarding the payment query, I'm here to help. Do you have specific concerns about the payment duration or any challenges that might affect meeting the payment deadline?
23/11/23, 8:37 pm - +27 64 208 8655: They are saying their budget towards this festive season will not be enough to meet the payment deadline
23/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. Ideally, a student needs to make the payment of the university registration fee by the mentioned deadline as the seats are reserved for you and there are limited seats for this scholarship opportunity. I understand that you are facing financial challenges at the moment, and as your admission officer, I'll do my best to assist you with this.

Therefore, please allow me until tomorrow to provide you with an update on your request. I'll have a detailed discussion with the academic board and get back to you with an answer. Please let me know if you agree to this?
23/11/23, 9:01 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I agree thank you Sir
23/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that let us connect tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 PM.
23/11/23, 9:09 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Noted
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Rachel!

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I'm doing well
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - +27 64 208 8655: How are you
24/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear you're doing well, and I'm doing well too, thank you for asking. I recently had a conversation with the academic board and wanted to assist you better in achieving our goals here. So, I would appreciate it if you could address the challenges you are currently facing in deep details. This would give me a deeper understanding and enable me to provide better assistance today for you. Could you let me know if you'd be able to do that?
24/11/23, 12:42 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yes lm able
24/11/23, 12:42 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Can l use an audio
24/11/23, 12:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes you can do that as well, please
24/11/23, 12:48 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Hello afternoon .let me address our challenge as a family concerning the opportunity we got from MVN ..it's a great pleasure as a family and we are glad to have this opportunity but on the issue of deadline of payment ...my family is saying they can't afford to meet the deadline towards this festive season
24/11/23, 12:49 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Their budget is not sufficient to meet the deadline
24/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's wonderful that you've shared your concerns with me, and I genuinely appreciate that. As we approach the end of this year, we are gearing up for holidays and family time during these festive days. I understand that this festive season is often associated with increased financial demands, including expenses for celebrations, gifts, and various festivities. Families typically plan and allocate budgets for these activities well in advance. However, unforeseen opportunities, like this one from MVN University, can sometimes create unexpected financial challenges, especially when they coincide with the festive season.
24/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While I recognize that this can add financial burdens, I'm confident you understand that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. This offer provides you with a 90% scholarship on your tuition fees and 100% on the accommodation fees, meaning you would be living free of cost at the prestigious MVN University, a privilege that many international students struggle to attain. Despite the financial challenges, I believe this is something you take pride in, and you're determined not to miss out on this opportunity. Securing such a substantial scholarship makes you one of the fortunate students, and I hope you resonate with my perspective?
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Yesyes
24/11/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that and as your admission officer, I'm here to assist you. However, as the scholarship opportunities are also limited and many international students are applying as this is a rare case for you with this amount of quantum the opportunity might be given to another student sharing the same academic goal with you. Nevertheless, I'd like to inquire about the amount you can gather before the first deadline of 1st December. If you could provide me with this information, it would help me assure the university officials that you're committed to payment and help you retain this offer letter. Can you please share these details with me?
24/11/23, 4:34 pm - +27 64 208 8655: I will inform my family in the evening and come back to you
24/11/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. Could please let me know by when you might be able to provide me with an update?
24/11/23, 4:36 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Tomorrow
25/11/23, 7:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good morning dear parents and Rachel!

Let's work together on this to ensure everything aligns with the deadline. With that said, could you please let me know by when you might be able to providee me with the update?

27/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and have a meaningful converation. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

28/11/23, 3:22 pm - +27 64 208 8655: Hello ...they are asking if you are able to extent dates
28/11/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges?

As you can also see that you're entitled with 90% scholarship and free accommodation which is a life time opportunity and it come very rarely. Waiting that long will lead to losing out on your  seat. As the university will eventually act fair will all the students and hence they will provide this opportunity to other students. May I know if you are getting my point here please?

You've been offered a remarkable opportunity with a 90% scholarship and free accommodation, which is exceedingly rare, and a lifetime chance. Delaying might result in losing your seat, as the university aims to treat all students fairly, offering this opportunity to others eventually. Please let me know if you are clear here?
