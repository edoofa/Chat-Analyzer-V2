This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

Thank you for the kind words and all your support during the admission process

22/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!.

I hope you're having a fine evening today. I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer starting today. I would like to inform you that I will be taking over your session for the admission process, as Mr. Milan has been assigned to a new role as informed to you. I am pleased to let you know that he will be there upon your arrival in India to guide you through the university and you will be meeting him in person.

In the meantime, please take a look at the insights provided to you. Have a great night and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
22/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.

23/11/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Yes that's right
23/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, based on our experience of over 14 years and after helping over 5000 students from different countries, what we have realized is financial planning is the most important factor when we think about higher education abroad. And to help the students and parents with that, the Edoofa Management has come up with a financially secure plan that will help you plan for your child’s higher education without stress and last-minute rush.
23/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Over the last 7 years, we have seen that 20-30% of students who take admission are unable to come to India because of lack of financial planning. The money required to book flights, and pay for accommodation and food after arrival is something that takes a toll and they are unable to send the child in that year and decide to defer the admission which creates a gap in education for the child. So, the Edoofa Secure Plan will reduce the financial pressure and smoothen the journey of sending your child to India.
23/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are in the month of November 2023 now and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for the finances. As you have been informed during the counseling session that we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees, the cost of education including the food, accommodation would be between $2000-$3000 and can even be less as well but not more, which means if you are able to save $150 per month for the next 20 months you will be able to save $3000 which is more than enough for the first year university fee which includes tuition fees (if any), food and accommodation.
23/11/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That means by the time your child will be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first year fee. Now, in these 20 months, I am sure the child will also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if the child secures to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years is already secured. Now, for a 3 year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 year, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent is easy and smooth. Do you agree to this?
23/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Understood sir but on accomodation, will I be staying on school campus or?
23/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Thank you for the information on the savings plan. I'm just wondering, what would be the best way for my dad to save the money. What do you recommend?
23/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will have to decide on that, dear.
23/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For now let us focus on the EWYL savings only, dear.
23/11/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 992 7576: It's okay sir
23/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Can you please explain what I will be doing, when I  will be starting etc
23/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 463 0352: Interesting news, l totaly agree with you, the EWYL program will definately help finantialy, it will reduce the burden on me as a parent.
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am coming to that too.
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, also, there is another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different. Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, mugging everyday. And in that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank requires a Nostro Account which means you have to pay to the bank to keep your money safe, right?
23/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 463 0352: Very true. Money is always safe in the bank despite the cost of bank charges.
23/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 2:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Goodnight sir thank you
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Good day sir
25/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I'd like to reschedule our missed session for Monday at 5:30 PM. If the timing poses any challenges, please feel free to reach out to me. Have a wonderful week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family.
25/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 463 0352: Good day Sir, noted with many thanks, pleasant weekend to you too.
25/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Okay sir, thank you
27/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Good afternoon to you as well!

I'm doing quite well and definitely shaking off those Monday blues.Thank you for asking and how are you today?
27/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 463 0352: Good afternoon Sir, we doing great thank you.
27/11/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Yes we are ready sir.
27/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 463 0352: Yes Sir
27/11/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, the Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save the money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Let me explain how:

Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months. Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
27/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Yes sir
27/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 463 0352: That is good news, now l would like to ask, if it happens that the student does not make it to India due to, for example, sickness, failling final exam on academics, natural disasters etc, is that money refundable?
27/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that's a valid concern. In the unfortunate event that the student cannot make it to India due to unforeseen circumstances such as sickness, academic challenges, or natural disasters, rest assured that the amount of the fee, after adjusting for the university registration fee, will be refunded to the parent. We understand the importance of addressing various scenarios, and rest assured, that as promised early on, the Edoofa will be here to assist with solutions for any challenges that may arise during the procedures to ensure that you are able to pursue your education aborad and fulfill your dream of education abroad. Rest assured that as we move forward with our discussion, we would be helping you with such queries and ensure that you have all the clarity you need.
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 78 992 7576: Good afternoon Mr Jivsheet, Sorry for late response
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 992 7576: My dad is caught up with work, he will reply as soon as he get spare time
29/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 463 0352: Good afternoon Sir, apologies for the late response, been tied up with a bit of work out of town.
29/11/23, 12:24 pm - +263 77 463 0352: Would you kindly give us up to tomorrow to so we sit down and discuss about this payment plan as a family? Will get back to you.
29/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
