26/10/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for this confirmation! Moving forward, I would like to bring an important aspect to your attention. The collective aim that we have for the student strongly values balanced involvement from parents, especially when the student is unable to participate. Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you or your guardians won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand so that we can plan and schedule our discussion beforehand. I hope you have taken note of this as well?
26/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Very well
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Fantastic! Now over the next four days, our focus as your admission team will be on equipping you with a comprehensive understanding of what lies ahead in your university admission journey and help you commence the same.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Soon after, we will guide you through the initiation of your EWYL Journey. The next batch of EWYL Sessions is scheduled to commence on Friday (03rd November ) and hence, if we are able to focus and complete the Admission Process before Friday with pure consistency, you will be able to start your EWYL journey as well in a timely manner.
26/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
26/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:

This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Rutendo EWYL23E0845)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present.

I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
26/10/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
26/10/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end.

I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?

Our commitment to equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed for success in today's world is a core part of our mission.

To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed.

26/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes you may

Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for filling out these forms from your perspective? <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I hope by Monday
26/10/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect on Monday at 2:30 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed night and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
26/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Thank you
30/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Good evening sir.Sorry wasn't available at 2pm but am now available
30/10/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, I am happy to hear that you are now available. May I know if you were able to fill out the above forms?
30/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes I did but am trying scanning so as to forward to you.The first one hasn't got Rutendos photo can I send it separately
30/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I received that message for the second form
30/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed you can do that as well.
30/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noticed that you have mentioned November 18th as the EWYL orientation session availability date. However, as we have discussed above, it is scheduled to be held on November 3rd. May I know if you are experiencing any confusion here?
30/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 391 8367: It's because the applicant will only be available after she has finished exams
30/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I can understand that Rutendo is currently in her exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect her exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, she can enhance her study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit her performance in the upcoming exams.
30/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and her exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
30/10/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if Rutendo is occupied with exams, you on her behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
30/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 391 8367: She does not have a gadget  at school...she is not allowed as per school rules so she won't benefit anyhow
30/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I saw its written that the days should not be more than 3 days apart that's why I had to put the dates
30/10/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that. As stated above, may I know if you might be able to attend the orientation session on Rutendo's behalf?
30/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I guess so
30/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In that case, I would like to correct the orientation availability date as the 3rd of November, and please do share it with me again.
30/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Will share tomorrow.My phone isn't working well so had to ask someone to scan it for me.
30/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, in the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
30/10/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
30/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
31/10/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
31/10/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
31/10/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
31/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes,what happens then
31/10/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that fortunate event, we will guide you through the best offer letter based on your preference.
31/10/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok,that will be great
31/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
31/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
31/10/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
31/10/23, 7:33 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Correct
31/10/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
31/10/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes we are
31/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
31/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
31/10/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
31/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I have
31/10/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today. I will be closing our session for now as I have an upcoming meeting to attend. I would like to also inform you that I will not be available tomorrow to proceed with the session as I will be on leave for my birthday. So, let's reschedule the session for the next day, which is Thursday, starting from 2:00 PM onwards. I will also be available in the evening at 5:00 PM as well.
31/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 391 8367: That's ok
31/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Thank you
01/11/23, 12:06 am - +263 77 391 8367: Happy birthday
02/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear Parents and Rutendo.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed. Thank you so much.

I'm now active and ready to take on your session. I would also like to inform you that I will be available in the evening as well, from 5:00 PM, in case you are currently occupied. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.

02/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please share a picture of this document. I am failing to open it from my end.
02/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents with me. Since we have all the documents shall we now proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
02/11/23, 3:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
02/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 391 8367: I understand
02/11/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
02/11/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
02/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Sorry take me back,do we get the acceptance letter before the results
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, you do not receive a letter from the university first. The admission letter from the university comes after you have accepted the offer. May I know if you are clear here?
02/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: @263773918367 May I know if we are still connected so that we can proceed further with the session and hopefully wrap up our session for today?
02/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 391 8367: My network is on and off
02/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
02/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
02/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
02/11/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Does the offer letter come without us filling all the requirements
02/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 391 8367: We haven't submitted this form
02/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed, what you are saying is correct. The offer letter will arrive as a conditional offer letter, and it can, at any time, change its scholarship percentage with the Statement of Purpose (SOP) and the arrival of the A-level results.
02/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
02/11/23, 5:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
02/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes please
02/11/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
02/11/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
02/11/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
02/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: We can continue
02/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
02/11/23, 5:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
02/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
02/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
02/11/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 5:57 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
02/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 391 8367: It does
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
02/11/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
02/11/23, 6:04 pm - +263 77 391 8367: No
02/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
02/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Shed more light
02/11/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
02/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
02/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 391 8367: So if the student gets 2 A levels she gets 50% scholarship and if she gets more points her scholarship will be reviewed
02/11/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options if the result sis unsuccessful, do you agree with these?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
02/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 7:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
02/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
02/11/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
02/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
02/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
02/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Whilst pursuing a diploma will you still be under Edoofa
02/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed, you will still be under the EDOOFA program even if you proceed with the Diploma course.
02/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
02/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
02/11/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/11/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 391 8367: Then, As per our Academic Board terms, you are required to draft a mail on behalf of Rutendo to me stating that:

Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because  _  from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Jasmine as soon as I get over with my school.

04/11/23, 11:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the update. I understand that the session was paused due to the absence of Rutendo. That's perfectly fine, and I appreciate you attending the initial orientation. When Rutendo is available, you can continue with the session as scheduled by Ms. Jasmine.
04/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 391 8367: Ok thank you
04/11/23, 12:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Rutendo's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Rutendo is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
04/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Definitely
04/11/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Rutendo's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

04/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, we can wait until Monday for your visit and Rutendo's input.

27/11/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 956 9902: Thank you
28/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from PDM University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
28/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 391 8367: 1. $1315
2. 3 Years
3. $750
28/11/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, You are absolutely correct. Let me provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from PDM University. Following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1315, and your annual accommodation fee amounts to $1250. This results in the per annum cost of education being $2565. I hope this provides you with a clear understanding of the financial aspects of your education?
28/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok,yes
28/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Does your scholarship cover part of accommodation fees or its just tuition
28/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The scholarships offered only extend to covering tuition fees only, leaving other expenses. However, at Edoofa, we go the extra mile to ensure that the financial relief we offer spans beyond mere tuition coverage. When we quote a range of $2000 to $3000 in support, it's not solely designated for tuition; it's inclusive of all other vital aspects of your education journey.

This support is intended to not only cover your tuition expenses but also cater to your accommodation and nourishment needs, ensuring a comprehensive support system for your educational pursuits. I hope I am clear on this?
28/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Okay
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you following through. Regarding accommodation at PDM University, it is recommended that for the first year, students opt for on-campus hostels since they are new to the area and the university can better assist them with their Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) requirements.
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: From the second year onward, when they are more familiar with the place and have made friends, if they wish, they have the option to move out of on-campus accommodation and explore the off-campus options.
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, her accommodation fee would be reduced to $1000 per annum, paid directly to the landlord. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70, and the cost of food would be $20 to $30.
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the off-campus accommodation, hence the reduced per annum cost would be $2315 ($1315 tuition fee + $1000 off-campus accommodation). I trust this provides you with clarity on the accommodation options?
28/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Will that not create some transport fees if she goes off campus..will it be a walking distance to school
28/11/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. Also, in terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as it is very near to the university. It will be either walking distance or local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 every month.

Coming to more about safety, the accommodations are equipped with 24-hour CCTV surveillance and a guard, and Rutendo will be living with her local friends as a community, which gives her pride and strength. Please let me know if you are clear here as well.
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
28/11/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at PDM University, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 391 8367: These are paid for by whom
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: These are included in your per annum cost of education and they are not required to be paid as extra. Now that we have established Rutendo's total annual education cost as $2315, let me also guide you on how we can make her education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
28/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
28/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see you together with the discussion. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that Yemurai with her hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
28/11/23, 4:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, she can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his annual fee, which is $2315. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2315 - $1000 = $1315, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
28/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 391 8367: It will be good. It reduces my financial burden
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Alright, With this, let us now shift our attention to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter. As previously explained, the registration fee of $750 is not an extra cost, it is included in her first-year educational expenses. Therefore, the amount of the fee you will need to pay once she arrives in India will be as follows:

1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, this means you only need to pay the tuition fee to the university. Therefore, the fee balance becomes $1315 - $750 = $565, and this must be paid in one part within three days of your arrival in India.
28/11/23, 6:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Consequently, If you opt for *On-campus accommodation*, the tuition fee of $1315 and the accommodation fee of $1250 will be required. This totals $2565. After deducting the registration fee, the remaining balance will be $2565 - $750 = $1815. This amount can be paid in two installments of $907 and $908, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
28/11/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes it does
28/11/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that, and you're free to go with the second option as per your preference. As outlined in the offer letter, it's required for a student to submit a registration fee of $750 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the deadline date as December 12, 2023.
28/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok
28/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In connection to our prior conversation and the benefits extended through the Endowment plan, you may remember the entitlement to a $150 grant applicable toward the registration fee. Also, there's a flexible payment plan available to ease the fee payment. Would you want me to explain its workings?
28/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Please explain
28/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on Yemurai's behalf, and as a parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of December 12th, 2023 (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of January 12th, 2024 (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Yemurai's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 12th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Pardon me , is this for Rutendo or yemurai?
28/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me for the error here. It is for Rutendo. The reason why there was an error was I shared the same details that form one of my students and I missed to change the name here. However the content of the fees and the deadline is the same as Rutendo. Could you please let me know if you are clear here ?
28/11/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Good night
29/11/23, 4:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening parent and my dear student!

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
29/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Good evening sir.How  are you?
29/11/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
29/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
29/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
29/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
29/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
29/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 77 956 9902: Good evening
29/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
29/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
29/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
29/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Do we get a  receipt for the payment
29/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Indeed,  Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
29/11/23, 7:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
29/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Yes
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
29/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 391 8367: We will see
29/11/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
29/11/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
30/11/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Rutendo!

30/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let me share a few insights into the PDM University with you -

PDM University, short for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University, is a prominent institution located in Delhi, India. It has a remarkable history, having initially operated as an institution before attaining university status in 2016.
30/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Situated in the bustling metropolis of Delhi, PDM University boasts the advantage of easy access to the city's efficient metro rail system. This achievement signifies the university's significant growth over a mere five years. Its success has been so substantial that it played a pivotal role in the government's decision to construct a metro station, further enhancing the accessibility of the institution to the entire city through the metro rail network.

30/11/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
30/11/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.

We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
30/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok,thank you. Chat again on Monday. Have a good weekend
04/12/23, 1:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rutendo!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by PDM University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from PDM University as a collective?
04/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 391 8367: How are you.we are all ok thank you
04/12/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 391 8367: We googled about the university and we found out that it rated number 776 in India. Are there universities that are highly ranked that's associated with edoofa ?
04/12/23, 2:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that you have done you research about the university. University rankings varies in terms of websites and you can also find that the ranking changes as well. So in order to lead you better here may I know where did you get this information with, please?
04/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 391 8367: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I completely understand the importance of choosing the right university for your son's education, and I appreciate the effort you have put into researching PDM University.

Your commitment to ensuring a good university for your son is commendable. Hence, I would like to address your concerns and offer some guidance. I am sure you must be aware that there are different ranking bodies in India and when you research university rankings and reviews, it's crucial to consider reliable sources such as official university websites, reputable education portals, and recognized ranking platforms.
04/12/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While online reviews provide insights, they might not always represent the complete picture. University rankings can vary based on the criteria considered, and some universities might excel in specific departments or programs.

To provide you with accurate information, PDM University is one of the leading universities in the Delhi NCR, which is the capital of India, and was recommended for your daughter after careful consideration. Hence, I am not sure about the places you have looked for, but if I am correct, it seems as if you were exploring the wrong place, and thus these concerns were highlighted.
04/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok,
04/12/23, 2:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Could you please let me know if you any more concerns that you would like to share, please?
04/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 956 9902: No that was helpful; thank you
04/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
04/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Valerie.vcf (file attached)
04/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
04/12/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
04/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Ok,will try contacting them
04/12/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 12, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
04/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 391 8367: We are still discussing about the way forward
04/12/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Making this payment means you have obtained this seat and the other universities as well and you do not have to pay for future offer letters if the registration fee is the same, as you are an Edoofian and we can adjust the amount to the next university of your choice. hence May I know if you are facing any challenges?
04/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 391 8367: Not yet
04/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In that case, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
04/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 391 8367: The dad has the final say
04/12/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, may I know by when your father will be able to give us an reply?
