*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
07/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
07/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
07/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
07/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

08/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 445 1889: OK.Sir i was not around i was not available
08/11/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for the day now. I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and wi be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the *"Festival of Lights."* It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

13/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Question 2 ( explain the mechanism  cavitation in pipes and drains)

Cavitation referes to the formation of air bubbles in fluid in a low pressure condition which is lower than the saturation pressure.It is a potentially damaging condition in which the fluid in pipes or sewers is at high velocities.It also occurs when the hydrodynamic pressure exceeds the vapour pressure of a moving fluid.By Bernoullis equation,at high flow velocities ,the pressure head of fluid is reduced accordingly.As the fluid pressure is less than saturation pressure ,dissolved gases are released from the fluid and these air bubbles will suddenly collapse when the flow enters into a region of,a high pressure or gas bubbles from with in the liquid ,which becomes a two Phase system ,the bubbles will be crushed against the pipes surface at high speed ,an attack that leads to cavities with round tours .This produces a high dynamic pressure which causes damage to pipeline due to high frequency.

Question 3 (Explain the meaning of soil reinforcement and why it is important and state with example the main cause of a building collapse)

It is a methode that is used to increase the bearing capacity and strength of the soil.Different ground improvement techniques are used to enhance soil strength like vibro replacement stone and sand columns ,by providing root pipes soil nailing,strips and membranes ,stone columns and granular blankets.After improvement the soil can withstand large tensile strength.

Importances of soil reinforcement
- it increases the bearing capacity and strength of soil ,which can eliminate the need for expensive foundations 
- increase the resistant to differential settlements 
- the approach uses layers of geogrid to reinforce soil,increasing bearing capacity
-reinforcement soil structures  have lowee bearing pressure
-it creates strong ,durable structures requiring minimum maintainance

Causes of building collapse
Building collapse refers to the failure of the structure or componant due to poor designs ,poor construction methodes and also environmental condituons.

Main cause of building collapse is due to poor foundations 
Bearing capacity is the majour effect with determines the size of foundation to be made.If the soil is weak the foundation footing must be large to spread out the load and if the soil is strongee the foundation footing will be small since it can with stand the load  

Question 4 (Explain MIVAN construction methode and its usage in building construction today)

Its is a completly modern methode that is best suited for the construction of large scale structures especially when repetitive slabs and blocks are involved.This structural system is very popullar for low cost housing in large cities and it also reflects novel and advanced construction techniques.

Implementation process
- setting up the wall reinforcing steel
- placement of alluminium formwork 
- pouring concrate
It has high tolerance and requires no further plastering ,saving time and money.

Advantages of MIVAN construction methode
- avoid wastage of workmanship
-wide range of resources can be saved such as material and machinary
- normally light weighted aluminium is used and formwork that can be easily assembled by saving time ,workfoce and cost
-shattering provides a better finish for the building
-lesser number of construction joints hence reducing leakages  and increasing durability of the structure
- less number of joints also reduces the number of dowels needed and sometime allows to reduce the weakness introduced in structural mumbers due to joints

Disadvantage of MIVAN 
-demands uniform planning
-construction cracks can develope
-comparatively expensive

Componants of MIVAN constuction methode 

-Wall componant
-Beam componant 
Deek componant

question 5 ( explain pre fabricated structures and its usage in large infrastructure projects )

These are structures that are manufactured off site in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly.The componants of these structures such as walls,floors,roofs are typically made from materials like steel ,wood or concrate.Once they are deliverd to the site ,they are assembled to form the final structure.On the other hand ,they are constructed on -site using pre -manufactured componants.These componants are produced off- site and transported to the building site were they are assembled to form the building structure .Offsite manufactured pre - fabricated building system are built in three main types of construction which are;
(1) modular construction - manufacturing of fully self contained units in an offsite facility to be transported to site to ne assembled to form complete structure
(2)Panelised construction - manufacturing of flat panel units in an offsite facility to be transported to site to be assembled to form a complete structure.
- enables the construction process to mon

(3)hybrid prefab construction - combining both panelised and modula method.Compact modular units are used for the highly serviced and more repeatable areas such as kitchens  
 
Advantages of of pre fabricated structures 
- reduced need for labour,especially for skilled trades such as welding 
- enables the construction process to move away from being labour orianted operation 
- it also allows construction projects to archieve reduced on site congestion ,waste and pollution .
- allows construction to commence earlier 
- it reduces construction time
-it is not easily affected by weather conditions 

Types of modules used in construction 
-Load bearring modula structural system
- corner supported mkdula structural system

16/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Afternoon sir
16/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes how are you
16/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 445 1889: You are welcome sir
16/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 445 1889: I have sent the document
16/11/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 445 1889: It is correct sir
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes
16/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
16/11/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
16/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
16/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
16/11/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 445 1889: YES
16/11/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
16/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
16/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
16/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes understood
16/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes
16/11/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
16/11/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
16/11/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
16/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes
16/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
16/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800  - $1000 = $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
16/11/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Noted
16/11/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
16/11/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/11/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/11/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 445 1889: No sir noted
16/11/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/11/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
16/11/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/11/23, 7:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.

17/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes noted
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
17/11/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Noted
17/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before November 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by December 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 445 1889: No noted
17/11/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 445 1889: No sir noted
17/11/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please excuse me here you have the A level. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 445 1889: No sir well noted
17/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Sir
17/11/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
17/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 445 1889: YES sir
17/11/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
17/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

27/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 445 1889: OK sir thank yu
27/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Quest Group of Institutions* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
27/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

27/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Luckson,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 445 1889: OK...So am supposed to pay what amount
28/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad that you asked that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, and the amount of the registration fee, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
28/11/23, 2:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?

28/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Noted you can continue
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
28/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 445 1889: 1...$1 200
2.. .$750
3......$750
28/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Noted
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Hello....Sir
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1200.
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1200, the total comes out to be $1300.
28/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 445 1889: OK..So am supposed to pay what amount now
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am coming to that very soon and no you are not supposed to pay it now. Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
28/11/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1300  + $500 = $1800. I hope you are clear about this?
28/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes ..This is better sir
28/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
28/11/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes noted
28/11/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Noted
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1800 - $1000 = $800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
28/11/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
28/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes
28/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Noted
28/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Sir
28/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the registration fee of $750 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year's tuition fee, therefore the amount of tuition fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1200 - $750 = $450. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
28/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes..So now am supposed to pay $750
28/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Sir
28/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am coming to that very soon.
28/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
28/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes sir
28/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 12th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 12th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
28/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 12th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
28/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes sir
28/11/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
28/11/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
28/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 445 1889: In Kwekwe
28/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Sir
28/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
28/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
28/11/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
28/11/23, 10:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 445 1889: Mrng
29/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening parent and my dear student!

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
29/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Good and you sir
29/11/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
29/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes
29/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Coming to our previous conversation. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
29/11/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
29/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 445 1889: Yes sir
29/11/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charles is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
