Good afternoon
Hello 
Unfortunately there are preparations for Elydah. 
We are currently facing challenges as a family for Elydah to come to India and when push comes to shove 
We will have to pull out of the program and try again next year.
Thank you.

I hope you are doing well today.
08/08/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Can you also let me know about why is it that you cannot move ahead with Elydah's higher education here in India?
08/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 365 1034: Its due to financial constraints Mr Milan.
08/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 365 1034: Good afternoon to you too

I hope you are doing well today.
11/08/23, 12:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Elydah, I understand what you have said, however, for me to be able to help you in a better way, I also need to have a proper understanding about the challenges that you are facing, therefore, can you please help me understand in a better way about your concerns and challenges so that we can discuss and plan the way ahead according to that.
11/08/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 365 1034: Good afternoon Mr Milan
11/08/23, 1:19 pm - +263 77 365 1034: The challenges involve the whole family. 
I, her sister  am nolonger employed, decided to jump ship cz l was not getting any money from work. 
I'm in debt right now. 
We tried to her aunt in South Africa for hel but she had challenges she hasn't pinpointed them to us.
Our grandmother and her pension fund its not anything to save because of the fluctuating rates and the pending elections of Zimbabwe. 
Her mother hasn't paid been paid for months now. And her father is currently at home, not feeling well and since he is self employed no money is flowing.   So this has been a rollercoaster for us and it breaks my heart to say we are backing out of the program, such a beautiful and fruitful program
11/08/23, 3:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please, and I completely understand the concerns that you have shared. Now, given the current challenges that you have mentioned, I do get that it is hard for you to move ahead with the processes as planned, but at present, have you considered any alternative to choose for Elydah's higher education?
11/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 365 1034: For now nothing certain yet is in place. Once we've decided we will let you know

27/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Elydah, since the time we last connected with each other here. I wanted to ask you about your further plan to move ahead with your higher education, hence, can you please share an update with me on that?
27/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 365 1034: Mr Milan
We do not have money right now. And we are currently not doing anything for now.
We did ask for a refund and you said you cannot help
So not sure what to do wo
27/09/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, let us say that you did not get the refund, then, how is it that you are planning to proceed with Elydah's higher education?
27/09/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 365 1034: Still trying yo get the refund.
28/09/23, 10:22 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Elydah!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/09/23, 10:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Regarding this, I would like to correct myself here, I wanted to ask that let us assume if you did get the refund from our side, then in that case, how would you be moving ahead with Elydah's higher education please?
28/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 365 1034: If we get the refund
She will definitely be applying to our local Polytechnic colleges here in Zimbabwe. And probably when she finishes she will enroll again in the Edoofa program maybe for her Master's degree
28/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 365 1034: Good morning Mr Milan 
I hope you are doing well too.
Thank you
28/09/23, 1:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, may I know if you have looked about how much are the costs of pursuing a course at the local universities in Zimbabwe?
28/09/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 365 1034: They're fluctuating currently and being reviewed. So l don't have the specific amount
28/09/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is understandable. But there must be an average cost or a range of fee that you would be paying, right?
28/09/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 365 1034: Yes for Polytechnic colleges might be $300 per term or semester
28/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: This means that it would be $600 per year for just the tuition fee. What about accommodation and food, how much will it be?
28/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 365 1034: She will be coming from home.
So its not really expense
28/09/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, but there would still be the food expenses, right?
01/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 365 1034: Hello Mr Milan Singh
02/12/23, 5:49 am - +263 77 365 1034: There wouldn't be any food expenses Mr Milan Singh
02/12/23, 5:49 am - +263 77 365 1034: Now that l have responded to the last message as you told Mr Austin.
