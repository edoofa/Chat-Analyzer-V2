16/08/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 492 8058: This message was deleted
16/08/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 492 8058: Currently our exams are around the  corner so we no longer have holidays
16/08/23, 11:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, may I ask by when would you be able to finish your exams?
16/08/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 492 8058: 14 November is were my last exam is
16/08/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 492 8058: But today l am available
16/08/23, 11:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time on exams, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
16/08/23, 11:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my school.

Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
16/08/23, 12:27 pm - +48 574 536 864: Just out of curiosity, can't we squeeze the timeliness to do the sessions as and when she is available. That has been the route that we have been operating in the previous sessions. Some of the sessions were held even during the evening. Kindly guide, its a suggestion. 

Secondly will the temporary stoppage until examinations are completed not affect the timeliness for the sessions that are ahead and the processes that are still outstanding.
16/08/23, 12:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, @48574536864 

However our working hours are 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM CAT, I have two slots for the sessions. First is 8:30AM to 9:30AM and other one is 2:00PM to 3:00PM.
16/08/23, 12:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Several of my students have rescheduled their sessions to a later time after their exams, as concentrating on their exams is crucial. Therefore, there's no need to be concerned.
16/08/23, 12:45 pm - +48 574 536 864: Thank you for the clarifications, it's well understood.
16/08/23, 12:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!

I am fine 
Not yet  l will update you when l am free
08/09/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings,  my proud Edoofian!

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately. Actually, we have initiated our orientation program in collaboration with our partner universities, which is why we were present at those institutions.
08/09/23, 8:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 8:39 am - +48 574 536 864: Waaal the Edoofian family is growing
08/09/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: Indeed! It was an amazing feeling to finally witness our students settling down here in India!
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 492 8058: Good afternoon mentor 
We are doing well
Thank you for understanding the situation and recheduling the time table for me
15/09/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 492 8058: I will prefer Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday  from 8.30 to 9.30.
I will try to manage and my parents will help me out
15/09/23, 4:42 pm - +48 574 536 864: Good afternoon, apology for late response, as parents we are ready to complete the initial sessions so that we move with the program
16/09/23, 7:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Cathrine!

I hope you are doing well. You know I am available today at 8:30 a.m. Shall we connect at that time?
16/09/23, 7:51 am - +48 574 536 864: Good Morning. We are well.
16/09/23, 7:52 am - +48 574 536 864: We can connect at that time it's okay
16/09/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Cathrine!

How are you doing today?
16/09/23, 8:42 am - +48 574 536 864: We are fine, how are you
16/09/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/09/23, 8:48 am - +48 574 536 864: Could you kindly refresh our memory so that we are at the same page
16/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
16/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
16/09/23, 8:53 am - +48 574 536 864: Thank you it's very clear and well understood
16/09/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
16/09/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/09/23, 9:16 am - +48 574 536 864: Waaal that very good, an also an eye opener to us who are still on the road to that

16/09/23, 9:21 am - +48 574 536 864: Thank you so much for the dedication and commitment which is evident.

The two objectives are to ensure that all Edoofians have equal opportunity to become competitive and cutting edge 21st century skills that gives them a cutting edge in terms of employment. 

The other one is to ensure that all edoofians get help to self finance their education
16/09/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers.

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that NAME will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

How are you? Are you ready for your session?🚀
20/09/23, 8:53 am - +48 574 536 864: Good Morning yes I am ready
20/09/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Cathrine can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 9:05 am - +48 574 536 864: That's Okay and it's in order
20/09/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.

SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
20/09/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

As per our discussion, she would resume his EWYL Process on 14th November. I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
19/10/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

07/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Cathrine and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.
24/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 492 8058: Ooh l didn't know,  thank you

30/11/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Cathrine!

Let's start our today's session with a smile: *Why did the bicycle fall over?*

Because it was two-tired! 😄
30/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 77 492 8058: Morning how are you
30/11/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 492 8058: My network is  very poor today
30/11/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so is it stable now?
30/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 492 8058: No it's not
30/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
30/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
30/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
30/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
30/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
30/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
30/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

01/12/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?



Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
01/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 492 8058: Q1 Versatile Academy,  not sure because some of my friends are doing this program 

Q2 l will start by sharing my experience about Edoofa and how it is helping me and other  students to achieve their dreams and goals. I will tell the school head about the EWYL program how it helps students to have their skills and experience on the future jobs. I will share some of my friends pictures who are already in India achieving their goals. I will tell them how the student earn credit through the EWYL program and mostly how expensive it is

01/12/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner.

01/12/23, 9:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.

04/12/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!

04/12/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now,since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
04/12/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 492 8058: Ok
04/12/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday-  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
04/12/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
04/12/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 492 8058: Ok
