*Dear Mentor, my name is Dalitso Dominic Banda, and my EWYL group name is Dalitso EWYL23E0793. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (24th of October) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*

I hope you are doing well. I have observed that there is a slight delay in commencing our EWYL program together. You know, I was occupied with an orientation program that took place at our various partner universities. In order to welcome all of my students, I visited each of those universities personally, which are in different cities. Following this, I was not feeling well and was under the weather for quite some time.

Kindly excuse me for the delay; however, now that I am fully recovered, I am all set to begin our EWYL journey together, along with a lot of exciting opportunities. We will start by understanding our projects and then work together to earn maximum scholarship credits so that you can finance your own education while learning 21st-century job skills!

So, are you ready to move forward with me on this exciting journey and conquer the world?🚀
01/12/23, 4:34 pm - +260 771023019: Yes am ready please 🙂

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯
