04/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon. 

I never knew about that. That’s true it has a major contribution not only in math but in computer programming as well
04/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dalitso, may I ask why are you late today?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I was escorting my friend to the hospital. He hasn’t been feeling well since morning
04/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What happened, Dalitso? Is he alright?
04/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: He got medication and the doctor said he will be fine after 4 days, he has had a high fever since he woke up and he said he felt weak and had nausea. He was found with malaria.
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, and it's good to know how caring you are for your friends.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: It’s the least I can do since they look out for me as well when I’m going through tough times
04/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Of course, the things I enjoy the most are having quality time with my friends, going for walks to admire nature, sometimes I enjoy watching the stars at night. During my spare time alone I watch some documentaries and movies or read some articles. 

My primary goal is to achieve the highest degree I can possibly reach. My secondary goals include completing my bachelor’s degree with a distinction, learning two or three skills that are valued on the market and if all goes well realize my dream to travel around the world

My passions… that’s a bit tricky but if I were to select one I am really interested in then it would be art
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's awesome! Your mix of interests is so diverse. Quality time with friends and nature walks sound so refreshing. Watching the stars is just magical, isn't it? 🌌 And your goals are ambitious – highest degree, distinction in bachelor's, skills, and world travel? That's the way to go!  

Also, art is fantastic. What kind of art are you drawn to? Painting, music, or something else? 🎨🎶 <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 2:51 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Thank you very much. 

I really like music poetry and drama. It’s mesmerizing how people can express so much emotion with a small amount of words and still be able to move the hearts of many people leaving different impacts on them. That’s where I see the beauty in art, everyone sees art differently and they translate it in the way they can relate to it and that is unique to everyone.
04/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as we close today's session, let me leave you with a thought: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs. Let this inspire us for tomorrow. Until then, take care, and let us connect tomorrow.🧠🏆
04/12/23, 4:23 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Will be looking forward to tomorrow as well
