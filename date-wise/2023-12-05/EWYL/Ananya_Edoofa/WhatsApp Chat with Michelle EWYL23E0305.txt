27/07/23, 7:50 am - Ananya Edoofa created group "Michelle EWYL23E0305"
27/07/23, 7:50 am - You were added
01/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 261 5346: Good morning Ms Ananya. I hope you're well!

Yes i am ready for the session
01/08/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
01/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 261 5346: Oh that's fantastic, i can't wait to start my higher education in India
01/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 261 5346: Are the two objectives to follow instructions and to have an open mind?
01/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 261 5346: How wonderful ,they seem all excited 🤗
01/08/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
01/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 261 5346: Alright I've understood the goals
01/08/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: MENTOR - Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
01/08/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 261 5346: Let me go through the letter
01/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 261 5346: I have gone through the newsletter ma'am
01/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Waiting for this message
01/08/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Waiting for this message
01/08/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

04/08/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: That is alright, Michelle! So may I ask if you were able to read the document?

04/08/23, 10:02 am - +263 78 261 5346: What I understood is that, the EWYL program will help me achieve my career goals and work torwads securing a bright future for myself.  It will also help me acquire skills that will be required to perform future jobs and awareness of how jobs of the future will look like. The EWYL program will also help me to acquire skills that are emerging such as social media literacy, creative content writing, data analytics and remote teamwork just to name a few. There are certain projects given to students so that they can earn scholarship credits to help them with their higher education, for instance there is project 1 where Edoofians will represent Edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employers and this will help them create a strong professional network and earn scholarship credits.  Then there is project 2 which is community building where by it is a field of practices directed towards the creation of community among individuals within a regional area or with a common need or interest. In this project, students are tasked to reach out to their personal and extended networks and offer them an opportunity to be part of Edoofa's educational ecosystem. Lastly there is project 3 which is named African schools education reform mission, whereby students are tasked to reach out to local schools in their region and will speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. In these projects, several skill sets are covered ,for example, networking skills, confidence, communication skills and how to use Google sheets. Payouts worth of scholarship credits are made after certain sections of the projects are completed.

08/08/23, 8:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
08/08/23, 8:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 261 5346: Alright
08/08/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
08/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 261 5346: It talks about the corporate alliance, the aim is to here is to understand the market that I'm going to work in, in future and to prepare for it at an early stage. A student will have to connect to companies that are technologically driven in their region through LinkedIn or through parents or relatives. Connecting with these companies will give students leverage which will help them in their future endeavors <This message was edited>
08/08/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Michelle. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

08/08/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 261 5346: Here, the task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa. The nature of the company must be either student centric or it could be recreational or it could be a content centric platform. The scale of the selected company should not be too small or too big and it should be financially sound. The company should have a founder with a strong background. Platforms that can be used are, Google, LinkedIn, crunchbase or social media pages like Facebook, Instagram and twitter. There are 6 steps used to complete the task.

14/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Alright noted
14/08/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
14/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Wonderful 🤩
14/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 261 5346: I'm following
14/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
14/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 261 5346: Alright
14/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
14/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
14/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
14/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
14/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

14/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
14/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

14/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
14/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
14/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
14/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
