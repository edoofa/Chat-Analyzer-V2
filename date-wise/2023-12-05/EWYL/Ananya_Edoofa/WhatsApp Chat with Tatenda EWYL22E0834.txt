03/10/23, 8:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
05/10/23, 10:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Tatenda, may I ask, is it really that difficult to accomplish the necessary tasks? I believe it wouldn't take more than 10 minutes to complete the task. It's quite disheartening when it seems like you're neglecting important tasks and my messages, especially when I'm always striving to do my best for you.
05/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 549 1711: I'm having difficulties with the reviews
05/10/23, 12:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What kind of difficulties, Tatenda?
05/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 549 1711: The steps that were done on the videos is different from what my phone is showing me
05/10/23, 12:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you share the screenshots with me?

10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL chat session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. To begin with, I would like to invite you to watch this incredible and relatable video:

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 1:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*URGENT*_
Good afternoon, Tatenda!

Even after many messages and reminders, you have not been able to complete your $300 training session with me. However, since this means a lot to me, and I believe in the impact it will have on your journey, I am here sharing the grant document with you and something discussed during the training.

So, I would like you to read and provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. Only after this will you be provided with the "Certified Student Leader" certificate.
25/11/23, 1:03 pm - +91 92893 26598: Okay ma'am

25/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
25/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *1. Different channels for finding potential students*

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
25/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
29/11/23, 1:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tatenda!

After scheduling multiple sessions with you for your $300 training, you could not attend those sessions. Being your mentor, I was concerned about you getting a certificate for student leadership. I even shared the pointers with you without you asking for them. Even after that, you could not share a 4-5 step summary with me?

It breaks my heart to see that even after so many efforts, you never reciprocate, even if these things are for your own benefit. After giving you a lot of days and considering everything, today I will be finalizing the list for Certified Student Leaders at 8:00 PM. If you can, submit your understanding before that.
29/11/23, 2:34 pm - +91 92893 26598: Hello miss Ananya
29/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tatenda!
29/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 92893 26598: I'm doing well miss Ananya
29/11/23, 2:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tatenda seems like you don't require the certificate for a certified Student leader, that's why you are not sharing your understanding with me.
29/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 92893 26598: Let me share my understanding now maam
29/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 92893 26598: I should reach out to potential students and share with them some questions those who pass the questions are the ones that will be accepted by Edoofa...l should give them an insight about Edoofa and make them understand more about Edoofa ,also share my experience with Edoofa and how it was an amazing journey coming here . Channels that can help me find students include Facebook Students community Building group and encourage the applicants to join the group , there is also juniors connect and school friends juniors connect,utilizing extracurricular clubs and societies, sports groups,parents friends ,.After that there is the lnternational Students Admission Eligibility Check
29/11/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! *Congratulations*

Now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our Edoofa Certified Student Leader🏆
29/11/23, 3:08 pm - +91 92893 26598: Understood ma'am
02/12/23, 6:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tatenda!

Time: *8:00 PM*

02/12/23, 8:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you know I rearranged my whole day just to ensure that you could attend your call and not miss out on any opportunities. However, even after extending my working hours, it is quite disappointing and disheartening that you did not attend the call. Can I know the reason behind this?
04/12/23, 6:19 am - +91 92893 26598: Maam lm not feeling well
04/12/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Tatenda!
