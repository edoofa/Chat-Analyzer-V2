23/08/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🛩️
23/08/23, 2:06 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes iam
23/08/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 2:07 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: No
23/08/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 2:11 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oooh oky mam i get it
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 2:22 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Ooooh this is nice so he earned alot
23/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/08/23, 2:24 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Thank you mam this is helpful
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Chisomo?
23/08/23, 2:28 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: It sound good
23/08/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
23/08/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 3:01 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Wow wow wow this is amazing I love everything in here just look how the young person is able to run a business this is so nice
23/08/23, 3:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
23/08/23, 3:21 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Same here but am gonna say part of everything together
23/08/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
23/08/23, 3:31 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: I love the part that says the is no shortcut in life we have to go every path of it , also like the part that say we don't have to be great in order to stat but we have to star in order to be come great and i also love the part that tells that we don't have to stay in the whole hiding the good things that is in us but we have to come out and give out the best that we can to the world no need to be shy
23/08/23, 3:31 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: So it is
23/08/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I've got some amazing news for you! We've gone ahead and scheduled your sessions from Monday to Friday, starting at 2:00 PM and running until 3:00 PM. And let me tell you, I just know you're going to blow us away with your incredible energy and enthusiasm every single day!

Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

25/08/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure?
25/08/23, 3:11 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Do i have to do both projects  or choose one ?
25/08/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you have to do all the three projects. There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
25/08/23, 3:14 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky mam

28/08/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

Additionally, the companies you share with us will be contacted by our team, so they can potentially offer you internships or projects.

28/08/23, 3:01 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Eeeeh but on finding the companies that will be very difficult for me
28/08/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. As of now, we have put this project on hold. As soon as we resume this we will have a separate session on this and trust me I will make it as easy as I can. Don't worry!

1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

29/08/23, 3:02 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky madam
29/08/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tomorrow is the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate the special bond they share. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection. In return, brothers often give gifts and offer their support.⭐

Therefore, we won't be connecting tomorrow, we shall connect on Thursday now!
29/08/23, 3:06 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oooh oky mam 
Its oky with me
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
31/08/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

31/08/23, 3:10 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky mam
01/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
01/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
01/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
01/09/23, 2:38 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Yes
01/09/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
01/09/23, 2:42 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: Oky mam
01/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
01/09/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Chisomo since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social medi
01/09/23, 2:48 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: I get you mam
01/09/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
01/09/23, 2:55 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: I don't have one
01/09/23, 2:56 pm - +265 996 65 13 53: My account on instagram was hacked
01/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You can create a new one, later.
01/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

01/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
01/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

CC is a term commonly used in email communication and refers to including additional recipients on an email message to keep them informed or to provide them with a copy of the message.
