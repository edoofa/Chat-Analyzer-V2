13/10/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so Valerie I hope you are aware that it is important for us to complete our basic understanding of the EWYL program to proceed further. So may I ask if you are available now?
13/10/23, 1:57 pm - +91 92893 20446: Yes
13/10/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/10/23, 2:00 pm - +91 92893 20446: Very nice to know a lot of exciting things about you Ananya
13/10/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you, Valerie! Do you understand what these two objectives are?
13/10/23, 2:04 pm - +91 92893 20446: No
13/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so e *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
13/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
13/10/23, 7:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa added +263 77 265 6142 and +91 93546 23922

18/10/23, 2:15 pm - +91 92893 20446: In brief the document is talking about the great opportunity being given in the ewyl. Whereby we don't  only earn money but also earn skills like awareness, social media literacy, digital literacy and more. In addition it has distinct projects,  project 1 mainly being about networking through companies in relation to edoofa. Project 2 being about the recruitment of the target market students to edoofa.

26/10/23, 2:20 pm - +91 92893 20446: Okay mam
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
26/10/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
27/10/23, 2:01 pm - +91 92893 20446: Okay mam
27/10/23, 2:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that our session for today has come to an end. Kindly share your answers before that session. Let's plan to reconnect on Monday, as our sessions are not scheduled for Saturdays and Sundays.🌟
30/10/23, 2:11 pm - +91 92893 20446: Let me ask from my parents mam
30/10/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
30/10/23, 2:19 pm - +91 92893 20446: Okay mam I'm on it!
30/10/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Valerie, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
30/10/23, 2:25 pm - +91 92893 20446: Okay mam
30/10/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Valerie, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
30/10/23, 2:27 pm - +91 92893 20446: Thank you for the tips
30/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate Wednesdays through EWYL Group. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
30/10/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 Week 1: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM


 Week 2: Call on Saturday


 Week 3: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM


 Week 4: Call on Saturday

08/11/23, 3:38 pm - +91 92893 20446: Okay mam
08/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To start, I'm sharing a document with you, specially crafted by our program director to assist with your project. We'll go through the entire document step by step, and in our first training session, we'll focus on the initial step:
- *Eligibility Criteria for an Applicant*

I guess 3 minutes should be enough to read the first step!
08/11/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 92893 20446: My network is not good mam
08/11/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you use someone else's phone?
08/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 92893 20446: Well understood mam
08/11/23, 3:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that you've gone through the first step, can you tell me about the different places or methods where you think we can find potential applicants?
08/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 92893 20446: I have also noticed that the other thing that is a hindrance in achieving ewyl projects is monotonous information at once. People do not want a long explanation but a  brief 1
08/11/23, 3:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely!
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 92893 20446: Whatsapp platforms many groups
Through online webs
Social media platforms like threads , instagram
08/11/23, 3:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To effectively help students apply for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, we can leverage various channels of communication:

*Facebook Student Community Building Group:*
We recommend creating a dedicated Facebook group exclusively for Edoofa scholarship applicants.
Encourage your peers to join and actively engage with fellow applicants.
Use this group to share important scholarship updates, application tips, and guidance to support one another in the application process.
*Juniors Connect:*
Consider reaching out and mentoring prospective scholarship applicants.
Junior scholars who have successfully navigated the process can share their experiences and offer guidance by answering questions from potential candidates.
*School Friends Juniors Connect:*
Encourage students from your school to connect with junior students who are interested in pursuing higher education through the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Your school can play a role in facilitating these connections and providing information about the scholarship program.
*Utilize Extracurricular Clubs and Societies/Sports Groups:*
Leverage the existing school clubs, societies, or sports groups to spread the word about the scholarship program.
Leaders of these clubs or coaches can inform their members about this valuable opportunity.
*Parents' Friends/Colleagues:*
Encourage your parents to inform their friends and colleagues who have eligible students about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
Word-of-mouth recommendations can be incredibly powerful in reaching potential applicants.
*Church Friends (if applicable):*
If you are part of a religious community, consider engaging with your church to reach out to potential scholarship applicants.
Church leaders can assist in sharing information about the scholarship program with their congregations.
*Relatives, Friends of Friends:*
It's essential to encourage students and their families to tap into their extended networks.
Friends of friends, distant relatives, and acquaintances can be informed about the scholarship opportunity.
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 92893 20446: Yes mam well noted
08/11/23, 3:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: In each of these communication channels, it's crucial to provide clear and concise information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Ensure that potential applicants are well-informed about eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and the benefits of the scholarship. Additionally, sharing success stories of past scholarship recipients can serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for those considering applying. The ultimate goal is to make the application process accessible and well-informed for all interested students.
08/11/23, 4:04 pm - +91 92893 20446: Noted
08/11/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.

Did you read those sample questions?
08/11/23, 4:07 pm - +91 92893 20446: Yes mam and that I can mine also
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes absolutely!
08/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, as an *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*, your responsibility is to share such questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.
08/11/23, 4:16 pm - +91 92893 20446: Okay mam
08/11/23, 4:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you proceed with the document, you should have also reviewed the available resources that provide quality answers to frequently asked questions. You can use these resources to enhance your conversations.

1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship Program? 

2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants? 

3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program. The Edoofa Program is the only International Education?

4) Why INDIA is a dream destination for Education for Africans?
08/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 92893 20446: Okay mam
Implementation of these questions can warm up the conversation
08/11/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I believe I have skipped mentioning the significance of the verification process through asking questions, and here it is:

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"
08/11/23, 4:20 pm - +91 92893 20446: The group is for authentication purposes 

Yes well understood
08/11/23, 4:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I have shared the basic protocols to be followed within the training program, I would like you to provide a step-by-step summary of how to proceed with the community-building project. I expect that you can do this in 5-6 minutes or less.
08/11/23, 4:28 pm - +91 92893 20446: We have to achieve the eligibility criteria by using the 3steps
Reaching out to potential applicants 
Informing the applicants 
Verifying the eligibility 

In this yo can use questions as a tool to help you give detailed and thorough information about edoofa to avoid wastage of time during counselling.
After this you proceed to share the information with edoofa and other resources to relate with the applicant like videos , experience questions why it is important to study in india
08/11/23, 4:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Seems like you have now clearly understood the process, and as a Edoofa Certified Student Leader I am sure that you will be able to have a clear mindset while attending to the students for your community-building projects. All the best!🚀
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - +91 92893 20446: Thank you mam
08/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me remind you about these two:

*Wednesday Wisdom* - Every Wednesday, you will receive a detailed lesson on a specific skill of the week. It follows a well-structured curriculum that promotes skill-based learning and enhances creativity among learners. To unlock the full potential of your learning journey, remember that it's not just about reading the lessons; it's about embarking on a quest where completing the tasks is your treasure map. Each task is a key that unlocks a new realm of knowledge and skills. So, don't just be a reader; be an achiever, a taskmaster who harnesses the true power of education.

*Saturday Activities* - In addition to excelling in academics, students need to acquire skills that will help them enhance the physical, artistic, and emotional aspects of their lives and succeed in this competitive world. Therefore, it is important to apply and revise what you learn in the Wednesday lesson. The Saturday activities motivate students to do the same.
08/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 92893 20446: Delighted to hear mam
08/11/23, 4:32 pm - +91 92893 20446: Noted
08/11/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let's conclude today's session. And here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Saturday activity_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline:* Monday, 25th November 2023
25/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 92893 20446: OK mam
25/11/23, 4:59 pm - +91 92893 20446: Spirit of competition is like the energy and excitement that comes when one participates in a competition. It's when you strive to do  your best, to win, and to improve Oneself. The spirit of competition is about bringing out the best in yourself and appreciating the efforts of others.
25/11/23, 5:07 pm - +91 92893 20446: in High School most of my classmates were getting good grades in a spelling bee competition it made me want to study harder and practice more words so you can do well too and l ended up being the Best among the Best

Spirit of Competition helps to motivate you and Push you to Achieve more
