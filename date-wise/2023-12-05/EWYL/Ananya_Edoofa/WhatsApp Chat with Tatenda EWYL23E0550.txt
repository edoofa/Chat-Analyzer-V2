22/09/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/09/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Thanks Ms Ananya
25/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
26/09/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
27/09/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 127 4828: Greetings mam
27/09/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 127 4828: I'm ok thanks how about you
27/09/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 127 4828: Yes
27/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
27/09/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let me tell you. So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/09/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 127 4828: No
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Ok l understand
27/09/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
27/09/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 127 4828: This is interesting
28/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🏆
28/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Good afternoon
29/09/23, 8:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want to highlight that it is important for you to be on time and regularly during your initial sessions. You know we are building our base so that you can earn credits for your education. 

I hope you will be there with me with a bit of dedication now.
29/09/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 127 4828: Yeah l will try
29/09/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,

29/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Afternoon yes
29/09/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tatenda?
29/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Sounds good
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
29/09/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
29/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Yes
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.
29/09/23, 3:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Our today's session time is over, let us connect in our next session which is on *Tuesday*. We do not have our sessions on Saturday and Sunday!

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.
29/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 127 4828: 1. There is you Ms Ananya who is going to guide me through my EWYL programme. From our conversation so far l think you are a good person and finds pleasure in seeing young minds grow and building their carriers
Secondly there is Mr. Angad who will be sharing his experience with me and l think it also motivates me through reading his articles. And me l guess since l will be a part of this 
2.to help me gain skills and experience that is gonna help me find a job someday and attain my goals
And help me  in financing my education through scholarship credits
3.A
4.I think that's something or thing that would inspire someone to build their goals or become a somebody in life
You know, wanting to be something great
More like a sort motivation that drives into pushing forward no matter what

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session? 🚀
10/10/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've noticed that you haven't been attending your EWYL  sessions on time, and your attendance has been inconsistent. I'd like to emphasize the importance of being consistent and regular in your participation during your EWYL journey.

Consistency is essential because without attending the sessions regularly, you won't be able to earn credits or receive crucial guidance that can benefit you in your journey.

It's important to stay committed and make attending these sessions a priority. Your active participation will not only help you gain the necessary knowledge and skills but also maximize the benefits of the EWYL program.
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Good day

10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Do you wish to change your time? We can connect early in the morning at 8:30am.
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 127 4828: But l will try my best to make it

10/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 127 4828: No this is ok 8.30 is worse
10/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Yes
10/10/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Tatenda! Let us connect tomorrow then!
10/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Ok thank you
11/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Tatenda,

Good afternoon. I trust you're doing well. In my ongoing efforts to enhance productivity and efficiency in preparation for your future education, I have devised a new timetable. This update includes a *change in the timing* of your EWYL sessions.

Starting today, our sessions are rescheduled to run from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.* I have faith that you'll be able to accommodate this new timing and join our sessions accordingly.
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Ok
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Afternoon

12/10/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

12/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 127 4828: Ok
12/10/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/10/23, 2:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

Best of Luck!

09/11/23, 10:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Thursday at 9:30 a.m.* once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 10:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
