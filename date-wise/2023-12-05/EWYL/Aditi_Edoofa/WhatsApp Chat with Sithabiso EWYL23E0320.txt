Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
03/08/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 909 1555: I have read the emails, this is a great job
03/08/23, 8:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I am sure that you must be motivated to earn even more credits.
03/08/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
03/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 909 1555: Lam pleased to see the great effort and work done by Mihlayonke. It is my wish and desire to do the same
03/08/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*

03/08/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well, it is.
03/08/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

14/08/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Sithabiso, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it!
14/08/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

14/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 909 1555: The audio is talking about community building. I understood that the goal of the community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in shared sense of responsibility and honorship towards achieving collective success. The project encourages students to have a mind set of identity opportunities and sharing them to create a impact in the lives of others.To successfully complete the project the students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools or those who are currently in their final year of secondary education.As member of team Edoofa students will be expected to use networking skills to refer students to the program. Throughout the project Edoofa will provide guidance. This helps students earn scholarship credits.
14/08/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: That’s awesome- Sithabiso, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

17/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 909 1555: Noted
17/08/23, 9:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them <This message was edited>

22/08/23, 9:06 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

22/08/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?
22/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 909 1555: I think there is the counseling stage 
The EWYL stage I'm not sure about the third stage
22/08/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same.
22/08/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
22/08/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
22/08/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
22/08/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.

22/08/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
22/08/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: -There is no deadline for the project.
-There is no order in which you have to do the project.
-There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
