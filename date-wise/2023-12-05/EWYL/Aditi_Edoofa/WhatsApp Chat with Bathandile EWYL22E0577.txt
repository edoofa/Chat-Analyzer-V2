The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

Hope you are well.

Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.
02/11/23, 4:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.

Project 1( corporate alliances)

Is all about Edoofians representing Edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employers.

Project 2 ( Community Building)

 it says students will reach out to their personal and extended networks and offer them an opportunity to be part of Edoofa's educational ecosystem and acquire international education which prepares them for their future .


Project 3. ( African schools Education Reform Mission.)

The project requires students to reach out to local schools in their local region and will speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa.

Project 4 is all about payment and incentive.

It says on every successful call or email response by the school to team Edoofa $2 will be credited to my balance.

Once the process begins l will be awarded with $10 worth of scholarship credits.

Additional incentive of $25 when 5 students complete enrollment from a particular school.
