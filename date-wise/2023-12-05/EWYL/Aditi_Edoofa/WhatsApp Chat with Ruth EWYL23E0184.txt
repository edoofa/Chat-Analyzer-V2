16/09/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Ruth!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Greetings... Let me inform my parents and see if they are able to attend the sessions
19/09/23, 1:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!

29/11/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon!
Hope you are well,

Let's begin with today's session🚀
29/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 598 7016: I'm good and you?

29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*RUTH/ADITI*
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/11/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

29/11/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/11/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
