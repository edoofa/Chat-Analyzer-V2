08/08/23, 10:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/08/23, 10:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *16 AUGUST 23 at 9:30 AM* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

12/08/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 146 3912: Good morning ma'am thank you
12/08/23, 11:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome Hove!
Well, I am very happy for you and I would like you to make sure that you will work with this discipline only and give your best to earn more and more credits.
12/08/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 146 3912: Ma'am I have read and understood the above letter but there is a slight mistake that I'm seeing I am Zimbabwean student not a Zambian

I will ask the team to correct the error, please excuse us for this error.

Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.
16/08/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 146 3912: Good morning maam ,its all thanks to you my mentors for pushing me up until i achievedthos great reward
16/08/23, 10:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Well that's why we are your mentors right.
16/08/23, 10:21 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 146 3912: yes maam im ready
16/08/23, 10:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 146 3912: Yes maam i understood
16/08/23, 10:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 146 3912: Im not sure maam
16/08/23, 10:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 10:50 am - +263 77 146 3912: Thank you for explaining i now understand and know
16/08/23, 10:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 146 3912: Yes maam i will indeed try my best so that i can earn more
16/08/23, 10:52 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 10:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 146 3912: Okay maam thank you
16/08/23, 12:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know if you have any queries regarding this?
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 146 3912: No maam all is clear
16/08/23, 3:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.
16/08/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 146 3912: yes maam i will print it and then sign
16/08/23, 3:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You can also sign it digitally, Hove.
16/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 146 3912: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
16/08/23, 3:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 146 3912: Yes maam they will be connecting with you as well
16/08/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, that would be great!

23/08/23, 10:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
hope you are well.
23/08/23, 10:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls when you would be in India.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities. <This message was edited>

Hope you are well.
21/10/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help as discussed.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

23/11/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

23/11/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on.
23/11/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 92891 45920: Yes maam
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 3:00 pm - +91 92891 45920: Yes maam
23/11/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.

Considering a total of 6 sessions with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
23/11/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	   September + October

23/11/23, 3:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program - to become job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors & industrial exposure - webinars) plus earning scholarship credits (via working on the projects).
23/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 92891 45920: Yes maam i will surely do so
23/11/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving further, By the end of December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits than the same.
23/11/23, 3:10 pm - +91 92891 45920: Yes i will
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, if I talk about you, Right now, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. I hope you understand that all it takes to be eligible for a grant is to be connected with your mentor regularly. As simple as that.
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me constantly, every day for the next 30 days as I envision a journey where we work closely together every day for the next 30 days and craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you win the grant.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 2:07 pm - +91 92891 45920: Good evening maam thank you
25/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome!
28/11/23, 1:59 pm - +91 92891 45920: From my own understanding The "spirit of competition" refers to the attitude or mindset with which people engage in competitive activities or challenging themsleves to reach certain goals  and archievement ,something that have never been done anyone . It embodies principles of fairness, respect, and sportsmanship. It's about striving to win while also acknowledging and respecting the abilities and efforts of others. In essence, it's the positive and respectful approach to competition

 This attitude of having a mindset  infuences me positively and most of the time its the reason why do not give up especially when i fail in archiving  certain goals . When ever i feel like um now giving up    , the spirit of competition always come back into mind and i start asking my self  so how did the other successful  individuals of my generation doing . In my mind i will raise a question of how did they make it up there  and these thoughts tracks me back to  my goals and the things i want to archive in my life . 

And it is this spirit of competition why i am here studying law in indai . It motivated me to take my education  internally ,to hold something bigger than just ordinary like  others . For me my passion is to do some that is recognised from the crowd .  There is a saying “If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort ,eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and your are ready for greater challenges.” And this can only be archived when one has a spirit of competition in thier mindset  giving exapmle of Elon Musk ,  and the founder of Amazon  just to mention a few .

And it is this spirit of competition why we are  here today  enjoying  this beautiful invention of technology and networks  where it is making our lives even more easier and overcome some challenges
28/11/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Hove!
How are you?
28/11/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your perspective on the "spirit of competition" is insightful and powerful. It's clear that you see competition not just as a rivalry but as a positive force that fuels personal growth and resilience. The emphasis on fairness, respect, and sportsmanship adds a dimension of integrity to the competitive mindset.

It's particularly inspiring to hear how this spirit of competition has been a driving force in your own journey, leading you to pursue education in law in India. Your commitment to aiming for something beyond the ordinary and your desire to be recognized for your contributions align with the principles of competition in a constructive and ambitious way.
28/11/23, 2:25 pm - +91 92891 45920: Im.okay maam how are you
28/11/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking.

Thank you Hove.
30/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 92891 45920: What i understoodnabout the wednesday wisdom is that analysis plays a crucial role for the future as its a skill that can set one apart from the rest.This skill.is not about completing given work but its about understanding the task given given ,by analyzing the task at hand ,key terms and inputs required to fulfil the requirements or do as assigned.Inputs:Firstly one has to consider the inputs when they are building or doing a certain task.These can be information,data,resources and even knowledge,To add on there is the identification of inputs so as to develop a process or plan.More so the result of all efforts is then processed and put to ground.Lastly learning from mistakes is about celebrating sucess.
30/11/23, 3:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your understanding of Wednesday Wisdom is insightful. The emphasis on analysis as a crucial skill for the future is well-appreciated. Indeed, it goes beyond mere task completion, focusing on a deep understanding of the given work. The consideration of inputs, such as information, data, resources, and knowledge, is a foundational step in building or executing a task. Identifying these inputs helps in developing a strategic process or plan. The evaluation of results from all efforts is crucial, and learning from mistakes is highlighted as a pathway to celebrating success. Well articulated!
30/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 92891 45920: Yes maam indeed true
