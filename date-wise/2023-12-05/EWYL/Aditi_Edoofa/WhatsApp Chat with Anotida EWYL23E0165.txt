23/09/23, 9:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
23/09/23, 10:02 am - +27 71 486 9544: Good morning. Sorry for not responding in time. Iam currently at work and will respond to some of the issues after 12.
May I indicate that at the school where Anotida is attending Cellphone are totally prohibited. I have mentioned this before. It's a Christian boarding school with very strict rules. 
May I respond to some of the issues late
23/09/23, 10:22 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, Which is why we are asking if you can attend on behave.
23/09/23, 11:53 am - +27 71 486 9544: I long suggested in May and i can even send you the response given to this request
23/09/23, 11:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, could you choose one slot?
23/09/23, 12:03 pm - +27 71 486 9544: Unfortunately non of the sessions indicated will suit both me and my wife. Our working ours are 7am- 5pm Monday. Friday and 7am- 3pm Saturday
23/09/23, 12:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: I will get back to you on Monday and see what we can do.
23/09/23, 12:19 pm - +27 71 486 9544: Ok
We could have completed the sessions way back in May or June if our request as parents for doing it on her behalf was considered
23/09/23, 12:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, I am sorry for the same.
23/09/23, 12:24 pm - +27 71 486 9544: It's okay
29/09/23, 10:32 am - +91 78273 08969: Dear Anotida,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

30/11/23, 3:27 pm - +27 71 486 9544: I am sorry about that. I can't get hold of her either. I will check on the possible challenges that could have prevented her from being online

01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for today's session?🚀
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Yes
01/12/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Can you share what you've retained till now from your EWYL Sessions so that we can resume from that point?
01/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 575 2245: EWYL is a program that help students pay their funds .it is a program that awards students according to the hard work they perform
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
01/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 575 2245: It helps to reduce fees by earning scholarship credits.
01/12/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
01/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Ok
01/12/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
01/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Yes
01/12/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

01/12/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
01/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 575 2245: Yes it is
01/12/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
