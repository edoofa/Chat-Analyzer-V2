Hope that you are well.

I have noticed that you have put your EWYL journey on hold for a long time, so may I know when you will be able to resume your EWYL Journey so that we can together embark on this amazing journey and I can help you earn credits and make your journey smooth and fruitful.

Hoping for a quick and positive response. <This message was edited>
