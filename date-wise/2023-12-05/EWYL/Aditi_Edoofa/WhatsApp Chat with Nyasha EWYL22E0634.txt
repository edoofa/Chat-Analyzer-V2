I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. 
I wanted to take a moment to address my absence yesterday. 
Yesterday was my birthday and I took the day off to celebrate with my loved ones.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, and I assure you that we will catch up on any missed learning content in our next session. 
I value your dedication and commitment to our course, and I appreciate your understanding.
[28/03, 20:16] Rithvik Rana: Also, I wanted to inform you that we will not be having any sessions this week. I will be away on a visit to our partner universities, and I will not be able to conduct our regular sessions.

I understand this may cause some inconvenience, and I apologize for disrupting your schedules. However, this visit is an important opportunity for me to learn from our students who are studying in these partner universities and bring back new ideas and perspectives that we can apply to our journey.

We will resume our regular sessions the following week, and I look forward to seeing you all then. Please make sure that you are available for our session next week because we will be discussing our plan for April then.

Have a week ahead!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
