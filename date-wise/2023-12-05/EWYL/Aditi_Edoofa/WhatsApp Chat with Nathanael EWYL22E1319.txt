This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. The icing on the cake? We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

16/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Nathanael !

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
01/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 537 3949: Sorry for the very late response but I think the second option is good
03/10/23, 7:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.
03/10/23, 7:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, then we will meet on Saturday for your session.
Be on time.
03/10/23, 8:20 am - +263 71 537 3949: Okay ma'am
07/10/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Nathanael!
