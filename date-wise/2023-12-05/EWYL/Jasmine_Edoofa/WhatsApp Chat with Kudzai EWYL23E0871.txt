09/11/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Tuesday i.e 14 November 2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
14/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 727 2005: Not really. Please shed some light on it

14/11/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
14/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 727 2005: Three projects are:

In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
15/11/23, 8:28 am - +263 78 727 2005: Glad to know that
15/11/23, 8:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
15/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay I will make sure I'm actively participating
15/11/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
15/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
15/11/23, 8:37 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
15/11/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 727 2005: ✍️Noted.
15/11/23, 8:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
15/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
15/11/23, 9:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

Is a project that looks into us the Edoofa members to dive deep into the community and raise awareness to the people in my very own community so that they know about the Edoofa program and also that they are not reluctant to join while earning scholarship credits.
21/11/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 727 2005: Thats my understanding on the three projects

To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms

LinkedIn Profile Link: <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 727 2005: I already have an Instagram account
22/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 727 2005: But I will have to create the rest
22/11/23, 6:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries."

22/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 727 2005: As of now I do not have any questions
22/11/23, 6:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
22/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
22/11/23, 6:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Kudzai!
22/11/23, 6:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good morning Kudzai*_,
I hope all is well with you. I wanted to share that your session was scheduled in the evening yesterday to avoid any issues. *However, I'm somewhat disappointed to see that you left the session abruptly without any notice.*

I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, causing disruptions to your session. However, I believe it's the responsibility of the student to communicate such situations to their teacher so that we can formally conclude our session. 
Is it too much to expect this courtesy?
23/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 727 2005: It's not too much to expect
23/11/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, So may I know that have you gone through the audio?
23/11/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 727 2005: Yes I have gone through the audio
23/11/23, 8:54 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
23/11/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 727 2005: Firstly the audio is about community building
23/11/23, 8:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay
23/11/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 727 2005: Can I use audio to explain the rest
23/11/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: No dear. I would really appreciate if you could write it down
23/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay so let me write it down
23/11/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 727 2005: So the second project is about extending the network to youths who wish to further their education while we build the community. It enhances my mindset to identify such opportunities and persuasion skills.
23/11/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 727 2005: For every student who pays for the initial amount I gain scholarship credits. Which is an opportunity to make an impact and a difference in the community I live in
23/11/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That’s awesome- Kudzai, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
23/11/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?
23/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 727 2005: Yes I'm ready
23/11/23, 9:35 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, You have to share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they deserve to be Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

23/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 78 727 2005: Is this all for today?

23/11/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
23/11/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_
23/11/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
23/11/23, 10:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 727 2005: The audio simply states how to put the community building project into motion. For starters, I have to create a WhatsApp group and reach out to as many students as possible and share information about the scholarship program through even unofficial groups of my own colleagues and people in the community to expand awareness and also persuade them using catchy line as you mentioned.
23/11/23, 11:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Kudzai, I am impressed with your understanding.
23/11/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 727 2005: Thank you
23/11/23, 12:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
It was lovely talking to you and I will see you in our session tomorrow. 
Till then Take care
24/11/23, 8:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Morning Kudzai_*
I hope you are doing well. 

This is to remind you that you have your session today with me from *8:30 am to 9:30 am*
Make sure that you are on time.
24/11/23, 8:01 am - +263 78 727 2005: Thank you for the reminder
24/11/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 727 2005: I'm ready to begin
24/11/23, 8:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you doing Kudzai?
24/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 727 2005: I'm doing just fine
24/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 727 2005: How are you?
24/11/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
24/11/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yesterday, we were discussing about Project 2. 
Do you remember?
24/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 727 2005: Yes I do remember
24/11/23, 8:42 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
24/11/23, 8:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
24/11/23, 8:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: May I know that were you able to read my above messages?
24/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 727 2005: I'm still reading
24/11/23, 8:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Kudzai
24/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay I've understood this
24/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
24/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 727 2005: I've gone through the entire content
24/11/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
24/11/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 727 2005: So it's about African school reform whereby I'm tasked to reach out local schools in my region and connect with the headmasters of those schools. I tell them how I have planned my future and ask if they can set up an online meeting with Edoofa. I then share the contact details with you my mentor
24/11/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Kudzai.
24/11/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
24/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
24/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 727 2005: However, I have a question.
24/11/23, 9:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you set up our meeting with them, you can ask them to fill up the form that will be shared by me in a while. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details via this form.
24/11/23, 9:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *School Details*:

1. School Name: 
2. School Province: 
3. Name of the contact person: 
4. Designation of the contact person:
5. Whatsapp Number:
6. Year of the establishment of the School: 
7. Pass% of A level (Last Academic year): 
8. No. of teachers in School:
9. The number of students in A level: 
10. Fee structure in A level (Per Term in USD): 
11. Date of Call:
12. Time of the scheduled meeting (CAT):


*Details submitted by*:
1. Full Name:
2. EWYL Group Name: 
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
24/11/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 727 2005: I've understood
24/11/23, 9:20 am - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
24/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
24/11/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
24/11/23, 9:23 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
24/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 727 2005: Okay
24/11/23, 9:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Wonderful, it's time to conclude our session. I hope you enjoyed our conversation.

As the weekend approaches, I encourage you to take this time to recharge and refresh. *Let's reconvene with full energy on Monday at 8:30 am.*
Wishing you a Happy Weekend!
24/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 727 2005: Same to you. Have a wonderful weekend!

28/11/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
28/11/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
28/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 727 2005: Alright
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now you can text on the Line and I will get back to you there in a while.
