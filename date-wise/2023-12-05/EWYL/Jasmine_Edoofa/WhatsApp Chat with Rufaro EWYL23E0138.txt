10/08/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

10/08/23, 2:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

11/08/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 815 3991: 1: the three projects include corporate alliances, community building and African schools reform mission
11/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Firslt from what i have understood from the corporate alliance is that it helps Edoofians to build networking website link called Linkledin. It also builds confidence , good communication skills and use of google sheet. Students will identify local organization and companies, identify the decision makers in  these organization and also reaching out to yhede individuals to share Edoofa's visiobs arranging video calls and finally facilitating the signing of the contract
11/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 815 3991: The second project is community building where chikdren will reach out to their personal and extended network and offer them the opportunity to be a part of Edoofa's educational system. This project students are expected to have amazing persuasion skills. This enables one to gain a specified amount of scholarship credits
11/08/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Then lastly the african schools education reform mission project . This envolves reaching out to locap higher secondary schools and identifying these decision makersin these schools and for evry call one is gaining a specific amount of scholarship credits

29/08/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
I hope you are doing well. IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
31/08/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 707 5754: First I need to create a WA group. Inorder to identify other potential students I need to join also their interactive group's and share my link. After having people in the grp I will also have to add u  as my mentor to check if I'm giving them correct information. Purpose of this grp is to reach a large audience n it uses less energy
31/08/23, 1:50 pm - +263 71 707 5754: It will also enable other students to hv an easy counselling session
31/08/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Rufaro. I am impressed with your understanding. 

While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message - <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 1:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
31/08/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Ok
31/08/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
31/08/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Ok
31/08/23, 1:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Wow
31/08/23, 2:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
31/08/23, 2:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 707 5754: My duty is to connect with headmasters at nearby schools and inform about Edoofa
31/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 707 5754: I will have to arrange a meeting with the headmaster and my Edoofa mentor
31/08/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Rufaro.
31/08/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​

I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organized. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?

13/09/23, 7:39 am - +263 71 707 5754: <Media omitted>

13/09/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 707 5754: Hello hw are u today
13/09/23, 1:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I think you have shared this in a wrong group

13/09/23, 1:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly answer these questions
13/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Q1 :St Killians high
Q3:manicaland province
13/09/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
13/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Ye I agree
13/09/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
13/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Head of any school?
13/09/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Rufaro
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Can you give me an example of a particular message I can send
13/09/23, 2:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Sure
13/09/23, 2:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
13/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Yes
13/09/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
13/09/23, 2:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],

13/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Ok

13/09/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you go through all the information, and see that this can be a million opportunities for your school, then please help me fill out the form so that the Program Director of Edoofa can contact you.

13/09/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 815 3991: Ok that's good
13/09/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
13/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.

So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Wednesday i.e 15 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am* <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 10:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
