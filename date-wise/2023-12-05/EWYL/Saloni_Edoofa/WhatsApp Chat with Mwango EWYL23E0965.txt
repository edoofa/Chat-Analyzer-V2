04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, do let them know to share their ideas on this!
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Mwango, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +260 95 3411232: In the long run, my goal as a biochemistry student is to play a pivotal role in advancing scientific knowledge, particularly in the realm of healthcare. I aspire to contribute to groundbreaking research, with a focus on developing new drugs or therapies that can address prevalent health challenges. Beyond that, I see myself taking on leadership roles in research projects, collaborating with experts, and striving to make tangible contributions to the field.

Furthermore, my passion extends to the realm of education. I envision a future where I can share my acquired knowledge and experiences with aspiring individuals. Whether through teaching at the university level or engaging in research institutions, I aim to inspire and guide the next generation of scientists. Overall, my long-term goals revolve around making meaningful contributions to biochemistry, both in terms of scientific advancements and the mentorship of future professionals in the field.
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 95 3411232: The Edoofa "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) program aligns with my long-term goals by providing a practical avenue to support my education financially. As I engage in the program, earning credits that can be applied toward my annual university fees, it significantly reduces the financial burden associated with my studies. This financial flexibility, facilitated by the EWYL program, allows me to focus more on my biochemistry studies and research aspirations.

Moreover, the program offers a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience and practical skills, which can complement my academic knowledge. The exposure to real-world applications of biochemistry through the EWYL program could enhance my readiness to contribute meaningfully to scientific research and drug development in the long run. Overall, the financial support and experiential learning provided by EWYL create a supportive environment for me to pursue and achieve my ambitious goals in the field of biochemistry.
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is amazing, you have shared in-depth information about your goals really well, and I am super delighted to go through it!
04/12/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 95 3411232: No
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 95 3411232: I understand
04/12/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
04/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 95 3411232: . I'll be there with the same zeal and enthusiasm at my given slot (01:30-02:30 PM) in the EWYL Group. Thank you for the reminder!
04/12/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is amazing, see you tomorrow!
