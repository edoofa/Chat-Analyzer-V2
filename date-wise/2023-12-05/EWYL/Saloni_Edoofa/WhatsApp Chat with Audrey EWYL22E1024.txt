21/11/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
21/11/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 695 9500: Ohhk ma'am

21/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details.

21/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 695 9500: My pleasure

21/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 695 9500: I understood that my task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa which are willing to extend their help in the overall development of all students that enroll for the Edoofa program

To make sure that l look for the right type of companies there are factors that l should take into consideration which are :
-Nature of company,the company must either be student centric or recreational
-Scale of company must not be too big or small
-Financial stability 
- Background of founder 
Platforms that can be used are Google, LinkedIn etc
To keep factors into consideration l have to follow steps wch are :
1. Searching for startup news
2. Study a little more about the company
3. Study the website of the company
4. Check the various Social media pages of the company
5. Study the background of the founder and other co members
6. Reach out to the people by dropping invitation notes and finding a connection request

23/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 695 9500: I understood that

-Community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community 
- The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promote social introduction and participation 
- The primary outcome of this project is for students to level up networking and their persuasion skills and learn how to leverage social media to African students
- This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to creating impact in the life of others 
-  To successfully complete this project students are required to reach out to African students who recently graduated from the senior secondary school or that are currently in the final year of senior secondary education
- As a member of team Edoofa students are expected to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer other students to the program and help the organizations
- Throughout the project Edoofa will provide guidance and support and make sure students are successfully in their efforts
- Edoofa provides students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits

01/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 695 9500: Ohhk thank you
01/12/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Audrey/Saloni/1DEC2023*
01/12/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
01/12/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
01/12/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
01/12/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
01/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 695 9500: Sorry ma'am I don't understand
