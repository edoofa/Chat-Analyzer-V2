How are you?
29/08/23, 10:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Barnabas, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

17/10/23, 3:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you also share this?

I am so unhappy seeing all this. You are such a bright student and in the past few weeks, you have started to take all my efforts and follow-ups for granted. Is that so Barnabas?
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - +91 78883 87558: My phone was not working good.
So I have to buy a new one.
It is miss behaving

I think I should figure out why

17/10/23, 3:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What are they not happy about?

I am absolutely overjoyed for you, and as your elder sister, this accomplishment fills me with immense pride🥺. Our connection goes far beyond the mentor-mentee dynamic, and I believe this is the perfect beginning for you. When I spotted your name, it was as if destiny had whispered that you possess the skills and potential for this opportunity🫶🏻
19/10/23, 9:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: I personally spoke to Mr. Anik on your behalf, and your selection has our wholehearted support. We're all rooting for you in every task you undertake. Please remember to submit your work before the strict deadline of 8 PM today. You've got this!📍

20/10/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263773810759 Barnabas was given an amazing opportunity a month ago and he was asked to get you over the conversation here but I saw no response so I thought to personally reach out to you.
20/10/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: As part of the community-building project, the students have the opportunity to share their Edoofa journey with their peers, neighbors, classmates, relatives, and cousins. They can introduce them to what Edoofa is, and how it can benefit them, and share your own inspiring story. If they show interest, you can provide them with a student application form, and once they've filled it out, share their forms with me. Your enthusiasm and willingness to help others embark on a similar path are truly commendable. 🌟🌍📚
20/10/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: In the past, for the community building project, the student earned a total scholarship credit of $50. But now, we're excited to offer you an opportunity to earn not just $100, not even $200, but an impressive $300 for each student application form you submit to us!
20/10/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here's the breakdown of this incredible $300 opportunity:
 You'll receive $75 if the referred student pays partial enrollment fees of $200.
 An additional $25 will be yours if the referred student pays the remaining $150 as partial enrollment fees.
1. Basically, hit the complete enrollment mark, and you'll receive a solid $100 ($$75+$25) as a reward.
2. When the referred student pays the complete registration fees, another $100 is yours.
3. And the cherry on top, you'll earn a whopping $100 if the referred student makes the journey to India.
20/10/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what you feel about this opportunity given to Barnabas?

01/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Barnabas, I want to reiterate the core essence of the EWYL Program, which was initially explained to you by the counseling team when you were considering joining the Edoofa family. I have emphasized this on several occasions, and I believe it's important to clarify once more.

The EWYL Program is designed to serve a dual purpose. Firstly, it offers you opportunities to acquire essential skills through webinars, internships, and projects. Secondly, its primary focus has always been on empowering you to become self-sufficient. If this were a common offering by other organizations, you might have had second thoughts about becoming a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
01/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: My role in this journey is not only to guide and support you but also to make you feel like a part of our extended family. I am committed to helping you achieve these two objectives that are pivotal for your personal and financial growth. I do admit that I have a vested interest in witnessing your growth, Barnabas. However, if at any point you believe that this program no longer contributes to your development, you have the option to opt out of the EWYL Program. Your growth and success remain our top priority, and we respect your choices and aspirations in this regard.
03/11/23, 5:03 pm - +91 78883 87558: Well , Thank you with the explanation. I like EWYL program very well but I didn’t know think that you will be putting pressure on us when we don’t perform well as you expect.
I thought EWYL is there to add skills and amounts to student but then it seems like it’s a mandatory that is supposed to be done at your expected performance.

This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,

This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
_Ms. Saloni Rastogi_
