04/10/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Praymore

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
04/10/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

1).  What are the benefits of the Edoofa scholarship program?. 

-Edoofa is a work study program for international students to study in India .


-Edoofa program offers a guaranteed minimum scholarship percentage of 50% to students all over the world . 

-Edoofa has partnered with the TOP Universities in India to obtain a higher scholarship for its students.

-This program also offers internship and industry_oriented training through live projects and digital internship that are embedded into the university curriculum.

-Through Edoofa's EWYL program, students get opportunities to earn scholarship credits to further reduce their fees and self- finance their higher education .

- The EWYL program includes weekly training sessions and mentorship which is provided to help students learn valuable 21st century skill.

-Graduates finished their degrees without a financial burden and with years of work experience, making them more employable .


2) What is the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program?.


-EWYL program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on the student's performance)that is equivalent to physical cash . 

However , the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. It is more beneficial to the parents and sponsors .


3)What Does a student's journey look like with the Edoofa scholarship program ?.


(First step)

-A student is encouraged or required to to fill out the application form for the Edoofa program . Identifying gender, name , year of admission and all details of the student's parents.


(Second step)

-Then they connect with the expert Career councilor for noe on one counseling sessions. Parents are also welcome to join the discussion and share their thoughts there . As for me , my councilor was Mr Kunal and Mr Austin. 


(Third step)

-The student is required to clear the Eligibility check interview with the Edoofa program Directors and Academic Board members .


(Forth step)

-On clearing up the interview, a student receives the letter of acceptance which shows that the Edoofa team accept the student to proceed with the Edoofa scholarship program and that document is very important since it not attainable by everyone.


(Fifth step)

-The student then connects with the Edoofa's Admission team and get their Statement of Purpose ( SOP)prepared and along side they start finalizing their university Admission. The student is intended to pay the registration fee which range from $500 to $700 dollars . But as for me , l have paid $ 600 . 


(Sixth step)


-The student also work hand in hand with the EWYL mentors to gain and earn scholarship credits.


( Seventh step)


- Student prepares for travel to India ( Visa assistance is provided by the admission team ) .


(Eighth step)

- Then the Edoofian  students land  in India and live their higher education in abroad.


4).Write in detail about one of the students testimonials?.

-I want to talk about  Munashe Maushe an Edoofian at Lovely Professional University  , one of my brother in Zimbabwe    l . He says "Edoofa scholarship program has provided me with on my journey towards higher education in India . Edoofa has been nothing short of a life changing experience for me . From the moment l was accepted into the program , l could feel the genuine commitment and dedicated of the edoofa team to help students like me achieve their dreams . " Here are some key highlights of his experience : Financial assistance; the Financial assistance he receives from Edoofa made it possible to pursue his higher education in India . This scholarship has alleviated a significant financial burdens and allowed him to focus on his studies without worrying about tuition fees. Mentorship: he says the mentorship and guidance provided by edoofa have been invaluable . He had the privilege of being mentored by experienced professionals who have not supported him academically but also provided career advice and encouragement . Cultural Immersion; studying in india through Edoofa scholarship gives him the opportunity to immerse himself in a rich and diverse culture . It's been an eye opening experience that has broadened his horizons and expanded his worldview . Community: Edoofa has fostered a sense of community among it's scholarship recipients. He had the chance with fellow students from around the world . He also says , the soft skills and leadership training has been instrumental in his personal growth . 


Conclusively , I can say that Edoofa has been instrumental in helping students  attaining their dreams of higher education in India . This program is not just about providing the Financial aid , it is about nurturing talent , Fostering personal growth and creating global citizens .

We must visit those hierarchy and share Edoofa's vision to them and the work done by Edoofa scholarship program. After we perform all those tasks , the student must arrange for a video call or a call between the organization management and the  Edoofa team .

In order to perform all these tasks ,  EWYL program share with me some instructional details on how to perform such task . I can not list it since it is only a guide line on how to complete my project.

3) What l understand from  PROJECT 2:( Community Building).

# My understanding;

-under this project , students must reach out to the African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools either recently or in the past 6 months . The objective of chasing these students is that , we have to refer them to the Edoofa scholarship program and become all the part of the edoofa team . 

To undertake such task , students must adopt the the skills of super networker and have an amazing persuasion skills so that we can be in a position to lure or to attract the candidates into the program ..

In order to perform such task, the EWYL team support us with the instructional details which can help me to complete the task in a remarkable way . 


The benefits of performing such task is that.;

For every student that get enrolled into the edoofa scholarship program and pay the enrollment fee, l can get $20 worth of scholarship credits . 

Moreover , if that student complete the Admission formalities of university , l will get $30 worth of scholarship credits. 

Further more, there is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of scholarship credits per student that Edoofa team connects with me for clarity on the program.


4)What l understand on PROJECT 3(African schools Education Reform Mission)

#my understanding;

This task is performed to students in schools that is , Senior secondary schools .Edoofa has taken has a mission to help African schools grow using decade old experience of it's team. 


The benefits of this project is that , for every successful call or email response by the school to team edoofa , l will be rewarded $2 . One the process begins , i will be rewarded with $10 worth of scholarship credits . And $25 when 5 students completes enrollment from a particular school .

Due to use online facilities, i can simply connect with the highly techonlogical and technical companies. My task on this project is to identify those companies within my region . To accomplish this stage, l can use some of the people who work on those service departments  like my friend's parents.

To search for those companies, l can open a LinkedIn account which helps me to connect with such companies. I can connect with the human resources Management of that business and so on

07/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
07/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
07/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
07/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

Looking forward to our session.
14/11/23, 1:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you very much! Wishing you a joyous and prosperous Diwali as well.
14/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Good afternoon Ms Sharda, long time no talking , how was the holiday, thank you for updating me l will be available
14/11/23, 1:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon! It's wonderful to hear from you. I trust your holidays were also as rejuvenating and filled with moments of joy as mine. Thank you for your update and letting me know about your availability.
14/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
14/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
14/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes maamet find a day where teachers are not busy  so that they can help me to connect with you , as for now they are busy invigilating exam class
14/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 847 3819: I will search for the headmaster's office number so that you will get connected with her
14/11/23, 1:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Praymore
14/11/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
14/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Yes ma'am, you can share with me
14/11/23, 1:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.

I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
14/11/23, 1:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Praymore*, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.
14/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Thank you ma'am
14/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 847 3819: But how can l send the message , do l print it or l just send it through internet
14/11/23, 1:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: through WhatsApp only.
14/11/23, 1:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
Here are some of the facts that will definitely help you out.
14/11/23, 1:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a scholarship program that has the potential to fulfill all the dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA - Education For All.

14/11/23, 1:59 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Okay

14/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
14/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
14/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 847 3819: Well noted ma'am , l understand but before this , l have to talk with my headmistress first so that she will know all these stages so that she will strategize her time accordingly

We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice.

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!
