I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes. <This message was edited>

09/11/23, 12:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Hey Charlotte!*

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.
09/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
09/11/23, 12:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would like to let you know that *we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali,* a significant Indian festival.🪔

 We will *reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want you to complete above mentioned *Diwali Activity*.
09/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 187 1838: Happy Diwali mam  .this is the ferstival of light right where you will light up candles and smash each other with different colours. I saw it on Indian soap dramas
09/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 187 1838: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 4:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Evening Charlotte
I hope you are doing well

Happy Diwali! I appreciate your festive wishes. Diwali is indeed known as the Festival of Lights, where people illuminate their homes with lamps and candles to symbolize the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. However, the aspect of smashing each other with different colors is more associated with another Indian festival called Holi. Both festivals hold cultural significance and are celebrated with joy and enthusiasm. If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to know about Diwali or Indian festivals, feel free to ask!

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.
