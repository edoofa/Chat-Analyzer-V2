11/01/23, 1:53 pm - You were added
03/08/23, 11:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings and a lovely morning to you my dear student!
15/09/23, 9:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tarrio

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 2:48 am - +263 71 241 2855: Thank you very much for the information. I would like to advise that Bessie Tariro is not with us these days. She is at a boarding school and they are not allowed to use cellphones. Can we do our part as parents then you can talk to her when she is through with her examinations. We are comfortable with afternoon seasons 2pm to 3pm.
18/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Noted thank you
18/09/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Sorry got tied up with work. Let's get on with it tomorrow
20/09/23, 2:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well.

Kindly connect with within our scheduled time so that we can finish our training and discussion.
21/09/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 

Hope you are doing well!

It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
21/09/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Yes l am ready
21/09/23, 4:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that the session time is over, we will connect tomorrow at our scheduled time.
Have a great day!
22/09/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon 
I hope you are doing well

Are you available for today's session?
22/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Yes
25/09/23, 2:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Happy Monday*
I hope you are doing well

Are you ready for today's session?
25/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Yes
25/09/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Tariro* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/09/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Tariro* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
25/09/23, 2:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 241 2855: Thanks very much for the information. I am sorry to say Bessie won't be able to link with us and you until end of November 2023. She is at school preparing for her final A level examinations. She is not allowed to use a cellphone. I hope you don't mind linking with her once she is through with her examinations.
25/09/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes yes no need to worry about that. I just wanted a basic session with you. Once she will be back we will connect again.
25/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 241 2855: 1. Well crafted booke help us understand our past history and helps us mould our future and how we should relate in the communities we leave.                                  2.

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. 

Since I did not get any response from you, I wanted to know if everything is alright at your end. May I know what is the ongoing challenge?

I also wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.
