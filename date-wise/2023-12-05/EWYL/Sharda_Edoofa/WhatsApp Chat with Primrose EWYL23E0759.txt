11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Primrose!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
11/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Greeting to you, yes I am ready
11/10/23, 1:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: First thing first, *_Congratulations_* ✨
On being awarded the Edoofa scholarship, *Primrose*! This is a fantastic opportunity to expand your horizons, gain new experiences, and make memories that will last a lifetime.
You should feel proud of this achievement, as it is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and determination.
This scholarship is an opportunity for you to grow as an individual, learn about new cultures and ways of life, and achieve your dreams.
All the best!
11/10/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 
I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better. 
In case you face any problems while viewing the video, please let me know.
11/10/23, 1:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 305 0093: our network this side is poor so downloading might ake some time
11/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Thank you I have managed to listen to vedio
11/10/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: you are welcome please1
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, you are already aware of the EWYL Program. If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
11/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I am not yet aware.of the finer details of EWYL. however i was made to understand that its all about giving an opportunity to the child to gain work experience while working. This makes her chances of employability high. That is giving her opportunity for internship, volonteering in credible organisations. If she works hard in this area she will earn credits which would increase the percentage of her scholarship
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Primrose* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I am following
11/10/23, 4:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Primrose* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Primrose* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I have gone through it and now appreciate what the founder will be sharing
12/10/23, 2:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Warm Greetings!
It brings me great joy to welcome you to today's scheduled session. 

Let's make the most of this time and engage in meaningful discussions.
So, are you ready for today’s session?
13/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I can see my network is bad
13/10/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for letting me know about this. It is alright.
13/10/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Primrose*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Primrose* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
13/10/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Primrose* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
13/10/23, 3:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
13/10/23, 3:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 3:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Is everything clear until now?*
13/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Yes everything is clear let me go through the documents you shared
13/10/23, 3:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: okay
13/10/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Primrose* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Primrose* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
13/10/23, 3:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
13/10/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Please choose a batch for the sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
13/10/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In the sessions (that will be happening on the days chosen), the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter will be discussed.
13/10/23, 3:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *THIRD*- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact):  +91 98107 89170


*FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*


*FIFTH* -Once the sessions are resumed then  Every day *Primrose*  have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
13/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 305 0093: There are a few areas which I need further explanation. First, your prosective student Primrose as I said from the start is at school and does not have an access to a device, so isn't she being left behind?
13/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Also since on both Monday and Thursdays I will be at work, is it possible to schedule these lessons after working hours
13/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I can completely understand your concern dear parent. Since, Primrose is in school, we have decided to only take the basic training wih you and then we can put her program on hold.
13/10/23, 3:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: And let me tell you that Primrose will not miss out on any learning. 
I will ensure that I start her discussions exactly from I left off.
13/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Thank you very much
18/10/23, 2:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Primrose
I hope you are doing really well.

I am aware of the ongoing examination, and I wish you all the very best for the same. 
I would like to remind you that I have already shared the  procedure through which we will be able to put your EWYL Program on hold and then we will resume it once your examinations will get over.

19/10/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *you* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.

Thank you so much sharing the screenshot of the email sent.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Primrose and parents! 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Good afternoon. Its my first time to here about this festival. If your time permits, you can shed more light thank you?
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Sure Primrose, Let me tell you more about the festival.
26/10/23, 4:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Certainly! Dussehra is a big Indian festival that's all about good defeating evil. It celebrates the victory of a prince named Rama over a demon king called Ravana. Rama rescued his wife Sita with the help of his friends and a special bow. People light up fireworks and have parades to mark this happy day.

But Dussehra is not just about a story; it's also a time for family, fun, and food. People dress up in colorful clothes, visit fairs, and enjoy yummy sweets. They also exchange gifts and greetings. The festival lasts for ten days, and on the final day, giant effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhakarna, and son Meghnad are burned with fireworks, symbolizing the victory of good over evil in a grand way.

And the best part? Dussehra teaches us some important life lessons. It reminds us that no matter how powerful evil may seem, goodness and truth always win in the end. It encourages us to be brave and stand up against injustice. The festival also promotes unity and togetherness as people from different backgrounds come together to celebrate. It's a time to forgive and forget, mending relationships and starting anew.

So, it's like a mix of a thrilling story, delicious treats, and lots of celebrations, all while sharing meaningful messages about courage, unity, and the triumph of good values in life. 🌟🤝🕊️🎆🎁🍬
26/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Well understood. Its a wonderful day on your calendar.
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you so much for your kind words!
27/10/23, 12:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon
I hope you are doing well

It is completely alright.
27/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Afternoon Ms Sharda how is the weather like in India. This side its tooo hot, in some areas temperatures are rising to 40 degrees
27/10/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It was hot in here too. But it's the beginning of winters here in India.
31/10/23, 5:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings dear parents and Primrose

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.
31/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 305 0093: Greetings Mrs Sharda. Primrose is currently locked  up in her exams. I think it will be in the best of her interest if we wait for her to respond to this question.
31/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 305 0093: However I will try to get in touch with her teachers so that she has access to a device to be able to respond

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

07/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 305 0093: I think to succeed in EWYL, you need self motivation and dedication to every given task
07/11/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Absolutely, your insight is spot on. Self-motivation and unwavering dedication are key ingredients for success in Earn While You Learn. They drive you to excel in your tasks and make the most of this valuable opportunity. Keep up the great work!
17/11/23, 10:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings to Primrose and parents! 
Hope you are doing well.
