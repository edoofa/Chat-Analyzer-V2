The good news is that Ms. Sharda your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
04/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
