08/09/23, 11:28 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
So, may I know what fascinated you about pursuing a course and career in journalism?
08/09/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 581 9684: What fascinated me is the fact that I have realized that a number of people have got stories that are always untold because they have no access to showcase the talents and stories they have as individuals 

I decided to bring forth hope  to those who have nowhere to share their experiences and stories,therefore becoming a journalist can help me discover certain societal issues which I can address or rather inform the others on


My uncle who is a journalist from a tv channel zbc also inspires me
08/09/23, 11:37 am - Kunal: I see you are well motivated towards this career path and looking forward to excelling in it.
So, do you have any past experiences or learnings in this field specifically?
08/09/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 581 9684: I do not have any Sir
08/09/23, 11:39 am - Kunal: That is fine

A picture would be better
08/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 581 9684: I only have the results of form 6 third term and the O level results

08/09/23, 11:47 am - Kunal: That is fine
08/09/23, 11:48 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them. 
I would also like to inform you that the minimum academic requirement was Six to Nine points at A level. But due to the pandemic, many students failed to access enough for resources and study materials, due to which many couldn't reach the level they were expecting. Therefore, after the evaluations, the requirement has been revised to a minimum of two A-level passes(2 points)

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 11:50 am - +263 78 581 9684: Okay sir I understand

As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
08/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I have no idea sir
08/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/09/23, 2:10 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes sir it is affordable
08/09/23, 2:13 pm - Kunal: Good to know
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Wow this is great news, I do not know how it is done but I will be very  glad to know sir
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: *Webinars: -*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
08/09/23, 2:15 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Thank you so much
08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes sir , thank you
08/09/23, 2:23 pm - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
08/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Wow this is amazing
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: Indeed it is
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
08/09/23, 2:28 pm - Kunal: After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
08/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I like the third one 
Because it helps me to assist my parents in the payment of fees and also send them money to help sustain their needs
08/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and employability.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

08/09/23, 2:33 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 581 9684: My parents will be assisting me with the remaining fee
08/09/23, 2:36 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 581 9684: My family is very happy because I can manage to achieve an international degree which means I can work in any country. It is also beneficial as I can become more independent
08/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 581 9684: My parents are also happy as I can get to interact with new people and learn more about different cultures and languages
08/09/23, 2:42 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
08/09/23, 2:42 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
08/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Knowledge of the English language as it is the most commonly spoken language and of course the ones you have labelled above
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Thank you so much for informing me
08/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
08/09/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Okay thank you sir
08/09/23, 2:51 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I have done stage 1 and stage 2 sir
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Yes please
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
08/09/23, 2:55 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
08/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I am sir , thank you so much
08/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
08/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
08/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kunal: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

Furthermore, if you have any other query I would suggest that you note down all of the questions and get back to me

Happy Family Discussion
Stay Blessed!
08/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 581 9684: Thank you so much sir , it is  a pleasure working with you
08/09/23, 3:32 pm - +27 84 466 8510: Thank you for your time .
09/09/23, 12:44 pm - Austin: I also appreciate your support for her career
09/09/23, 12:45 pm - Austin: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
09/09/23, 12:52 pm - +27 84 466 8510: I think fees is fair and affordable and I'm also glad that she can be able to work and pay part of the school fees and I pay the remaining balance or amount
09/09/23, 1:07 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness to invest in Rutendo's career

So in the counselling session, we discussed the importance of Application forms, SOP, and then we have University Sessions, the Earn While You Learn Program, visa assistance, and all services for which the cost is cut down making the enrollment fee reduced to $350 which can be paid either in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining $150 in 30 days) or together

If she is found eligible for the program, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within 7 days after receiving the Acceptance Letter?
09/09/23, 1:09 pm - +27 84 466 8510: I will be able to pay 200 then 150 after  30days if it's OK with the school
09/09/23, 1:10 pm - +27 84 466 8510: I mean in 30days
09/09/23, 1:27 pm - Austin: Sure, that would be fine
09/09/23, 1:28 pm - Austin: Is there anything you would like to ask me before we begin the eligibility check stage?
09/09/23, 1:30 pm - +27 84 466 8510: No, thank  you sir
09/09/23, 1:32 pm - Austin: So Rutendo, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
09/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 581 9684: I will be studying BA in  journalism and mass communication 

In India

It is around 6000-8000

It is 2000 to 3000

It's 350 and it should be paid within 7 days

I understood that it is whereby the students from eddofa  are given a chance to have online projects linked with different companies whereby they can achieve certain credits which will assist them in payment of their fees , these credits are given based on one's performance, this also has an advantage as students can manage to earn skills and knowledge which they can be able to apply in their career, the earn while u learn is beneficial as it also assist the parents in the payment of fees which reduces stress and pressure for them...the earn  while you learn also deal with recruitment partners whereby Edoofian can manage to acquire jobs after their programs which is a great advantage
