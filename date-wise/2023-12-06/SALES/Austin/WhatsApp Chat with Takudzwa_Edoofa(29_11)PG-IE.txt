29/11/23, 3:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Makama
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident for Takudzwa about achieving it
29/11/23, 3:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
29/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 71 727 9726: I am confident that Takudzwa will be able to pass his A level and meet the minimum requirements for the scholarship.


I haven't started the application to Universities abroad and I cherish this opportunity of a scholarship program because without a scholarship, it's extremely difficult to raise university fees abroad
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 727 9726: Thank you, thank you for the important insights regarding differences between universities abroad and this scholarship program
29/11/23, 4:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You're most welcome mam
29/11/23, 4:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering Takudzwa's subjects, interests, and passion, he is eligible to pursue

29/11/23, 4:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me 

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?

2)How do you aim to make sure that your child achieves your child's career aspirations from studying in India?
29/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 71 727 9726: 1. Global recognition of the qualifications has a positive impact. Turning my son into a global leader through immense expertise is commendable


I will do everything to support my son to study in india so he can achieve his career objectives
29/11/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I appreciate the efforts that you are putting for your child's career.
29/11/23, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Makamba, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
29/11/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 727 9726: I am not aware of the expenses without a scholarship
29/11/23, 5:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/11/23, 5:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 5:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
29/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 727 9726: Looking at the reduced fees and also considering the earn while you learn program, it's affordable
29/11/23, 5:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
29/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 727 9726: I would like to embrace the opportunity to earn while studying for my son but l don't know how this is done
29/11/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Ms. Makamba, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

29/11/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
29/11/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 727 9726: I would like my son to benefit from the earn while you learn program apart from reducing living expenses, it gives an opportunity to mingle with prospective employer s which is very important to the young man as it also gives him exposure
29/11/23, 5:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
29/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 727 9726: So even after getting the scholarship, we still have to sponsor the graduate
29/11/23, 5:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Makamaba, can you please elaborate this to me?
29/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 727 9726: I am taking from the fact that you said monthly sponsorship of between $90 to $100 a month, now my question is, even if you are on a scholarship will you need some cushioning from home
29/11/23, 5:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Makamba, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
29/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 71 727 9726: Depending on the actual amounts of the remaining expenses , l can only tell if l know the amounts involved however I am willing to give my son an opportunity
29/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 71 727 9726: So basically the most important question for me would be how much is the cost living and transportation on average so l can be guided accordingly
29/11/23, 7:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in response as I was having my dinner.
29/11/23, 7:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I will be guiding you regarding the same in the further session, Ms. Makamba.
29/11/23, 7:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
29/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 71 727 9726: It is well, thanks
29/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 727 9726: Point 2, Affordability through guaranteed scholarship: This is more appealing and important to me because without the relief which comes from the scholarship program, my son will never be able to get through the tertiary education in India considering the costs where there is no scholarship
29/11/23, 8:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures.

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

29/11/23, 8:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly, Ms. Makamba

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 727 9726: We are very excited and looking forward to it. It will be great hearing experiences of those that have gone through the processes

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
30/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 727 9726: Sure, let's start
30/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 727 9726: True, if you put in some effort, life will meet you halfway
30/11/23, 8:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's so true, Ms. Makamba.
30/11/23, 8:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Takudzwa's career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his  family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents.
30/11/23, 8:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
30/11/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 727 9726: Precisely so
30/11/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 727 9726: In terms of employment, what will happen after completion of studies
30/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 727 9726: Is the boy assured of getting employment in a high paying environment and where is that? In Zimbabwe we have a challenge of high unemployment rate even to those who are educated they're not employed as well
30/11/23, 9:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Makamba, BALLB degree enhances job prospects in the legal field, job security and high-paying positions depend on various factors, including individual skills, market conditions, and economic factors. It's advisable to approach post-graduate prospects with optimism but also a realistic understanding of the competitive nature of the job market. Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws (BALLB) program can significantly enhance your qualifications and open up various career opportunities, it's important to note that employment outcomes can vary based on factors such as individual skills, networking, and the overall economic conditions of a region.

So, It's crucial for individuals to actively participate in internships, gain practical experience, and build a strong professional network to enhance their employability.
30/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 727 9726: Noted with thanks
30/11/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Makamba, Also, note that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
30/11/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
30/11/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
30/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 727 9726: Please go ahead
30/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 727 9726: This message was deleted
30/11/23, 9:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
30/11/23, 9:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
30/11/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 727 9726: Understood
30/11/23, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/11/23, 9:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

30/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 727 9726: Now you're proceeding to 4
30/11/23, 9:43 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
30/11/23, 9:46 am - +263 71 727 9726: Sure
30/11/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
30/11/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
30/11/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

30/11/23, 10:13 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Makamba, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

01/12/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 727 9726: No questions at the moment. I realized that the Edoofa Scholarship program is quite helpful for the African child considering the economic hardships that we are currently facing in raising tertiary fees

01/12/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 727 9726: Sure, it's a rare privilege and opportunity for the youth
01/12/23, 8:32 pm - Austin: I was evaluating Takudzwa's application and noticed that he is from St Francis Xavier's Kutama which is very familiar to me.
01/12/23, 8:32 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:32 pm - Austin: *A total of 370+ Edoofians from Zimbabwe were welcomed at the airport by our Edoofa team for this year's intake*. The numerous testimonials from countless students serve as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of this opportunity in enhancing students' employability skills, and overall education quality. Let me proudly inform you that we have *Nicassio Simbarashe Chanda, a former student of St Xavier's Kutuma College who arrived recently for the intake*.
01/12/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 727 9726: Yes ,  Takudzwa has been at Kutama for the past 6 years
01/12/23, 8:34 pm - Austin: Nicassio is my student here in India and today is his birthday, I wished him in the morning and Takudzwa's application reminded me that they are from the same school.
01/12/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 727 9726: Wooow it's good to hear about the former Kutama student, l am sure you will agree with me that the boys from Kutama are a cut above the rest and well groomed
01/12/23, 8:39 pm - Austin: No doubt in that, Nicassio proved that right from the day of his interview and is a proud Edoofian today performing well in the program. I look forward to Takudzwa as well giving his best to grab this opportunity.
01/12/23, 8:39 pm - Austin: May I also know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
01/12/23, 8:42 pm - +263 71 727 9726: If l remember well, the enrollment fees is pegged at $350, and annual fees plus or minus $2000. Since it's not a once off payment it seems to be reasonable
01/12/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 727 9726: What l am not sure of is the monthly provisions, accommodation, and transport
01/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 727 9726: I also wanted to find out what happens to Edoofa graduates after graduating, do they come back to Zimbabwe for employment or they get absorbed there by the Indian system
01/12/23, 8:46 pm - Austin: You are right about the enrollment fee, the cost of education per annum ranges $2000-$3000

This cost of education can be paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. Else, students can open an Indian bank account to which you can make monthly installments and students can pay it together before a semester. This cost of education includes tuition fees, *Accommodation*, Food, Wifi. laundry. library fee etc
01/12/23, 8:46 pm - Austin: The cost of transportation, stationaries, gadgets and any personal needs are catered by the student's family.
01/12/23, 8:48 pm - Austin: If students are looking forward to working in India, they can begin their career with an attachment after which the organization can help in converting their student visa to work visa. Otherwise, there are campus hirings through which the students can be employed in India or abroad.
01/12/23, 8:48 pm - Austin: After graduation, students will have the liberty to choose their career. They can either work in India or abroad, pursue higher education in India or abroad or return to Zimbabwe.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

It is agreeable that Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient however totally agreeing on the above statement leads to a biased analysis since poor diets in Africa are also due to sanctions imposed by the European countries and the poor currency in most of African Countries .

To commence with ,Africa can not feed itself unless the outside world help with money and technology to spur Agriculture across the continent .Therefore it is true tha Africans have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient since they lack agriculture development and food security .

Equally important ,low fertility soils,environmental degradation and poor infrastructure have greatly affected Africa's efforts to develop the farms and hence they are stagnant and inefficient which leads to poor diets .

However ,sanctions such as imposed by some of the European nations  have caused African to lag behind economically which leads to poor diets whereas some people actually survive on hand to mouth and can to afford to bring bread and butter to their tables .

To supplement the above paragraph ,most of African countrie's currency only work in those countries which becomes difficult for the to trade when the is no the international currence which therefore leads to poor diets .

All things considered ,Africans have poor diets due to a number of things such as sanctions and poor currency but the fact that  farms are stagnant and inefficient is soo alarming that it can not be ignored .
