19/11/23, 1:53 am - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh l started my primary level at Sasula primary and later on transferred to Ganyungu primary where l wrote my grade 7 and got 10 units. L then proceeded to highschool level and started at Gwamure high where l managed to prosper in chess, debate and public speaking. Later on l transferred to Ngomayebani Sec in search of science subjects and that's where l wrote my O level and l passed 10 subjects out of 11. L then l proceeded to A level at Chrome high school, where l got 6 points in sciences i.e last year '2022'. 
So uh my field of interest is engineering and l want either aerospace engineering or mining engineering and my hobbies are playing chess or reading novels. 
My father is a teacher and my mother is not employed. So uh we are five in our family i.e our parents, me and my two elder sisters. Where we stayed was usually determined by where our father would be at that time until now we are living in Zvishavane Mapirimira in rural areas.

21/11/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh the first thing is that uh this program doesn't just take students simply because they are poor or needy but because of their attitude and talent. Furthermore, this program has advantages like making a student earn while learning, dominance of englidh so that everyone gets to communicate easier  , also if a student wants to study in other countries, Edoofa will ensure that it assists with necessary knowledge and give you the best career advice. You can also get to earn scholarship credits by working after college hours by doing internet based internships and tasks.

21/11/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What is the cost of Education abroad ?
21/11/23, 9:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?

22/11/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 557 0270: How are you today sir
22/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Uh...I'm not quite aware
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh l have made some research... countries like Germany, Norway, Argentina, India and Poland usually ranges between £2500 - £6000 per year
22/11/23, 2:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @263775570270 Did you manage to go through this document ?
22/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course I did ...l thought you just meant like in general... costs on this document l saw them
22/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh my battery is out but I'm sure l will be back online soon
22/11/23, 5:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So have you gone through the cost of Education abroad ?
22/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Yes l did
22/11/23, 8:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please share it with me ?
22/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh in India the average cost is $6000 -$8000 per year but because  of Edoofa program and due to its  $10 million scholarship fund, it can decrease up to $2000 - 3000 per year and that's why this program is considered the best because in countries like Germany, expenses ranges from $10 000 -$ 12 000 per year and for English taught courses, it's  $20 000 - $25 000. Also in China it's $6000 - $9000, so the way l see it , Edoofa has made it easier for students to live and study in India.
23/11/23, 11:55 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

23/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh  my father is the one who's been financially supporting me and he's a teacher at Govarizadze secondary.My school once charged us 50 Us per term
23/11/23, 9:26 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Alright uh let me say l have great plans of changing the future for my country mainly in aeroplanes and mining area because the way l see it, my country is full of minerals but because of lack of advanced machinery we don't get to access those minerals and even on aeroplanes side, l also have a plan to open schools and industries of manufacturing aeroplanes so without me going abroad to access advanced technology and efficient knowledge, l won't be able to bring any of these visions to life unless l go abroad

24/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Ok uh the first thing is that all papers licked especially maths and chemistry, so if your answers looked familiar with those of marking schemes which had licked, you were penalized even if your school wasn't on the list of schools which had licked exams but also the issue that our physics teacher transferred when we were in form 6 so we had to finish the syllabus on our own, so basically that's what affected our stream.
24/11/23, 4:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: \These are your final results?
24/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 557 0270: Of course
