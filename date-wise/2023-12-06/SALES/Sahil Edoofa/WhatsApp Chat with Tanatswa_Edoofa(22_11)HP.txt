We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd.

22/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 443 4824: Hello am Tanatswa’s Dad. Thanks for the detailed background information. Much appreciated. May be you can now kindly share information on the enrollment modalities and any relevant details related to the program
22/11/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Dr George!

22/11/23, 2:49 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mrs Tafadzwa and Dr George, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
22/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 443 4824: Thank you. I am an Urban Specialist and have a Doctoral Degree in Development Studies. Motivation - to help her as best as we can to fulfill her educational and career dreams.
22/11/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: Well received please, Its a pleasure to know about you!

I appreciate your thoughts on supporting her!
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 902 9449: I am a Pharmacist. I am a holder of a Bachelor of Pharmacy Honours degree . My dream is to see Tanatswa pursuing her tertiary studies and I intend to give her all the support she requires
22/11/23, 4:03 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Mrs Tafadzwa!

It's a pleasure to know you better.
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: So, I would like to know about Tanatswa please!

How she is at school, her interests and hobbies, along with anything that you would like to share about her?

Do share what she would like to study and the subjects in A level.
22/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Tanatswa is currently studying for her  Cambridge A levels. She recently sat for her  AS level exams and results will be coming out in January. Her subjects are Econonmics , Business studies and Geography. She wishes to study Marketing,  Business Management or Human resources Management at University level. She has a great passion for sport and she does athletics  and Girls' soccer
22/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful and well expressed, Mrs Tafadzwa.

It's a pleasure to know more about her.
22/11/23, 5:48 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
22/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Considering the amount of work she is putting in towards her studies , I'm very confident that she will attain at least 7 points. We will also be giving her the necessary support to ensure that she performs well
22/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Mrs Tafadzwa!

22/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Sure, I had that question in mind. I'm not very familiar with Indian tertiary education and would want more information. Are the Universities reputable worldwide and do they offer programs that can be recognised worldwide?
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Mrs Tafadzwa.

The universities are reputable worldwide and the degrees are recognised internationally as well.
22/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

22/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over and it's already been a long day, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
22/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians.
22/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Thank you so much Ms Harmehak.  Let me thoroughly go through the information you sent and then we can take it from there. I would want to know more on the application process and also about the scholarships
22/11/23, 11:02 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Thank you so much for your valuable time Ms Harmehak. We will certainly post questions on areas that we need clarity on.
22/11/23, 11:02 pm - +263 71 902 9449: I've gone through the material you sent , as well as the videos you posted. Very informative indeed. However I have a few questions on my part.

1. Considering the subjects that Tanatswa  is undertaking at A level and the program that she intends to do at University, ( We can work with BBA for now since it suits her intentions) how easy is it  for her to get a scholarship that funds BBA?

2. Is it easy to get a 100% fully funded scholarship in your first year. In the video I picked out that some students were eventually capable of paying for their own tuition.  Does it mean it's easy for students to get part time employment and can this sustain them throughout their studies.  Also in the event that a student does not get a 100% scholarship, roughly how expensive is the shortfall that us parents must pay. I'm sure this applies to tuition only.

3. How expensive is accommodation and general upkeep expenses and can these be partly covered by scholarships or us parents have to meet  these expenses?

4. How easy is it for Black Africans to blend into the Indian system and culture? Are there many cases of discrimination against Black Africans? I'm sure we all understand and are aware of how  Black Africans are usually discriminated against globally.
23/11/23, 9:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
23/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 902 9449: Good morning. Yes we can start.
23/11/23, 9:51 am - +263 71 902 9449: I had already compiled  some questions last night , so we can start from there
23/11/23, 9:52 am - Harmehak: Surely I would address them for you please.
23/11/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
23/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 902 9449: Yes, I now understand why you recommend India. And no I'm not aware of the costs of tertiary education for International students who are not on scholarship.
23/11/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Mrs Tafadzwa
23/11/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 11:27 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 11:28 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 6:52 pm - Harmehak: To address your queries please -

1- She surely can score a scholarship for BBA and you would be briefed regarding the same in the later stages as well.

2- I hope you have a better clarity regarding the finances and what we discussed today, along with the same we do have Earn While You Learn Program for our Proud Edoofians.

3- The fees shared include Accomodation, Food, Tuition fee and basic university expenses.

4- Having had the community of over 2000 students none of our students have reported any such case of discrimination, for us our students are our top priority and they are alloted dedicated mentor who are in touch with them throughout.
Students follow their cultures here in India as well and blend in perfectly.

While I completely understand your concerns, once we conclude our discussion tomorrow I would also connect you with a parent who is currently in Zimbabwe and has twin children currently in India!
23/11/23, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Good evening . My sincere apologies,  today was a very busy day. I did manage to go through everything you sent and I am very much interested in having Tanatswa apply for the program. I would also appreciate it very much if you could connect us with the Zim parents. I'm very  satisfied and we can move on to the next stage
23/11/23, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: That's completely alright and I do understand the same.

I appreciate your kind words.

Since we would conclude the stage soon, after the same I would connect you with parents as by then you would be aware of the entire process!
23/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 71 902 9449: I feel 2000 to 3000 per year is quite reasonable and it's a figure we can comfortably work with.  The Earn while you learn program is worth pursuing as well as it will reduce the financial burden on our part
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please, the motive was to assist both parents and students.

Through the program the students learn skills and Eran credits which reduce the financial burden on parents.

Let me share more details.
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 71 902 9449: And it will definitely equip students with skills that they will eventually use after their studies. A very impressive initiative indeed
23/11/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Mrs Tafadzwa.
23/11/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

23/11/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 7:12 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: You can let me know if you have followed so that we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Yes , you can proceed
23/11/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: I hope we are together so far please?
23/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Yes, I'm following. You can proceed
23/11/23, 8:07 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Mrs Tafadzwa, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes only. 

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Yes
23/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 902 9449: You can go ahead
23/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Tafadzwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
23/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 71 902 9449: That would be about 2250 for the 5 applications
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
23/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mrs Tafadzwa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Yes, quite affordable compared to the other route.
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
23/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 902 9449: The fact that the fee covers multiple applications makes it even better
23/11/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to have you acknowledge the same, Mrs Tafadzwa.
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Still following,  you can proceed
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
23/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Yes I've gone through and I understand
23/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
23/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
23/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
23/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Understood
23/11/23, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
23/11/23, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 8:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 902 9449: I would  really appreciate you connecting us with Mrs Magwaza
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Thank you
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Right here is her contact please
23/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome Mrs Tafadzwa
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
24/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 902 9449: Good morning Sahil. Its a pleasure to hear from you. Yes, the session with Ms Harmehak was very enlightening. We can proceed with the eligibility check evaluation. I may take  long to respond as I am occupied,  my apologies in advance. However,  I will be carefully going through  all the messages and will give you responses
24/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 443 4824: Morning thanks, I will also be following the conversations intermittently as am engaged in another meeting
24/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
24/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 902 9449: We had an informative session and she also managed to answer all of our questions well
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
24/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 902 9449: I've contacted her via WhatsApp messaging. I still need to call her for a detailed conversation

27/11/23, 12:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

28/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 443 4824: Hello apologies due to work commitments is it possible to have flexibility and have the sessions during lunch hour this side
28/11/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you managed to have a call with her and clear all your questions ?

28/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope all your questions were answered ?
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Meanwhile can you tell me:-

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
