2) During my discussions with Anesu I heard that I would be getting education at India's best universities and also learning theory implementing it in practical activities. He also highleted how you guys are going to link me to world class Indian universities. He also told me that if I'm lucky enough to be an Edoofian, I will secure a scholarship ranging between 50 percent to 100 percent. He also put emphasis on a very valuable component of your program called the Earn While You Learn Program where I get to come in handy, acquire 21st century business skills so that I can get highly employable at the same time earn some scholarship credits. <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
22/11/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program

22/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Yes I do have past experience of learning in the field of accounts <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - Arshita: Please share about that
22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I have been taking Accounts as a high school subject since Form 1 and I managed to sit for the national zimsec o level accounting exam last year where I passed with flying colours and hence the desire to pursue it still during my A level
22/11/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: That is well noted. 

To take your evaluation forward can you please share your O level and term results of form 5? 

Pictures will be better
22/11/23, 12:47 pm - +263 71 852 4346: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 1:00 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing. 

Please share term results of form 5 also.
22/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 306 3101: Im folow in
22/11/23, 1:08 pm - Arshita: Please share
22/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 852 4346: We submitted our report books last weeks so I just have to see my class teacher to get it....I'll send the results through in due course, latest 3 pm

Can you please confirm me your subjects in form 5?
22/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Maths, Economics, Accounting and Business studies
22/11/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
22/11/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
22/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I'm very confident.
22/11/23, 2:02 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
22/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 852 4346: No i didn't this is my first time
22/11/23, 2:21 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

22/11/23, 3:11 pm - Arshita: Makona, to become a CA you need to give a special exam and BCOM provides you with the foundation of the same as the curriculum is the same. 

Along with Bcom you can prepare for the CA entrance exam. 

All my students have been doing both together.
22/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I see myself five years from now as a successful professional with a strong foundation in the principles of commerce and finance. I believe that earning a bachelor's degree in commerce will give me the skills and knowledge I need to succeed in the business world. I'm especially interested in pursuing a career as a chartered accountant, and I believe that this degree will give me the tools I need to be successful in this field.
22/11/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career.I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.
 
So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform

22/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Ooh okay, I understand now. Thank you for the clarity.
22/11/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I know that India has quite a number of world class universities that are internationally acclaimed. I also know that Indian Universities are actually taking the lead in fields such  as Medicine and Technology and also doing well in commercials. I also know that some of the world's leading CEOs like Ambani are from India and also, India is the biggest English Speaking country in the world. <This message was edited>
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding.
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.

22/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Wow. This is amazing....I didn't know India was this bigger a player when it comes to education.  I'm really looking forward to be part of this challenging community where I'll be exposed to stiff competition 🙂
22/11/23, 3:31 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
22/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Studying in India would give me the opportunity to gain exposure to a wide range of industries and learn about the financial regulations and practices that are specific to the country. Additionally, many global accounting firms have offices in India, which could provide me with opportunities to gain experience working with clients from around the world for example Kpmg. Overall, studying in India could give me a unique perspective on the field of accounting, as well as valuable experience.
22/11/23, 3:41 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
22/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 852 4346: No, apprise me please.
22/11/23, 3:42 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 3:42 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:42 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Yes I feel like this is affordable I will have to consult my parents on their opinion
22/11/23, 3:53 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 852 4346: No
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.

22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
22/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I think I will be benefiting from the earn while you learn program because it would provide me with hands-on experience in  chosen field of study, which can help me to build my skills and make connections in the chosen industry so that it would easier when searching for  employment after graduating.....and I also think the program will make my education much more affordable.
22/11/23, 4:14 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
22/11/23, 4:14 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I understand. This is very beneficial on our part. Thank you.
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
22/11/23, 4:20 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
22/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I like most  the first fact which states that expert career counselling which enables me to access reliable information at the correct time which would assists us as students in our career growth in all respects
22/11/23, 4:31 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

22/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 71 852 4346: That's awesome I hope someday I will be part of this beneficial programme
22/11/23, 4:38 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
22/11/23, 4:47 pm - +263 71 852 4346: My parents
22/11/23, 4:47 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
22/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 852 4346: They're very happy about it. It's been their dream of a lifetime
22/11/23, 4:49 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
22/11/23, 4:49 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
22/11/23, 4:49 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
22/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 852 4346: I also think a student visa is required
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:52 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
22/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Yes, yes go on.
22/11/23, 5:04 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
22/11/23, 5:04 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 5:19 pm - +263 71 852 4346: So what is total amount required for the edoofa application fee
22/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: $350 is the enrollment fee
22/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
22/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Okay thanks now I understand
22/11/23, 5:26 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 5:36 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
22/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 852 4346: We have done stage 1
22/11/23, 5:37 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
22/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Yes
22/11/23, 5:41 pm - Arshita: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
22/11/23, 5:41 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
22/11/23, 5:41 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
22/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Yes I am thank you
22/11/23, 7:45 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

How is your day progressing?
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 71 852 4346: Actually they were in support of this very helpful programme as it would expose me to the outside world. At first, they were worried that this programme might not be legit.....they were just being prudent you know, they're a lot of scammers nowadays, but through the counselling session we had yesterday and also through accessing Edoofa websites and youtube feeds, they were now in light  and were now interested as they realised I would be gaining work experience  whilst learning also. All I can say is they're now content and looking forward to do whatever it takes for me to be part of this great journey.
23/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 306 3101: Very well sir

25/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 306 3101: Ok so do you me an per annum we  are targeted to pay a maximum amount   of 1800 and the rest  by the scholarship
25/11/23, 6:51 pm - Austin: Yes you can
25/11/23, 6:51 pm - Austin: That is correct, Tanaka
25/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 306 3101: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 6:57 pm - Austin: The registration fee is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $1700 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $1700-600= $1100
