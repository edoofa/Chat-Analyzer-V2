What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? :.  I have learnt that Edoofa program is a link between African children to better education in India. It is partially funded(school fees) and relatively affordable to some. Edoofa program is focuses on the betterment of African lives by providing African children with unlimited exposure to the world that is not confined to Africa. The program wants to uplift Africans using their children and to attain that objective,they saw it fit to provide partial funding for the students so that tertiary education will not be too expensive and relatively cheaper thereby  increasing it's available and accessibility to most Africans. Hence the EWYL program was put into practice,this will be of assistance to some of the students to earn money whilst learning which may be used to pay the remaining school fees and other expenses. It also leads to accessibility of scholarship credits hence one can pay the equivalent amount to that being paid in cash by another individual. All in all, Edoofa program helps to reducing the financial burden of parents when paying for tertiary education for their children.

How are you doing?
21/11/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 294 9349: Iam good how are you
21/11/23, 11:45 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
21/11/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Umhh ma'am,I'm still online and waiting for the session to begin
21/11/23, 3:36 pm - Arshita: Makaita, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me: 

1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Anna?*
21/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 871 0042: 1) The financial problems in the family and my desire to study further drove me to search for means to attain that objective and that's when I saw your foundation being mentioned... The fact that you focus mostly on African children gave me hope that I will be accepted. The racial diversity at your foundation was my center of attraction because you have assisted alot of children from different walks of life and in cooperating them in your lives in India made me feel like I will find acceptance in your foundation
21/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 871 0042: 2)  Anna told me alot of things about EDOOFA and I will try to summary as much as possible. Edoofa program helps African children with access to education in India by providing financial aid. It has EWYL program that enables students to learn whist doing a paying job that will also assist them in paying their school fees and meet other expenses. The foundation also helps to cover accommodation costs of the students. It also provides scholarship credits hence a student can pay the same amount of fees that's being paid by those paying in cash hence reduced burden of interest on credit <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.

Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

21/11/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
21/11/23, 4:24 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
21/11/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I am confident and with all the hard work that I have put in then luck ought to be in my favour
21/11/23, 4:27 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
21/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I researched about Gulzar group of Institutes
21/11/23, 4:32 pm - Arshita: Have you applied there?
21/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I haven't, just weighing my options and finding out their expectations <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
21/11/23, 4:35 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
21/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Indian educational system,it is more theory based whereas foreign education systems are predominantly practical based and this helps students to know the basis of something before arriving to a decision to act on. It is based on the centralized curriculum that is prescribed by the respective boards of education thereby leaving little room for customisation or personalisation of courses,and students have limited choices in terms of the courses but it gives a sense of direction and reduces mistakes of choosing the wrong course to undertake that may threaten the success of the student <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: Let me also show you some facts about India and global leaders who are the product of Indian Education.
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:03 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I am done reading ma'am
21/11/23, 5:08 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
21/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 871 0042: India is part of the common wealth hence more opportunities in the foreign labour  markets because India is highly recommended .
Studying in India will make it easy for me to obtain a job due to its flourishing educational facilities
21/11/23, 5:12 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
21/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 78 871 0042: No
21/11/23, 5:14 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/11/23, 5:14 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:15 pm - Arshita: In simple words Makaita what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/11/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 871 0042: That is really nice of you
21/11/23, 5:18 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
21/11/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 871 0042: No, please tell me
21/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
21/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
21/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
21/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

21/11/23, 5:19 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
21/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 294 9349: I wish my daughter could be part of the Edoofa family after reading all the information you have sent so
21/11/23, 5:24 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes and I would love to be a part of it ,as you stated before,some students may fail to pay the fees and I want to avoid that being a possibility therefore this could be my way to do so
21/11/23, 5:24 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
21/11/23, 5:25 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes I do
21/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 871 0042: And it is a fascinating means to increase a student's skills yet reducing their costs
21/11/23, 5:30 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
21/11/23, 5:30 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
21/11/23, 5:30 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
21/11/23, 5:30 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
21/11/23, 5:30 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
21/11/23, 5:30 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
21/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Earn while you learn
21/11/23, 5:32 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

21/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Ok
21/11/23, 5:35 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
21/11/23, 5:35 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I will try to maximize my gain
21/11/23, 5:35 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
21/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 871 0042: My parents
21/11/23, 5:36 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
21/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 871 0042: They are happy and excited
21/11/23, 5:37 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
21/11/23, 5:37 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
21/11/23, 5:37 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 871 0042: And I would love that to happen
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
21/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes I think so too
21/11/23, 5:39 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
21/11/23, 5:39 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes
21/11/23, 5:40 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
21/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Wow that's awesome,can't wait to be an Edoofian if you allow
21/11/23, 5:43 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 871 0042: 01
21/11/23, 5:47 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
21/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes
21/11/23, 5:48 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
21/11/23, 5:48 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
21/11/23, 5:48 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
21/11/23, 5:48 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
21/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 871 0042: It's clear <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 7:27 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
21/11/23, 7:27 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

Are you ready for the same?
22/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes I am and greetings to you too
22/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Greetings to Mr Austin
22/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Iam ready
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Mr mudavanhu is held up at work
22/11/23, 3:23 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mrs Mudavanhu and Makaita,

I hope you are doing well
22/11/23, 3:24 pm - Austin: This is well noted
22/11/23, 3:24 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
22/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 294 9349: It gives opportunities to poor children from all walks of life to achieve their ambitions
22/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Provides a link between African children and abroad schools,this will make their quality of education better whilst paying relatively affordable fees  due to the partial funding by the organization
22/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 294 9349: No questions
22/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I don't have any questions to ask
22/11/23, 3:28 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
22/11/23, 3:29 pm - Austin: May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
22/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 294 9349: They are fair to me as a low income earner
22/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I feel like they make it easy for my parents to afford my tertiary education reducing my chances of not going to tertiary school
22/11/23, 3:36 pm - Austin: This is well noted,Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
22/11/23, 3:36 pm - Austin: @263772949349 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
22/11/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Yes I am
22/11/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 294 9349: That's true
22/11/23, 3:40 pm - Austin: Noted Mrs Mudavanhu
22/11/23, 3:41 pm - Austin: So,Makaita before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While you Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
22/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 871 0042: 1) Bachelor of commerce
2)India
3)$5000-$6000
4)$2000-$3000
5)$350 in 7days
6) EWYL program helps students to pay their remaining balances after provision of the scholarship by offering them a job and the more they work,the more they earn thus greater fees being paid. EWYL program gives access to scholarship credit,this enables the parents/guardians to pay the same amount as that being paid in cash by another student. It helps the student to learn and develop the skills that are necessary for the digital workspace environment such as Research.
7) Yes I am
22/11/23, 3:51 pm - Austin: Good Work, Makaita!
22/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Thank you
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:52 pm - Austin: Dear parents @263772949349 @263772455997 ,Before we proceed, it is important that you are on the same page and fully support this path in your child's career! Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?*. Your acknowledgement is mandatory to proceed and do not hesitate to share if you have any challenges.
22/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 294 9349: It all depends on the date and time if it's during mid December we will be able to pay within 7 days but any day before that payment plan will be the most appropriate one
22/11/23, 4:01 pm - Austin: If we begin the eligibility check process for Makaita tomorrow, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies, the due date for the first part($200) will fall towards this month's end. Do you feel it is feasible for you?
22/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 294 9349: In deed we will be able to pay on or before the due date
22/11/23, 4:04 pm - Austin: This is well noted and I appreciate your support for your child's career!
22/11/23, 4:04 pm - Austin: Makaita, The most important process of your eligibility check stage is your scholarship interview with the Program Director at Edoofa. Shall I share the schedule for the same?
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes please

24/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 294 9349: So far so good sir
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 245 5997: It a happy time.
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, we are really glad that Makaita qualified for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. We look forward to her as a proud Edoofian fulfilling her career goals through this opportunity.
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - Austin: I am happy to hear this!
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Austin: Great, are you all having any questions for me regarding the Acceptance Letter?
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 245 5997: Diet. Do you cater to students who are not into very spicey food?
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 294 9349: What will she be doing doing during the EWYL program
24/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Where will she be doing her practices
24/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Approximately how much is the visa and flight ticket
24/11/23, 3:18 pm - Austin: Please note that the cost of education that we discussed includes within the range that we discussed. Now, there are multiple options for Diet such as University canteens, kiosks, monthly packages, tiffin services and students can cook at times at their residences. There would be international cuisine in Hostel Campus thereby providing options for students who are not into spicey food
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - Austin: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to research, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly. Students can begin EWYL program after the enrollment from their home country itself

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 245 5997: Well answered.
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Understood
24/11/23, 3:19 pm - Austin: Can you help me further with the question, which practice are you referring to?
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Austin: The visa application fee is $83 and the flight fare is around $450 and can vary depending on the time of booking. Early booking would attract the lowest fares
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Thank you well explained
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 245 5997: Thank you again.
