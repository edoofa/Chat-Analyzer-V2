What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? I learnt that edoofa gives opportunities to those who need it.
Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
 I am a young man who has always had to struggle to get anything in life, that build me. I know my goals, I'm definitely going to chase them and I'll definitely succeed no matter what. I am motivated by the life I live, its not the life I want my mother to live hence I'm going to make it in life no matter how many setbacks I might face. I hope this programme accepts me. Thank you
