05/12/23, 2:06 pm - Arshita: That is fine

To take your evaluation forward can you please share your O level and form 5 results?

05/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 010 0960: Will send the O level ones but unfortunately for Form 5 we submit report books at the end of the course
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - Arshita: Noted.

History.
Family and Religious Studies
05/12/23, 2:11 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
05/12/23, 2:11 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
05/12/23, 2:23 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
05/12/23, 2:27 pm - Arshita: Are we still connected?
05/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 010 0960: Yes we are still connected Ma'am
05/12/23, 3:08 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
05/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 010 0960: Not yet but I'm ready to do so
05/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.
05/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
05/12/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 010 0960: I am done Ma'am
