02/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: Hi Mr.Dondo, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon

05/12/23, 4:27 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Lubelihle, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
