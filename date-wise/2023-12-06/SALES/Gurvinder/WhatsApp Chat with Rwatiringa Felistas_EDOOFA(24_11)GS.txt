05/12/23, 8:45 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
05/12/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 015 6082: Finance issues
05/12/23, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*

While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
05/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: So I would like to know why are you settling for a mediocre education in such an expensive environment.
05/12/23, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: In India the cost of education with us is $2000-$3000 and that includes food, accomodation, and transport.
05/12/23, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: This cost too can be brought down in our program.
05/12/23, 9:20 am - Gurvinder: So just think about it.
05/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 015 6082: OK
05/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 015 6082: Let me think about it
05/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 015 6082: The truth is I made up my mind and I came up with my conclusion that  I don't have to go to university with poor point westing money for 4 years
05/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 015 6082: I have go to collage  or poly
