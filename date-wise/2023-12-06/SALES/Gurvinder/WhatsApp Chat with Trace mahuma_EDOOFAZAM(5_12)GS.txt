*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

05/12/23, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
05/12/23, 8:14 am - +260 97 6752200: What I understand from Edoofa scholarship program is that this is the program that was created to offer students scholarships in other countries and Zambia is one of them far from that Edoofa India provides Education for everyone student who is eligible and also can employ students. 
It helps students in leadership and development also responsible in utilizing the education infrastructure landscape those are some of the things I understand from the program thank you
05/12/23, 8:17 am - +260 97 9973611: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 8:45 am - Gurvinder: That is correct.
05/12/23, 8:45 am - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 8:46 am - +260 97 6752200: Alright sir am willing to hear all what’s about
05/12/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 6752200: I came to learn about edoofa at my school, from one of my teachers and I took keen interest in researching about it. And the turnout and reviews were stunning. 
I learnt that:

Edoofa is an international educational platform that connects students with scholarships for higher education. It aims to make quality education accessible to students globally, providing them with opportunities to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Edoofa utilizes a personalized approach, incorporating mentorship and career guidance to support students throughout their academic journey, and not only that, I but it's also help you get employment because of the huge chances you get of getting educated through them. And I applied and prayed I was given a short. 
Thank you.
05/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 6752200: Yes you are right am actually desperately looking forward to this scholarship so as I can help my vulnerable family and achieve my goals and dreams
05/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 6752200: Am also asking, how do you pick when it comes to results from the final exam
05/12/23, 9:00 am - +260 97 6752200: It’s really a beautiful place
05/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Trace, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 9:22 am - +260 97 6752200: Yes sir and I promise to do my very best, by being active in all counseling sessions till the day we will finish sir thank you
05/12/23, 9:29 am - +260 97 9973611: Hello sir, as a mother am very interested and happy with the EDOOFA Scholarship program bcos if my girl is choose,   it will mean the whole family is going to benefit. May God bless you for coming up with the EDOOFA Scholarship program 🙏🙏
05/12/23, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: That is great.

05/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Trace, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like:
1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*

05/12/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 6752200: Since it requires sciences and Biology and am a bit good in those subjects you can refer to my term two science results they were the highest among all the subjects I took thank you <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.

05/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 9973611: Yes you may please
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.
