02/12/23, 11:00 am - Gurvinder: Hi Innocent, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon
02/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Good afternoon sir , I am discussing with Ms Harmehak  so I could not find a chance to  talk to you both
