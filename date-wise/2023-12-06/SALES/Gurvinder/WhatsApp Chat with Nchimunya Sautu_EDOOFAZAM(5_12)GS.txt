Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 8:53 am - +260 97 8447239: Good morning sir
First and foremost I want to thank you for this opportunity and hoping for more interactions like this soon.
My prior understanding  of what I think about this program is that it is a program that was established to give African girls standard education in India so as help them gain more knowledge and help the community at large.
05/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Dear, it is not just for girls but for anyone who is eligible.
05/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you.
05/12/23, 9:06 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 9:10 am - +260 97 8447239: Yes, very true
05/12/23, 9:11 am - +260 97 8447239: Wow I'm impressed
05/12/23, 9:12 am - +260 97 8447239: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 9:13 am - +260 97 8447239: Thank you for the information
05/12/23, 9:15 am - +260 97 8447239: Is it that before the edoofians go to India you will  visit them in their countries first?
05/12/23, 9:19 am - +260 97 7883184: Very motivating
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Unfortunately before coming to India, they talk to us through online Video calls only, but we make sure to be waiting for them with full excitement at the airport.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Nchimunya, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 9:31 am - +260 97 8447239: Yes sir I strongly believe I can
05/12/23, 9:37 am - +260 97 8447239: What are qualities do u look for to choose an edoofian?
05/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Well Nchimunya, you can surely impress me by being active as most students lose the chance of getting a higher quantam of scholarship due to prolonged counselling sessions where they were not active.
05/12/23, 9:48 am - +260 97 8447239: Okay noted
05/12/23, 9:49 am - +260 97 8447239: Do you also wait for the results to be out?
05/12/23, 9:53 am - +260 97 8447239: Earlier you mentioned something about projects, what projects do you give?
05/12/23, 10:02 am - Gurvinder: Nchimunya, let us be patient and continue with the counselling session.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Your every concern will be addressed ahead.
