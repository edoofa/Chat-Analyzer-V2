01/12/23, 8:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
01/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 141 9711: I will have to see the price first, and see if I can afford
01/12/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 141 9711: Living and transportation you say? At the campus or elsewhere
01/12/23, 8:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Look Tadiwanashe, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
01/12/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 141 9711: Do you pay in installments ?
01/12/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 141 9711: Okay understood

02/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 141 9711: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
02/12/23, 2:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
02/12/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 141 9711: Yes I am
02/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 141 9711: Well I did a little research but I did not apply
02/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 141 9711: Thank you
04/12/23, 12:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!
