So shall we start the session?
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Yes ,, let's proceed with the session.
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That's the spirit! Now being your Counselor, I would like to know you better as a student so please tell me more about yourself. Basically, your educational qualifications, Achievements, the name of your school, your ambitions, your interests and hobbies, your parent's highest qualification and present profession, and a detailed description of your family background.
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Firstly I thank you Counselor for giving me this time so as for me to present  more about myself .Well last year l wrote my O level examinations at Terry Goss High School in Triangle . I managed to score 4 Bs constituting of English, Combined Science , Agriculture ,then our mother language ,2Cs  in Biology and Geography unfortunately last but not least 2 Ds in  Mathematics and Physics.So basically l wrote 8 subjects and managed to get 6 out of the 8 .

As a stunted ant Terry Goss l was enrolled into the prefectural bord in 2022 .l varied out my duties and responsibilities until my ruling term was over and l was awarded with a certificate of leadership as an archiement of one of the best Senior perfects . 

This year 2023  , l enrolled at Terry Goss high school as lower sixth student in the department of Sciences with a combination constituting of Biology ,Crop Science and Geography.
15/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Fortunately during my O level period my best sports or hobbies were athletics fr example relays 4× 100m ,long jump and javelin throw but unfortunately now am more into handball as of when l started my lower sixth grade . 

When l was young l was more interested with aviation industry and wanted to do more with engineering but because of limited resources l found myself  to be more of  agricultural and environmental type of person. 

Unfortunately my background is kind of sometimes a pushback to because sometimes we struggle to find adequate resources. I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters ahead of me , then 2 young sisters . Fortunately some of  my brothers and sisters  managed to be adults but as of  us who are still going to school sometimes because of the econical status school fees ,basic school kits or necessities may become unconsidered. So in other words l am not exposed to such lot of technological advances for study use and that so on is a push back itself .

My father managed to pass his O level and became a teacher fr some time but as of now he is now an operator at a sewage plant in Tongatt Hulett . 

Apart from me and my father  in our family no one has managed to reach O Level and without being said am the first person to proceed to Advanced level of education .The family's demand to basic and important needs like food , clothes and so one sometimes hinders our educational system as sometimes we fail to obtain learning kits like books.
15/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 780 5513: My ambition as a student is to become an Agronomist in the department of the Agricultural sector. Certainly in Triangle Estate  production of sugar from sugarcane is their up most goal and growing up in such an environment l have come tos uch extence that l think it's best we keep on flowing flowing with the already leading business and development favourable to our area. Certainly am sitting for my final A level exams next year but the unfortunate part l worry about is that my even if l manage to score the consider passes ,my family won't be able to afford the next educational level .

 I thank you Counselor

01/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
01/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Certainly,,, unfortunately my previous results were weakest  where l am supposed to be speculating high .Still my ambition is to become an Agronomist however l am still trying to grasp the upper  Level concept and l am sure l will improve as l proceed on .

Zimbabwe itself is an Agrobased economy and I find Agrobased opportunities, businesses more progressive than any other ones  .My ambition, my  motivation is because of this which holds our country's backbone , the bread busket of SADC . Authough at these point of time it may seem impossible or no hope , l just keep on because l know my goal , my destiny  .

To be part of Edoofa to learn more about my career can be a great opportunity to expose me more into great archievements not only for myself but for the community and the country at large .

Here in Zimbabwe Agricultural sector is the most supported project and determination.Rural areas and other communals are based on agriculture to get their source of food and income as well.
01/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Because of being exposed to such environments , l find it beneficial to work with what is already there and keep on modifying it so as to attain more and more products , improving knowledge to the farmers so as the country to produce higher and higher productivities which would fullfil it's needs and let it remain as the well-known breadwinner of the SADZC community

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
04/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Yes am ready
04/12/23, 1:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Hamilton!
04/12/23, 1:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this message?
04/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Certainly ,, as notified above , after my course l see myself being highly qualified and having expertise at the up most level.

04/12/23, 8:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
04/12/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Ummm unfortunately l am not familiar with it
04/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Hamilton! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
04/12/23, 8:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 8:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
04/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Wow
04/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Understood
04/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 780 5513: I think so
04/12/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 780 5513: So is this in USD ?
04/12/23, 9:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Hamilton.
04/12/23, 9:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
04/12/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Ok noted
04/12/23, 9:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Do you have any idea how that's done?
04/12/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Ya it's actually impressive
04/12/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Ummm no
04/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Hamilton. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
04/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
04/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
04/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
04/12/23, 9:16 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Ok understood
04/12/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Yes l think it will be beneficial
04/12/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
04/12/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
04/12/23, 9:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
04/12/23, 9:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

04/12/23, 9:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
04/12/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Understood
04/12/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Ya l clearly understand now
04/12/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
04/12/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/12/23, 9:31 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
04/12/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Well l appreciated a the four ,,l think they are all exceptional
04/12/23, 9:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Hamilton! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Well ,, l think 3 .You see, such an amount to our parents acts as a burden to them so l support the program of EWYL as it reduces the cost of our education
04/12/23, 9:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?

05/12/23, 8:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Success is not a destination; it's a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery." - Brian Tracy*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 780 5513: Morning sir am ready
05/12/23, 8:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Hamilton!
05/12/23, 8:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
05/12/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 780 5513: Well my family supports every move so as for me to acquire knowledge at maximum capacity . Studying abroad is everyone's dream in Africa and on that note , everyone feels proud to have a member of their family that persues education abroad  however the costs are amongst the limiting factors that limit such events from occurring.My family supports the descission 100%
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
05/12/23, 9:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
05/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 780 5513: Ya l guess it is
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
05/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 780 5513: Following
05/12/23, 10:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/12/23, 10:13 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
05/12/23, 7:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
05/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Ya am discussing the costs with my dad
05/12/23, 7:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have concluded the discussion, please?
05/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Not yet
05/12/23, 7:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Hamilton. I will be waiting for your response.
