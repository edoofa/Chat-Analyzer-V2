01/12/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Good afternoon Sir
I'm sorry for replying late there was a problem with the network
01/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 635 0533: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I'm sorry to report that I didn't pass , I'm disappointed in myself, but I'm committed to working hard to improve my grades. I understand that this may affect my scholarship, but I'm willing to discuss this further, if needed.
01/12/23, 6:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
01/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes Sir I'm confident

I will do my best to pass.
01/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I want to assure you that I'm committed to learning from my mistakes and improving my performance in the future.

01/12/23, 6:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
01/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I really appreciate your belief in me
01/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I've always had a passion for engineering, and I'm interested in pursuing a career in this field. 
I've always been fascinated by the way that engineers use science and technology to solve problems.
01/12/23, 7:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since engineering encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
01/12/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Civil engineering 

because it is a fascinating field that involves designing and constructing the infrastructure that keeps our world running for example bridges, roads, and buildings
01/12/23, 9:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards that peculiar domain, please?

*B.Tech Civil*
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

Do you want me to guide you about the course in depth?
05/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, I'd love to learn more about the course.
05/12/23, 11:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: B.Tech Civil
​*B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.

05/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 635 0533: It's interesting to hear about the different industries that civil engineers can work in. I hadn't considered some of those options before. It's good to know that there are a variety of career paths available to me.
05/12/23, 12:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with your career aspirations?
05/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, the course offerings definitely align with my career aspirations. , It's exciting to know that there are so many different possibilities for civil engineers.

Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
05/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes 
That's why I  decided to apply for the Edoofa scholarship
05/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 635 0533: and I will do my best to work hard keeping in mind  that without a scholarship higher education is expensive <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Shalom! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc! <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 5:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
05/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 73 523 5162: Will definitely do our best to pay the reduced fees.
05/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes , my parents will do their best .
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shalom and Mr. Doeswell. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* exclusive Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
05/12/23, 8:02 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, that would be very helpful, I'd love to learn more about the Earn while you learn program .
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Shalom. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
05/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I really appreciate the Webinars and the information they provide. It's great too see how different opportunities can be found in any situation. I think this can be very beneficial.
 The information provided is very encouraging .
05/12/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 635 0533: I'm impressed by the partnerships that Edoofa has created with these companies. It's great to see that there are opportunities for students to find employment after they complete their education.
05/12/23, 9:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2000 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2000, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1000 in the first semester and $1000 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

05/12/23, 9:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
05/12/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 635 0533: Yes, I think the EWYL Program could be a huge help in reducing the financial burden on my parents. It's a great way to earn money and gain valuable experience while still completing my education. I think this program would allow me to make a meaningful contribution to my own education while also supporting my family.
05/12/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
05/12/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
05/12/23, 9:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
