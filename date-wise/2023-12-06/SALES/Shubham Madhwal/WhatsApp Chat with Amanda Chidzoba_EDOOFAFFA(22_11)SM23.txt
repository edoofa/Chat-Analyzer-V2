22/11/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 876 8536: My previous school has helped me to unleash talents that I was afraid to show the world. I was the Events Managing director at my school and with that it taught me how to be responsible and lead with passion. Every event subjected to the school I was the organizer and it was my responsibility to make sure that everything would run smoothly from the finances to pleasing the crowd involved in it. I was also the Club Director of the LIONS INTERNATIONAL LEO CLUB which is abbreviation for Leadership Experience Opportunity. Being part of the Lions family within my school has taught me a lot of skills and has natured me to be a great leader and citizen through helping the vulnerable. I was also the President of The National Institute of Allied Arts at my school, were we participated in Vocal, Art and Literary competitions.

With all this came great responsibility and having to handle all this along with school work taught me time management skills and how to multi task as well.
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e the picture of results for O-Level and Form-5
22/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Sorry sir can I send my results later today, I left my report card at school I have to talk to the school administration first
22/11/23, 1:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, Do you recall your results?
22/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 876 8536: O Level I had 2A's, 3B's and 3C's
22/11/23, 2:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: And what about  for 5?
22/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 876 8536: I didn't write AS I just wrote it combined with A level at once
22/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted,  So can you share with me your A-level Subject combination?
22/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Biology, Computer Science, Geography
22/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Amanda, As per my experience of counselling 1000's students over the past five years, Students Usually opt for Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics as a combination if they wish to venture into the field of Medical sciences, whereas you opted for a different subject choice, Can you explain the same?
22/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 876 8536: In my research as per my career it was noted that in university, 2 subjects should be your major subjects and as for me thats Biology and Computer Science. Since I want to do biomedical engineering specialising in the IT field, I then found it not necessary to choose MBC as a combination
22/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Though your help would be very much appreciated, in case I researched and got the wrong information
22/11/23, 3:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted Amanda, As you are aware via the Edoofa Program you would get an opportunity to study abroad in a country like India which is known for its medical infrastructure and medical practices all over the world, Did you happen to research the course requirements for Medicine in India?
22/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 876 8536: I did not, can you please assist me with that
22/11/23, 3:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A-Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics, Chemistry and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
22/11/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 876 8536: So which course would be fit for my combination
22/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology (B.Sc Biotechnology) can be a strategic and beneficial choice for someone aspiring to study Biomedical Engineering. Let me outline the reasons why this combination could be advantageous for your goal:

23/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Yes sir <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
23/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
23/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 876 8536: I would like to study abroad because the educational system in my country as well as the economy is not quite as standard as it should be at the moment. So studying abroad will help me acquire standard education giving me exposure to different learning systems as well. And as I have researched India is one of the best countries in medical sciences, so it would be a very good opportunity for me
23/11/23, 3:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
23/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 876 8536: I have done my research but I haven't applied to any yet
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted please!
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great So as you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Am not aware of the costs yet could you please enlighten me on that
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
23/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 876 8536: So I'll be paying $2000 or even less through the earn and learn and the Edoofa program will pay the rest from the actual $6000
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Oh okay I understand
23/11/23, 4:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Yes please
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Oh okay I understand
23/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion.

Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

23/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *3. Webinars: -*

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

23/11/23, 4:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 876 8536: It really is what I was looking for
23/11/23, 5:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Thank you sir
24/11/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 382 5875: Morning
24/11/23, 11:41 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Amanda, Mr and Mrs Chidzoba @263788768536 @263773825875 @263773248322?
24/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 876 8536: Good morning sir
24/11/23, 11:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are you available for the session?
24/11/23, 11:45 am - +263 78 876 8536: Yes
24/11/23, 11:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 11:55 am - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture  with me!
24/11/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 876 8536: From my perspective this is the Edoofa Life cycle which shows 6 stages that lead a student to completion. Stage 1 shows how one is educated and councelled upon his/her career choice and education on the Edoofa program. Stage 2 is a demonstration on typical test to see one's capabilities. Stage 3 and 4 show ones acceptance and enrolment into the Edoofa program after a successful completion of Stage 1 and 2.
Stage 5 is how one has become a full member of the Edoofa program. Stage 6 is the verification stage and application of visa to start your education within the Edoofa program
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee.
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalmentsm thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
24/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
24/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Ok I understand
24/11/23, 12:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
24/11/23, 12:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth. 


2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off


3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.

4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*. <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 12:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
24/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 876 8536: I think the Earn while you learn program is the most interesting part about Edoofa. It is a unique and innovative program that you don't find in most scholarship programmes
From what I've learnt so far this program natures a student to become the best of herself/himself through earning points that increase the chances of his/her scholarship percentage
24/11/23, 12:45 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
24/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 876 8536: You had not yet mentioned that
24/11/23, 1:01 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
24/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 876 8536: I understand
24/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
24/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:40 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
24/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Understood
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the student's complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 876 8536: Okkay sir
24/11/23, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
24/11/23, 2:55 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.

1. What is the name of the course that *Amanda* would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

30/11/23, 5:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.
