I'm sorry I was a bit busy but tomorrow I'll participate
17/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 079 1620: 1. What motivated me to apply for the edoofa scholarship program is the fact that  it has been my dream to study in India though I'm struggling financially but I thought well this is my chance to pursue my dreams .Last but not least I would say I got the motivation from my mother who is a vendor and she has been encouraging me to apply for scholarships abroad ...
17/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 079 1620: 2.Well what I rlly understood about the program is that there's something like a business one would be doing aside in order to cater for fees if he/she is struggling financially so in other words you will be studying and making money to pay for the studies
18/11/23, 9:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Nesisa, How are you?

Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
18/11/23, 12:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
