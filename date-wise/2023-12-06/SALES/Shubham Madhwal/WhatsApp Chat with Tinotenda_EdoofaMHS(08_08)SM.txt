I am Tinotenda Mapedzamombe and l once applied to your scholarship program but back then l wasn't able to process the required payment in order to reserve my seat because my parents were facing some financial crisis. Initially l was accepted and l was also given an offer letter after having completed the steps while applying. I am now considering continuing my application process and securing my seat in the program. Is it possible for to continue the application process
