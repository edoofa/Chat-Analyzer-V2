20/11/23, 9:03 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions"*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
20/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 397 3316: Indeed we will try making a difference gud morning to you too
20/11/23, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs.Simon,

You can address me as Mr Singh, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 397 3316: Well thanks you Mr Singh am honored
20/11/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Simon, I can see Mufaro got to know about the Edoofa Program from Persistance, is that correct?
20/11/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 397 3316: Yes
20/11/23, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Persistance, also do tell me whether you learnt about Persistance's Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 397 3316: Well l learnt a lot from her experience and this had motivated me a lot through my journey
20/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: That is great Mrs Simon, let me also brief you about the program.
20/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
20/11/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 150 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/11/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for Mufaro so that just like these students she can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards her higher education by herself and help her parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
20/11/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 397 3316: indeed Mr and this can help her to also think out of the box and get to meet new peers of her age socialising together
20/11/23, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: Well thought Mrs Simon.
20/11/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Simon, as we start her counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
20/11/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
20/11/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
20/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 397 3316: l think so .l wanted to know abt accommodation and food
20/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 397 3316: Okay yeah sure
20/11/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Sure Mrs Simon, what is the issue?
20/11/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 397 3316: You ask her counseling session
20/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 397 3316: Is it provided or  l should provide that for her
20/11/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: Is Mufaro available for the session?
20/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 397 3316: Yes she is
20/11/23, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Well, that expense is to be borne by you, but affordable accommodations are available on the University campus and if still you want more affordable accommodation you can find University approved accommodations outside the campus that are more affordable.

20/11/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mufaro, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 397 3316: well maybe later
20/11/23, 1:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 397 3316: No we are not
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
20/11/23, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:50 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 397 3316: $2000 should be paid every year or
20/11/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Yes. that is correct.
20/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Okay thank you
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Mufaro what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 397 3316: So l can l ask you a question so the scholarship is providing how much percentage
20/11/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: The scholarship reduces the cost of education anywhere from 50% to 100%.
20/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Okay that's wonderful
20/11/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
20/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Yes
20/11/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: Mufaro, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
20/11/23, 1:58 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/11/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Yeah that's fine
20/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Alright
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 397 3316: I can have a idea about edoofa
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
_It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
_Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
20/11/23, 2:06 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Yeah it will help me alot
20/11/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mufaro, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
20/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Okay so that means if I'm studying l should also work so that my year expenses will be low
20/11/23, 2:12 pm - Gurvinder: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Yes Mufaro, not only EWYL helps you to self finance a major part of your education, but you also learn skills that make you more employable.
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 397 3316: I get the point
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Okay sure
20/11/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/11/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
20/11/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Okay thank you for making able to get the sense of it
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Mufaro, by now I hope you must have understood that Edoofa Scholarship Program is not a place where students get an opportunity to be just admitted in an Internationally Recognized University, rather it is much more than that. While there are multiple differentiators, Edoofa’s offered value to a particular student is more that what any admission agent/consultant may provide.
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: They even encountered Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program in 2018-2019 but hadn't proceeded due to the lure of quick earnings within the country. However, this year, those student shared their hardships, with some holding prestigious degrees from institutions like UZ, MSU, and HIT, now working as petrol attendants or mobile/laptop repair technicians. Others faced even greater challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.
20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Observing this scenario, it's evident that many of them regret not seizing the opportunity earlier. I as your counselor understand the harsh realities that are there in your home country. What are your thoughts regarding the same Mufaro?
20/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 397 3316: I think as students we should have time to discover what you need to do even as students faced hardships in finding jobs , we could also find technical jobs
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 397 3316: I can explain why I'm saying that ,even the country had shortage of jobs you could do something so that we can improve the living standards
20/11/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: I do agree with what you are saying, EWYL is meant for such a purpose only so that students get trained in skills that are a necessity in future jobs.
20/11/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mufaro, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Yeah
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Okay thanks
20/11/23, 2:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
20/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 397 3316: I had but they did not have any final say about it
20/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 397 3316: So l have one last question this course is should be started next year if l get the scholarship right
20/11/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Yeah sure about it
20/11/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Yes you are correct.
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Yeah I'm
20/11/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Mufaro as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 397 3316: 1500
20/11/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mufaro, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Thank you very much , l will look forward to it
20/11/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 397 3316: Ok
20/11/23, 3:21 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: Mufaro basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: *Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
20/11/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/11/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: However Mufaro, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: @263773973316 Since we are about to complete the counseling session for Mufaro's application, would it be possible that you can be connected with me for the next 10 minutes. I would also like to ask you whether you are connected with any benifeciary of the Edoofa program or with any Zimbabwean parent whose child is studying in India under the Edoofa program.
20/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Well Mufaro, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
21/11/23, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Everyone!
I hope this message finds you all in the best of your spirits.
21/11/23, 9:35 am - Gurvinder: So are you available for the session?

21/11/23, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: I am fine Mrs.Simon.

21/11/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: Mrs.Simon, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
21/11/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: So do you want to change the course?
21/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 397 3316: No but l just want to see
21/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 397 3316: Firstly we need to pay $350 for the application to apply
21/11/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Mrs.Simon, this is a counselling session and I have advised you on the course that matches with your child's interest and passion. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 397 3316: And we have to apply for 5 university
21/11/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 397 3316: Okay thanks
21/11/23, 11:00 am - Gurvinder: Mrs.Simon, after you pay the enrollment fee, we are the ones that will handle all your application process to different universities.
You don't have to apply to any university yourself.
21/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 397 3316: It's okay
21/11/23, 11:04 am - Gurvinder: Yes Mrs.Simon and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
21/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 397 3316: Yeah l have understand that
21/11/23, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
21/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 397 3316: Okay I'm waiting
21/11/23, 11:09 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Stage 5
Alright Mrs Simon, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/11/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 397 3316: Yeah l did
21/11/23, 11:14 am - Gurvinder: Stage 6

Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/11/23, 11:15 am - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
21/11/23, 11:16 am - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
21/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 397 3316: Lastly l have one last question so the enrolment will be next year right
21/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 397 3316: Mufaro ,is waiting for her o'level results in February so we will wait for that
21/11/23, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
21/11/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: Mrs.Simon, this is just a counselling session, after this we are going to check the eligibility for Mufaro.
21/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 397 3316: Okay
21/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 397 3316: I don't have anything to ask
21/11/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
21/11/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
