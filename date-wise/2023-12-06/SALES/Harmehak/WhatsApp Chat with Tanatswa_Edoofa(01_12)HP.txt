So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
05/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 956 3791: Edoofa Scholarship is education for all and it helps your to attain your dream studies
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Well received, Tanatswa, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

05/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: It's great that they are supportive, Tanatswa.
05/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
05/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 956 3791: Okay
05/12/23, 11:34 am - Harmehak: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
05/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 956 3791: Yeah l am confident
05/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Wonderful
05/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
05/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 956 3791: Okay am doing maths physics and chemistry
05/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 956 3791: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Duly noted.
05/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: I await your response to the remaining part.
05/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 956 3791: My A level combination is Maths Physics and Chemistry
05/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Yes please, I have noted the same.
05/12/23, 11:51 am - Harmehak: However I would like to know what motivates you to study Medicine, Tanatswa?
05/12/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 956 3791: Many women are dying of cervical cancer yearly and it  is increasing every year so l would like to study medicine to help woman to be aware of this deadly disease and encourage them  for early cancer screening
05/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind thoughts to assist people in the world and especially women, Tanatswa.

So did you ever happen to research about your desired course too?
05/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 956 3791: Yes ,l have
05/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: What all did you learn about the requirements for medicine in India please?
05/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 77 956 3791: You should have Chemistry
05/12/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Alright, however don't you believe Biology is one of the important subjects too for Medicine?

Considering biology and medicine are both about the human body and living beings itself.
05/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 956 3791: Yes biology is also important
05/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

So why didn't you happen to pursue the same in your A level please?
05/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 956 3791: I had an A in physics so l was offered a combination which includes physics and l was good at physics
05/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Oh thats understandable!
05/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 956 3791: Okay
05/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics* <This message was edited>

05/12/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: So far, what all did you understand, Tanatswa?
05/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 956 3791: I understood that in Medicine biology is also important and that edoofa Scholarship reduces the burden financially
05/12/23, 12:33 pm - Harmehak: Very well!
05/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: So given the options, Tanatswa, you can also pursue any of the Engineering fields too with your subject combination.

05/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: While I understand the same Tanatswa!
