17/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Yes sir
17/08/23, 2:50 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay well @263716354736, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me in 100 to 150 words each:-

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career?
2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
17/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 635 4736: By studying in India I will be able to research and also collaborate with experts. This implements a positive impact on my career as I will be enlightened with more ideas. 

Studying in India will also help me improve my English as India is the largest English speaking nation in the world hence I will be able to communicate with people from all corners of the world. 

A plethora of global leaders are Indians therefore this motivates me and implement a positive impact on my career. 

Studying in India open doors to career opportunities worldwide therefore this helps me to achieve my dreams and my career.
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Amazing Precious, I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
17/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 71 635 4736: No sir
17/08/23, 3:37 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
17/08/23, 3:37 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
17/08/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Ok I understand
17/08/23, 3:44 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
17/08/23, 3:45 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Oh ok sir
17/08/23, 3:48 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: In simple words Precious, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1200-$1800, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.* <This message was edited>
17/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Yes I understand sir
17/08/23, 3:58 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So now Precious would you like to ask anything or shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
17/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Yes 
I would to ask the types of activities that will be carried out in the Earn While You Learn Program
17/08/23, 4:02 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Let me brief you about it in depth for your clarity please!
17/08/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Ohk sir
17/08/23, 4:04 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263716354736, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
17/08/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Ok sir noted
17/08/23, 4:40 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

17/08/23, 4:41 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting your child?*
17/08/23, 4:54 pm - +263 71 502 0787: So much sir and am so much willing to have her admitted if she manages to meet the requirements
17/08/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you sir for giving my daughter all the information .That will help her on her decision. I wish her admitted into your school
17/08/23, 4:59 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I am glad to know that Mr Patson and Ms Gutu, now comes the interesting part since, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
17/08/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 502 0787: Studying in India will give her a lot of exposure on the international arena moreso the above mentioned high profile individuals are an inspiration
17/08/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 502 0787: Following sir
Sorry for a late response my network is giving some challenges
17/08/23, 7:05 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

17/08/23, 7:06 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different as we help our students in planning and sponsoring their higher education, in fact your child can self sponsor their higher education with the Financial Aid that Edoofa is providing, isn’t it something that you have been looking for their international education?
17/08/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 502 0787: Thank you if you may enlighten on the kind of employment they'll be engaged in
17/08/23, 7:46 pm - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care and do watch the video I am sharing below.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

17/08/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 502 0787: Thank you so much
Keep well and hoping to continue tomorrow
18/08/23, 9:04 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Good Morning Precious, Hope you are doing well

As discussed yesterday, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 502 0787: Good morning sir
18/08/23, 9:06 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: How are you doing Mr Patson?
18/08/23, 9:07 am - +263 71 635 4736: Good morning sir... Yes we may start
18/08/23, 9:07 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Did you watch the video I shared with you?
18/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 502 0787: Am good hoping the same with you sir
18/08/23, 9:19 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Likewise Mr Patson!
18/08/23, 9:19 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: So Precious did you watch the video I shared yesterday please?
18/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 502 0787: Peaise thee
18/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 502 0787: On her behalf my apologies she might be facing some network challenge but she's following
We're in a different location
18/08/23, 9:23 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Oh alright so Mr Patson, in that case shall we continue with our discussion please?
18/08/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 635 4736: Yes sir I did
18/08/23, 9:36 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so Precious, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, is there anything you would like to ask from whatever we have discussed so far?
18/08/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 502 0787: Unfortunately personally I'm a bit tied up but we can do it on a slow pace though
18/08/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 635 4736: I just want to ask what sort of employment is offered?
18/08/23, 9:45 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: You mean in the Earn While You Learn Program or generally after a student completes his/her course?
18/08/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 635 4736: Oh i mean after a student completes the course
18/08/23, 9:48 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so Precious, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
18/08/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 502 0787: Or even earn while you learn program
18/08/23, 9:53 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 635 4736: So in the EWYL Program a student has to engage in a job that suits his or her course?
18/08/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 502 0787: Thanks
Understood sir
18/08/23, 9:58 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you were able to have a better clarity as well Precious?
18/08/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 635 4736: Ok I understand sir
18/08/23, 9:59 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Would you like to ask anything else please?
18/08/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 635 4736: It all seems fine sir
18/08/23, 10:10 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
18/08/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 635 4736: Yes I am ready
18/08/23, 10:14 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: @263716354736 as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
18/08/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 635 4736: A student will end up spending between $1500-$2250
18/08/23, 10:18 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Exactly @263716354736 , and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/08/23, 10:18 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 635 4736: Ok sir noted
18/08/23, 10:19 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: You see @263716354736 this is an amazing aspect about the program itself because for all the students who are found eligible for the Edoofa Program they get the benefit of Edoofa guaranteeing them admission and scholarship by helping them create the statement of purpose along with that they get opportunities where you can apply to multiple universities and receive an offer letter from them without any additional fee, and majorly this enrollment fee also includes the SEELS's Earn While You Learn Program. So apart from the Enrollment fee they wouldn't pay anything separate for their application fee or SOP fee!

So for an Edoofian the Enrollment Fee would include:

*1. Guaranteed Scholarship*
*2. Application fee of all the Edoofa’s Associated Universities*
*3. Cost of Multiple Statement of Purposes drafted*
*4. Recommendation Letter drafted for the Student*
*5. Earn While You Learn Program’s Training*
*6. Visa Assistance*

I hope now you will be in a better position to relate how Exactly Edoofa is trying to bring the change in the Admission process for International Students?
18/08/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 635 4736: Yes sir I can relate
18/08/23, 10:23 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: That's amazing @263716354736, so now as you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/08/23, 10:23 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Precious, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
18/08/23, 10:23 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/08/23, 10:29 am - +263 71 635 4736: Ok sir I understand
18/08/23, 10:33 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so Precious, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
18/08/23, 11:19 am - +263 71 635 4736: A student can be engaged in the Earn While You Learn Program which help the student to self sponsor their higher education by earning scholarship credits. 

Edoofa has affordable prices as it cuts down the costs of the student by undergoing various tests. These costs include food, accommodation, basic university expenses and the remaining tuition fees. 

In the first phase the student has to pay $350 in 7days. However due to the financial challenges in Africa the student will have to pay $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150  within 30 days. 

In phase 2 the student will be engaged in the EWYL classes. Lastly in phase 3 if the student passed the necessary requirements then their evaluation and admission will be continued.
18/08/23, 11:22 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Excellent Precious, from your response I can see you did understand the financial aspect of the Edoofa Program quite well, however I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
18/08/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 635 4736: Yes sir I did understand
18/08/23, 11:27 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Okay so now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
18/08/23, 11:29 am - +263 71 635 4736: No sir
18/08/23, 11:29 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 11:30 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Right now you see Precious, we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
18/08/23, 11:30 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/08/23, 11:37 am - +263 71 635 4736: Yes sir noted
18/08/23, 11:37 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/08/23, 11:37 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/08/23, 11:37 am - Piiyush Senior Carerr Counselor: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

18/08/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 502 0787: All I can say is I'm  so impressed

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.
C) supplement, while sweet whey is more desirable as a food additive for humans.
D) supplement, which provides an important element of their diet.

7.can pollute waterways
A) NO CHANGE
B) can pollute waterway’s,
C) could have polluted waterways,
D) has polluted waterway’s,

8.scientists; and
A) NO CHANGE
B) scientists: and
C) scientists, and
D) scientists, and,

9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed

The statement that many Africans have poor diet because their farms are stagnant and inefficient is true although to a lesser extent. 

Many Africans have their farms on slopes where erosion where erosion mostly takes places. Therefore their crops will not grow well hence leading to poor harvests. 

Some African farms have poor soils which are not suitable for the growth of a plethora of crops, for instance rice.

However, to some extent Africans have poor diet due to lack of finance. Most African people do not afford other food hence surviving mostly on carbohydrate giving food such as sadza and cassava. 

Furthermore, Africans' poor diet is due to lack of agricultural equipments. Africa is considered to be primitive hence the agricultural tools used are less effective on farming. Also the farming methods used by the Africans leads to poor harvests
