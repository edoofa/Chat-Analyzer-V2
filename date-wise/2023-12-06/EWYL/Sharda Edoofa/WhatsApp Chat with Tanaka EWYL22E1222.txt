Tenzin.edoofa@gmail.com
18/08/23, 3:42 pm - +91 78273 08969: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about
 Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
18/08/23, 3:42 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
18/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 216 0952: Okay maaam
18/08/23, 3:44 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 3:44 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 216 0952: Thank you
18/08/23, 3:47 pm - +91 78273 08969: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
18/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 216 0952: Noted
18/08/23, 3:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above. After you are satisfied with the student’s response, you will share about Edoofa’s Meet and Greet Session that happened in Harare. I am sharing the messages regarding that below:
 
I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below. The video is regarding Edoofa’s Meet and Greet session where Edoofa’s founders Mr. Angad Singh and Mr. Avreen Singh interacted with various School Principals, African students, and their parents in Harare, Zimbabwe last year.
Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

18/08/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 216 0952: Okay my network is slow but I'm going to watch the video
18/08/23, 3:58 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, After this, You can interact with students by asking if they have any queries so far or not. Once all the queries have been dealt with, It is now time that we share the Student Application Form with the students and ask them to share it in the group.
Feel free to take my help if you have any doubts regarding the queries that you might get from the students.

18/08/23, 4:02 pm - +91 78273 08969: So Tanaka now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you will explain to the student as we have discussed right?
18/08/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 216 0952: Yes I will
18/08/23, 4:05 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, That is all about this project. We will talk about the next one on Monday.

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
23/09/23, 8:53 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
23/09/23, 8:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Now let me share some important resources with you that you can share with the School Head.

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Edoofa is a *social-for-profit organization* that aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunities to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities✨.

In short, Edoofa is an embedded higher education program. They stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge being a Proud Edoofian!




Edoofa scholarship program is currently helping over *100 schools in Africa*, and over *3000 African students* are benefiting from our scholarship program. The school principals and teachers who are playing a significant role in our program are enjoying exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Now, to help the students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation, Edoofa has its own Earn While You Learn Program, which helps the students to learn skills and earn money in the form of scholarship credits to reduce their expenses.🙌


_Over the past 5 years, after counseling tens of thousands of students, Edoofa has gone in-depth in understanding the problems that students face. The Edoofa Program removes every obstacle standing between your student and his/her higher education dreams. Edoofa as an organization wants to make higher education affordable for every student studying in your school. Coupled with the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa wants to make your students employable who are equipped with all the skills that today’s industry needs, so that when a student from your school would return to your country, he/she has got more opportunities to chase him/her as compared to peers and so that you can add value to your school as well as country’s development/growth._



Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

Their associate partner, *Mr. Shorwi Kawadza* is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of *Hartzell High School*. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with them for the past *Four Years* from which more than _80 students_ have enrolled and arrived in India already.


The Child of the *DEO, Manicaland* Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 
_*United College of Education*_, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and _Respected Sir Adam Luthuli_ has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 


Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, _*Headmaster of Chibuwe High*_, the son of Ms. Christina Rockson, _The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School_, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, _DEO at Masvingo province_ are Edoofians and they have many more success stories from _St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High_, etc.
23/09/23, 8:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Along with this, schools can be benefited in the following way:
1. Free Educational Counseling for Parents of ‘A-Level’/SHS Students looking to Study Abroad.
2. Quality Career Guidance Program for Learners to become eligible for 50-100 percent Scholarship on Tuition Fees in Degree Programs in Top Indian Universities.
3. Opportunities for Collaboration for implementing the best practices of the Indian Education System in progressive African Schools.
4. Facilitating your school-nominated teachers/academicians who have accomplished a Master's degree and want to pursue a higher academic qualification(PHD.)(Part-Time) on a 50-100 percent Scholarship.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 25/10/2023

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.
