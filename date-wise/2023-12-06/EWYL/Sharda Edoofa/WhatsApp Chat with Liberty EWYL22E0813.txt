03/08/23, 11:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings and a lovely morning to you my dear student!
03/08/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 077 0016: Im fine Sir how are you . How is that side
03/08/23, 12:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am also good. Thank you so much for asking.
03/08/23, 12:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since Your program has been put on hold, I would like to know the anticipated timeframe for the resumption of your sessions.
15/09/23, 9:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Liberty

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Liberty I am happy to hear that.
Yes, I know exmas are around. I wish you all the very best for that.

Is it possible for your parents to join the session on your behalf for three days so that your basisc training is completed?
28/09/23, 1:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon *Liberty*
I hope you are doing well

Since your EWYL program has been put on hold due to your exams.
Can you let me know *when are your exams getting over so that we can resume our EWYL sessions?*
28/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 077 0016: im going to finish on 24 November

I am aware of the ongoing examination, and I wish you all the very best for the same. Given that you will be keeping busy the examination I want you to complete the fast-track EWYL training session which will not take more than 2 days if attended regularly.
These sessions can also be attended by your parents on our behalf.

During these sessions, I will share a procedure through which we will be able to put your EWYL Program on hold and then we will resume it once your examinations will get over.

1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things you are good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
