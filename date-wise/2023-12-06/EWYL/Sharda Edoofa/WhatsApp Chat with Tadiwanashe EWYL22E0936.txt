Happy Reading!


Wishing you a wonderful day ahead
17/08/23, 8:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning, *Esteemed Learner!*
How are you?

It's an honor to have such dedicated students join me for this scheduled session.
Are you ready for it?
17/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning Ma'am.  I'm alright and I can't wait to start the session
17/08/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: So, Tadiwanashe did you go through the wednesday lesson?
17/08/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 679 0424: Who can ever speak about India's success without talking about programmers especially at a younger age? As for me my second choice was of being computer engineer especially with the fact that I knew I was going to India,  I didn't think otherwise. I have one of my role models is Satya Nadella who works for one of the biggest companies in the world which is Microsoft. He is actually the CEO .... and he is a pure breed of India. He showed a lot impact of being a leader and with coding I don't think anyone can stop you. Today's world is just technology. We surviving on technology and for our lives to be better we need technology ... 
From my own perspective and understanding from the Wednesday lesson I think  nothing can stop you from achieving your goals no matter the age or difficulties. Use what you're interested in to make your future a better place.  Some people just think about money but sometimes it is better to just care for other people for the outcome may make your name a memorable one. For example Aadya Joshi a teenage entrepreneur who founded an organisation to help students from rural areas. Everyone can imagine on how can a teenage form an organisation and Aadya is there to give the answer.
17/08/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 679 0424: Yess I did , for a moment I asked myself what I am I doing with my life
17/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great job on completing your homework! Your commitment to learning is impressive
17/08/23, 8:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: which means, the lesson was very motivating, right?
17/08/23, 8:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: Were there any questions that arose for you during or after the lesson that you'd like to explore further or discuss today?
17/08/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 679 0424: Thank you ma'am... it was indeed motivating
17/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 679 0424: This question is an academic one ... just wanted to ask if it is possible to practice some coding whilst I'll be doing my program of BSC in Geography
17/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Absolutely, it's definitely possible to practice coding while pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Geography or any other field. In fact, having coding skills can enhance your capabilities and open up various opportunities in geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, data analysis, and more.
17/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Start with the basics of programming, such as learning a programming language like Python or R. There are numerous online resources, tutorials, and courses available that cater to beginners. As you progress, you can explore more advanced topics related to your specific interests within geography.
17/08/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: Remember, coding is a skill that takes time and practice to develop, so don't be discouraged by initial challenges. The ability to code will not only complement your geography studies but also make you a more versatile and competitive professional in the job market.
17/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 679 0424: I've been practicing for about 2 years now but I've been using Visual basic and still yet to use python which I feel like is going to be my favourite
17/08/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good job *Tadiwanashe*
I already see a coder in the room.
17/08/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: See, if start enjoying it, it is the best thing around.
17/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 679 0424: I just know the basics😂😂
17/08/23, 9:10 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'll try python and see if I can get it easily
17/08/23, 9:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: See if you will not get it in one go, you will eventually get with continuous practice.
17/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 679 0424: Will definitely try continuous practices
17/08/23, 9:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: Indeed you will, I have all my faith in you.
17/08/23, 9:28 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Thank you all for your active participation today. Looking forward to our next insightful session!*
17/08/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 679 0424: Thank you ma'am... enjoy your day
17/08/23, 9:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: You too have a great time.
18/08/23, 8:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
21/08/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Scholar!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
21/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 679 0424: How are ma'am
21/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'm ready for the lesson
21/08/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am good, thank you so much for asking.
21/08/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: From today we will start discussing our projects.
21/08/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
21/08/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions

1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
21/08/23, 9:37 am - Sharda Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 


Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.


I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
22/08/23, 8:27 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning Ms Sharda... hope you had good night
22/08/23, 8:29 am - +263 71 679 0424: 1) Project 1 ..Cooperate alliances
Project 2.. Community building 
Project 3.. African Schools Education Reform Mission
22/08/23, 8:30 am - +263 71 679 0424: COOPERATE ALLIANCES

First and foremost...  everyone might die to know what cooperate alliances mean and I'm going to define it in a more understandable manner which is of separating the two words  and briefly explaining about it. Cooperate as my first word is to work or act as a team, side by side so as to achieve the common goal and an alliance is now the connection or the union of you and your team for example two families joined together by marriage or partnership in a business.  


My understanding from the first project which is not a very easy one is I'm being asked to reach out to one of the nearby companies or organisation on behalf of Edoofa maybe throught the Internet or any other links. I'm to mainly focus on technology based companies like for example FinTech. It'll be important for me to know the number of employees which has to be at leats 20, the yearly revenue and even the allowances. This will be for part 1
As for part 2, I'll be now reaching out to the CEOs of the companies and the decision makers in more respectful and inform them about my situation as a student and how im thriving and hungry to get the incentives.
Part 3 will be now of sharing the message from Edoofa with the company and make the Alliance much stronger. 
To make it much more stronger, on part 4 the Edoofa managers then make a video call with the managers and signing of contract.
Lastly.... it's the record keeping stage whereby I record the progress of the project on Excel
22/08/23, 8:30 am - +263 71 679 0424: COMMUNITY BUILDING

From my point of view .... community building is bringing people together and create a sense of togetherness and focus on a common goal or interest. 
I found this task to be an easy one of spreading the network of Edoofa through my colleagues and convince them on how cool and legit it is . First I'll have to create a list of my friends who are close and part of the extended network on those who have graduated from their senior high school or are in their last six months period. We'll then have to create a strategy of how to reach out to my fellow friends and the entire network.  I think the follow ups and all the leads will be now being pursued by the Edoofa counselors. Finally  ... it's the scholarship credits ... For every student that enrols in to the Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, I'll will be getting $20 worth of Scholarship credits.
22/08/23, 8:30 am - +263 71 679 0424: AFRICAN SCHOOLS EDUCATION REFORM MISSION 

The final project is of students reaching out to Local Schools in their local region and speaking to the headmasters or principals to collaborate with Edoofa.. creating an alliance between them.
First I'll have to reach out to them and tell them the convincing reasons why we want to help and the benefits in it. 

My first task will be of making a list of the higher secondary schools in my area... identify the decision makers which are definitely the headmasters as per our country. Reaching out to them will be easier , since I'll be receiving a well written message and email that Edoofa would have helped me create. The headmasters will then communicate with the Edoofa Administrators
22/08/23, 8:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Student, Welcome!
Hope you are doing well!

 It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
22/08/23, 8:38 am - +263 71 679 0424: Yes ma'am I'm ready
22/08/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
22/08/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done, Tadiwanashe!
It clearly shows that you have read the document in detail. Keep it Up!✈️
22/08/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE
22/08/23, 8:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
22/08/23, 8:40 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 8:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
22/08/23, 8:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio, Tadiwanashe?
22/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 679 0424: Still listening to it for the second time
22/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'm done listening to it ...
22/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 679 0424: Do I have to just focus on digital marketing companies and tech related companies only or..
22/08/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: I will tell you this.
22/08/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
22/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 71 679 0424: Okay 
... so I understood that I'm starting to prepare for my future with the projects ... and the first one of cooperate alliances help me gain experience at an early stage and I have to set my goals towards the technologically driven and digital companies. To do this I have to boost my network maybe through family ... or friends ... or friend's parents or even the linked in app. This will help me reach out to managers and communicate initiating conversations and gathering their contacts so that they can make meetings with the Edoofa team
22/08/23, 9:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Tadiwanashe. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me! <This message was edited>
22/08/23, 9:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 9:12 am - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
22/08/23, 9:44 am - +263 71 679 0424: From my understanding,  I'm being given a task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are willing to extend their help in the development of all the students that enrol for the EDOOFA programme.
Before I proceed with the applications I have to first take into consideration some factors like the NATURE OF A COMPANY to see whether it can help in the boost of the students body for example recreational ie of social interaction platforms. I should consider the number of employees as well. The company must neither be very small nor big. Its financial stability is also a key especially for the workers wages and allowances. It can  be easier to search for such companies throught the help of platforms like Google... linked in ... twitter and even Facebook.
So the first thing I have to do is getting a few details regarding the nature of the company, and then , start studying a little 
more about the company & its functioning. I can study about the company maybe through social media platforms. This will help give the idea of how the company has been functioning and the kind of activities that have been happening lately. After checking the background of people associated with the company, I'll start reaching out to them by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request . I'll definitely start sending to the managers before I reach out to the CEOs or founders .
22/08/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: You know what Tadiwanashe, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
22/08/23, 9:51 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
22/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
22/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Second and the fun part- I’m sure you have read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
22/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
22/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: We can utilize platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly LinkedIn to assist us in finding suitable companies. 
To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms 
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
LinkedIn Profile Link:
22/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
22/08/23, 9:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: *If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.*
23/08/23, 8:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well

Your eagerness to learn is infectious, and I'm excited to explore new concepts and ideas with you

Let's make this session a place where questions lead to discoveries
Are you ready for it?
23/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning ma'am.... yaah I'm ready for the lesson ...
23/08/23, 8:42 am - Sharda Edoofa: How are you?
23/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'm alright.... just kind of exhausted.... I spent the whole night trying to find the small scale educational companies
23/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 679 0424: How about you .... How's your side
23/08/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am good, thank you so much for asking.
23/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: I see that you have already started putting in efforts.
23/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, there is an update that I would like to share with you-

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
23/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING
23/08/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Tadiwanashe!
23/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 679 0424: Let's move ....
23/08/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you can briefly share your understanding of the audio.
23/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 679 0424: From my understanding community building is for us to develop networking and communication skills and obviously learn how to leverage social media in order to offer us African students to join Edoofa  educational system which helps us attain international education. The project also helps students have the identifying mindset especially to opportunities and sharing them openly to others. For the project to be a success , I have to go to students who have recently graduated from the secondary school or are currently in their final year of finishing the exams. Finally there are scholarship credits to be won after every successful project
23/08/23, 9:29 am - Sharda Edoofa: It's time to wrap up today's session 

Your commitment to learning shines bright. 

Reflect on the insights gained, and get ready to dive into new horizons tomorrow.
23/08/23, 9:35 am - +263 71 679 0424: Sure thing... enjoy your day ma'am
24/08/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well.

           So, are you ready to start our session?
24/08/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning Ms Sharda... I hope you are doing well as well
24/08/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'm ready for the session
24/08/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes I am very well, thank you so much.
24/08/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome- Tadiwanashe, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
Are you ready?
24/08/23, 8:56 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you have to share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they deserve to be Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

24/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 679 0424: Yes I'm ready we may continue
24/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 679 0424: Ma'am ... wanted to ask what if you have given someone the link and that person is already doing the Edoofa processes
24/08/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: No, you have to get fresh students who can be enrolled through you.
24/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 679 0424: So that person doesn't count even though the link is just recent
24/08/23, 9:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: What do you want to ask exactly?

If that person has been referred by someone else and is already in Edoofa then that person will not be counted for you.
24/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 679 0424: It's alright ma'am I have other friends to use as recriuts

25/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 679 0424: Good morning Ms Sharda
25/08/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
25/08/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'm good .... how are you
25/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am also good, thank you.
25/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 71 679 0424: Yeah ... we may begin
25/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
25/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
25/08/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_
25/08/23, 8:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'll create the group but I think I'll need some time to look for the students since I'm no longer in high school
25/08/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: That I understand.
25/08/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Have you gone through the audio?
25/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 679 0424: Yes and I've understood everything... it was very clear
25/08/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
25/08/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 679 0424: I was asked to create a group which is a better method to network with other students who are currently in form 6 and who are done with form 6. Once I'm done creating the group I don't know whether I have to add the head coach Ms Davi or I'll be adding my very own mentor Ms Sharda but what I know I'll be adding one to monitor the way I'll be communicating with my fellow friends. She also said I must give every necessary detail to help others and convince them to make their dreams come true. She also mentioned a statement that I must use that I believe is convincing of students studying abroad at affordable prices.
25/08/23, 9:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Tadiwananshe, I am impressed with your understanding.
25/08/23, 9:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled

2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
25/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
25/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
25/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is how you have to make sure that the application form is filled
25/08/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 9:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
25/08/23, 9:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 9:23 am - Sharda Edoofa: This is very valuable information that you can definitely use while communicating with the students. Do you agree?
25/08/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 679 0424: Thank you ma'am... I think this is going to help a lot . I've added the information to my favourites
25/08/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 679 0424: But ma'am I wanted to ask that who am I going to add in the group that I'm going to create. Is it gonna be you or the head coach Ms Davi
25/08/23, 9:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: add me in the group. I will not say anything in the group. I will only be a silent observer
25/08/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 679 0424: Alright.. sure thing
25/08/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay, *Congratulations*

25/08/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 3: AFRICAN SCHOOL EDUCATION REFORM MISSION PROJECT
25/08/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
25/08/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 9:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.
25/08/23, 9:52 am - +263 71 679 0424: The African Schools education reform mission is the project whereby I'll be reaching out to Local Schools in our local region and speaking to the headmasters or principals to collaborate with Edoofa..
First I'll have to reach out to them and inform them about the Edoofa Program.  I can even tell them how I have planned for my future and how Edoofa is helping me out. After talking with them about Edoofa , I'll have to simply ask bout their contacting details and set up an online meeting with the Edoofa team
25/08/23, 4:38 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright! This is all for today.
So we will resume our session Monday onwards from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and your sessions will be held from Monday to Friday.

Till then Have a great weekend!🌸
29/08/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Student, Welcome!
Hope you are doing well!

 It's a pleasure to have you join me for this scheduled session
Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
29/08/23, 4:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
01/09/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Scholar!
A wonderful day to you

07/09/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Lately I've been waiting for dates to come from PDM university and its kind of taking so long even though I'm waiting patiently. I was wondering if it is possible to try and reconnect with LPU university since they once accepted my application but I had put my decision on PDM. So I wanted to ask you first before I talk with the Admission officers if it is possible for me to join LPU and maybe catch up with others since I'm now ready

08/09/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: Do let me know the further updates from the admission team.
08/09/23, 8:39 am - +263 71 679 0424: It's alright. It's just a question I've been waiting ti ask for days
08/09/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: And do not worry at all, inform me if you do not get a reply. I will remind them.
08/09/23, 8:39 am - +263 71 679 0424: Thank you ma'am... truly appreciate

08/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 679 0424: I'll surely do so
08/09/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 679 0424: Thank you ... hope its going to go well
08/09/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes it will surely.
08/09/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let us finish discussing our project 3
08/09/23, 8:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
08/09/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School is *not connected* with Edoofa:
08/09/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/09/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: If the School *is connected* with Edoofa:
08/09/23, 8:47 am - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
08/09/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following?
08/09/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 679 0424: 1.. I learnt at Kutama College 
2..I had not yet prepared a statement or message I would use to reach out to headmasters.. I think that one is coming from Edoofa
3.. Mashonaland West
08/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 679 0424: Yes I do agree.. all students should have access to wider range of educational opportunities
08/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 679 0424: Yes ma'am I'm following... and understanding
08/09/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
08/09/23, 8:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
08/09/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
08/09/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Mr./Mrs. [School Head's Name],

08/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day, *Tadiwanashe*! I'd like to kick off this session with a motivating quote by Robert Frost: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." As we gather here today, let's reflect on the path we've chosen, the journey we're on, and how it's shaping our lives.
08/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In today’s session we will discuss a  *Guide to Excelling in the Community Building Project*

To begin with I would like to tell you that the Community Building Project is a crucial aspect of our institution, offering the chance to earn credits and ease the financial burden on your sponsors and parents. With increased rewards, it's essential to focus on honesty, transparency, and sharing your experiences. Your role in selecting and supporting potential community members can have a significant positive impact on your fellow students.
08/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Yes I still remember about the project whereby I link up or connect with my friends who have finished or  about to finish high school and this can be done by creating a group that I'll add everyone that I would have recruited into the Edoofa process
08/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes that is true!
08/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Importance of the Community Building Project*
The Community Building Project is a significant opportunity within our institution.
It helps reduce the financial burden on your sponsors and parents by earning credits.
The success of this project is vital for our institution's growth and our ability to create opportunities for students.
*Project Enhancements and Increased Rewards*
The rewards for the Community Building Project have been raised to $300, making it even more important.
With increased rewards come higher expectations for performance, effort, and project approach.
08/11/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *The Power of Honesty and Sharing*
Honesty, transparency, and authentic conversations with people lead to the best results in this project.
Your personal experiences in India, such as access to electricity and the internet, are valuable resources to share with those back home.
Sharing your story helps build confidence, creativity, empathy, and presentation skills.
*Your Role in the Community*
You will receive training to excel in the Community Building Project.
You'll have the opportunity to select students who are ready for this opportunity and shortlist applicants.
Your involvement in this project can make a significant impact on the lives of your fellow students in your home country.
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Yes I was actually now starting the project of recruiting people especially from my former school. I've been telling them about the scholarship credits which is something that is convincing and I was also pleased to be told about the $300 project which is something that is very helpful and convincing
08/11/23, 2:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes Tadiwanshe, I am glad to know you have started to work on the project.
08/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 679 0424: I'm just trying my best ma'am 😂
08/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, this should be the spirit.
08/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 679 0424: So ma'am after the person that I'd have recruited paid the enrolment fee.  I'm supposed to tell you about it or it'll just be automatically recorded on my records
08/11/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It will get recorded on its own.
08/11/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now I am sharing a document with you, kindly go through it and share your understanding of the same.
08/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am sure that you must have heard of two extremely interesting & informative activities during your initial orientation of the EWYL program that are *wednesday wisdom & saturday activity.*

While we have not been sharing them with you after your arrival in India considering all of you had just arrived and were busy in settling down, managing your time table along with the EWYL sessions, and also in the administrative tasks like processing of FRRO, Fee related processes & also your classes.

Now we have ensured that starting from today, we share them with you so that all of you can utilize the most out of the very carefully chosen resources and training material.
08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Hope you are well.

I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a *Diwali Activity*.
09/11/23, 1:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️
09/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Hello ma'am how are you.

14/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Hello ma'am....  I'm delighted as well to hear from .... Diwali festival has been wonderful until we received sad news about one of friend's parents. Tanaka , the one in the middle on the picture lost his father today. Its still hard to accept it but we are trying our best to be there for him .
14/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 679 0424: But I hope you enjoying your Diwali festival though

Program?
2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?
3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain

24/11/23, 4:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: No, just write the answers here only. Type the answers.
24/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Ms Sharda as for question number 1 I wanted to ask for clearance about the shot put district level.... I'm not understanding
24/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Because as for me , the only event I've participated in ... was of dancing
24/11/23, 5:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for this. Let me send the right question to you.
24/11/23, 5:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I'm excited to share that I am planning to feature your achievement in our upcoming weekly newsletter. Your valuable insights will contribute significantly to the educational discourse within our community. In order to get featured you will have to share the answers to the following mentioned questions before today end of the day.

*1. Kindly provide a brief introduction of yourself and delineate the essence of the Freshers party dance competition competition.*

*2.Building on the earlier introduction, please elaborate on the insights gained from your participation.*

*3. Kindly offer a concise and motivational note to our fellow Edoofians.*
24/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 71 679 0424: My name is Tadiwanashe Gweshe always known as gweshman.I am a very proud Edoofian. I'm in my early stages of being an adult with 20 years of age. Last month i started the journey to fullfill one of my dreams which is of having my tertiary education in another country which is basically happening right now. I was very fortunate that i arrived before the freshers party and to be honest i really enjoyed this item. For the first time I participated in the dancing competition with my fellow brothers Nigel... Allan... Tanaka... DJ Kango... and to my surprise we managed to win the first price, not the second or third but the first price which is something that shocked everyone.
24/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 71 679 0424: This message was deleted
24/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Even me I'm still shocked as well. I couldn't believe that, that was my first time. I personally did it for enjoyments but ended up learning a lot. The first thing I learnt was you can never discover your talent if you don't try something out and this is the right tine to do so. The other lesson is education isn't the only key to success but extra curricula activities can even make it better only when you practise i them with passion.
24/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 679 0424: My advice to my fellow Edoofians is always be self motivated when it comes to self discovery and when you want to try something, do it with passion. Don't hesitate to ask for help when you dont know. This is the only way you can uncover your weaknesses. One last thing is never wait for the perfect moment, just take the moment and make it perfect.

25/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 679 0424: Ma'am... I wanted to ask that after someone is done filling this application form what am I supposed to do
25/11/23, 3:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After this you have to submit the filled student application form to me.
25/11/23, 3:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
I am an energetic, patient, hardworking and reliable individual who is eager to learn and very passionate in SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. I am also concerned about my future i.e how will my life be if I my dreams do not come true, therefore am looking for financial assistance and also willing to study in India as it is one of the most developing countries in technology. Thank You

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.

Best Regards
TEAM EWYL!
