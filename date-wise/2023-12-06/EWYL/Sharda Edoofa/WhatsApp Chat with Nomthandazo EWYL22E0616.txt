 _Community Building_
This refers to the process of stabilizing and strengthening connections, relationships and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community.
 👉This involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where students feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate, communicate and work towards common goals.
👉The role of the Community Building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.
👉The shared belief is the core of the second project which is community building.
The primary outcome is this project is for students to develop networking skills and to learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoofa's education ecosystem and acquire international education that prepares them for the future.
➡️By reaching out to personal extended networks, students will identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers and direct them to this opportunity.
👉 This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others.
👉 To successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their secondary schools or are currently in a final year of senior secondary education.
👉 As a member of the Edoofa team it will be expected of me to use my networking in persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help the organization group.
👉 Throughout the project Edoofa will provide a guidance and support to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts.
👉 For every student that enrols and pays up first part of the enrollment fee the referring student will receive $20 worth scholarship credits and upon completion of the admission formalities of the university, the referring student will receive $30 worth is scholarship credits!

05/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 166 8266: Thank you
05/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 166 8266: Thus an effective way of drawing in students👏 <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes it is.
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
