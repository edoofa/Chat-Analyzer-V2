17/08/23, 2:42 pm - +91 78886 93132: I understood that if I'm eligible for the grant and has earned
any amount of scholarship credits, I Will be able to access and redeem the higher value
opportunity i.e either grant amount or scholarship credit
which ever is higer and will forego the lower value opportunity (either grant or
scholarship credit)in orderto secure the best option for high
affordability
and the foregone Credit/Grant will not be carried forward to th
next year. Next academic year will have the revised grant and
credit opportunities as per the performance in the previous
year.  Again for me to be a beneficiary of the grant I have to maintain 75% and about attendance in my classes and EWYL sessions.
17/08/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 2:44 pm - +91 78886 93132: I'm ready ma'am
17/08/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 2:51 pm - +91 78886 93132: I appreciate your vision ma'am
17/08/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you dear. Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - +91 78886 93132: I'm not sure but I think it's because of being committed to  EWYL program
17/08/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 3:04 pm - +91 78886 93132: Thank you for considering my efforts ma'am. I feel encouraged to work so hard so that I earn more and most importantly, as a way of appreciating you for seeing the inner Nkosilomusa and trust his potential.
17/08/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
17/08/23, 3:06 pm - +91 78886 93132: Thanks you ma'am. I will take your advice as a command. I promise to work so hard aiming high
17/08/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

17/08/23, 3:09 pm - +91 78886 93132: Here is my Grant undertaking form
17/08/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 3:17 pm - +91 78886 93132: Noted ma'am
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, May I know that do you have any questions?
17/08/23, 3:27 pm - +91 78886 93132: No ma'am. Everything is clear
17/08/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

29/08/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

25/10/23, 4:32 pm - +91 78886 93132: I think I didn't share enough information that can  educate them better about the Edoofa scholarship program and they decided not to join.

08/11/23, 4:30 pm - +91 78886 93132: Good evening ma'am. I'm sorry I wasn't able to come online. My FRRO is expiring tomorrow and my landlord is refusing to give me a new C form so I was trying to sort out something hoping he will understand. I even missed my classes today ma'am. I'm sorry
08/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 78886 93132: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 5:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Nkosilomusa, What did the landlord say?
08/11/23, 6:33 pm - +91 78886 93132: He was saying that I should use the old C form to renew my FRRO. Maybe he thought that I wanted to use it for something else. Again he was in Delhi so I had to wait for him in his office till he come. Fortunately he gave me the C form but I'm afraid that my attendance might be blocked until I receive my new FRRO.
08/11/23, 7:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Nkosilomusa, you should have done this a week earlier.
09/11/23, 6:15 am - +91 78886 93132: Yeah, but the landlord was refusing to give me the C form ma'am so there was nothing I could do.

Take a moment to reflect, and I look forward to your response within the next 20 minutes.
21/11/23, 12:29 pm - +91 78886 93132: I learnt that Self-actualization is a concept rooted in humanistic psychology. It represents the pinnacle of personal development, where individuals strive to realize their full potential and achieve a deep sense of fulfillment. At its core, self-actualization involves the pursuit of authenticity, creativity, and a profound understanding of oneself.

Contrary to societal norms that often emphasize external markers of success—popularity, power, fame, and money—self-actualization places greater importance on internal growth and character development. It's not about conforming to external expectations but rather aligning one's actions with their true values and beliefs. This shift in focus from extrinsic to intrinsic goals is essential for a genuine sense of accomplishment.

The hunger for popularity, power, fame, and money can be insatiable, leading individuals down paths that may not resonate with their authentic selves. Self-actualization encourages a departure from this external validation and prompts individuals to seek fulfillment within. While external achievements may bring temporary satisfaction, lasting contentment comes from living in accordance with one's principles and passions.

Character plays a pivotal role in the journey of self-actualization. It involves cultivating virtues such as integrity, resilience, and empathy. True success, in the context of self-actualization, is not just about the tangible outcomes but also about the person one becomes in the process. Building a strong and virtuous character becomes a compass guiding individuals through life's challenges, anchoring them in their values even when faced with adversity.

Overcoming criticism is an integral aspect of the self-actualization process. In the pursuit of authenticity, individuals may encounter skepticism or resistance from others who may not understand or appreciate their chosen path. It requires a steadfast resolve to stay true to one's convictions, even in the face of external judgment. Embracing constructive feedback is valuable, but the ability to discern between constructive criticism and baseless negativity is crucial for personal growth.

In essence, self-actualization is a journey toward becoming the best version of oneself. It transcends the superficial desires for popularity, power, fame, and money, emphasizing the significance of character in achieving genuine success. The courage to defy societal expectations, the commitment to personal principles, and the resilience to overcome criticism are integral components of this transformative process, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?

Nkosilomusa provided valuable insights into the Edoofa Scholarship Program, emphasizing the application process and the unique Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program, along with the financial aspects. 

In terms of the application process, Nkosilomusa highlighted the competitive nature of the program due to its widespread popularity. To expedite the process, he offered to assist in prioritizing the evaluation of submitted forms and securing an early career counseling session with an academic expert.

Choosing Edoofa over other agents and consultants, Nkosilomusa stressed authenticity and affordability. Unlike other options, Edoofa stood out by providing continuous support beyond admission, including assistance with accommodation, registration, and documentation. Nkosilomusa's personal experience at the airport, greeted by the mentor/Edoofa team, showcased the program's commitment to student welfare.

The core of the Edoofa Program lies in its Earn While You Learn (EWYL) initiative. Nkosilomusa explained that Edoofians participate in real-time projects from industry leaders, access internship opportunities, and attend live webinars with African CEOs. The unique aspect of this program is the ability to self-finance education beyond the initial scholarship by earning credits through project work.

Nkosilomusa shared his financial journey, highlighting a 50% tuition fee reduction based on merit, extracurriculars, statement of purpose, and recommendations from senior Edoofians. He stated that the fees will range from $1500 to $3000 per annum after the scholarship. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity to work on projects, earning scholarship credits each month. Some seniors managed to cover their entire $2000 cost through this initiative, serving as inspiration for others.

The involvement of parents in the process was underscored, with regular updates on the student's progress. Nkosilomusa emphasized the program's unique feature of keeping parents informed at every step. Beyond financial benefits, the EWYL program provides a platform to improve skills, expand networks, and collaborate with potential future employers.

In conclusion, Nkosilomusa's messages provide a comprehensive understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program, shedding light on the application process, financial aspects, and the transformative impact of the Earn While You Learn program.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Qualifying for a scholarship involves a combination of academic merit, extracurricular achievements, personal statements, and letters of recommendation. Demonstrating passion, commitment, and alignment with the scholarship's values enhances one's eligibility, making them a strong candidate for financial assistance. I believe I'm one of those students.
23/11/23, 10:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
I hope you are doing well. _*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Date: 23/11/2023*
*Time: 6:00 PM*
23/11/23, 10:15 am - +91 78886 93132: Noted ma'am.
23/11/23, 10:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Nkosilomusa. 
I am proud of you. ☺️
23/11/23, 10:19 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
23/11/23, 10:20 am - +91 78886 93132: Okay ma'am. I will be in touch with him.
23/11/23, 10:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, That will be great Nkosilomusa.
23/11/23, 10:29 am - +91 78886 93132: Ma'am, I tried to draft some messages which I will use to communicate with my students. Didn't I distort the sense and meaning?
23/11/23, 2:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Nkosilomusa, You don't have to send all the messages at once first. First of all, you need to start introducing yourself and what you need to know about the student. Then while explaining the Edoofa Scholarship Program to the student you need to incorporate these points into the conversations and not just copy paste the messages.
23/11/23, 2:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since we had our session yesterday, I wanted to dedicate the entire time to the session. Now, I am sharing your Lesson of the week today.  Make sure that you go through it and share your understanding by Friday.
23/11/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Wednesday lesson will delve into an exciting and essential topic: "The Power of Competitive Spirit: A Catalyst for Growth and Success."

In this lesson, we will explore how embracing a competitive mindset can be a driving force behind personal and collective achievements. We'll examine real-world examples that showcase the transformative impact of competitive spirit on innovation, resilience, and overall success.

Understanding the dynamics of competition is crucial in today's rapidly evolving world, whether you're navigating your academic journey, planning your career, or considering the broader societal landscape. This lesson aims to provide valuable insights and inspiration as we explore the stories of individuals, businesses, and nations that have thrived by fostering a competitive edge.

Come prepared to engage in thoughtful discussions, share your perspectives, and gain a deeper understanding of how the power of competitive spirit can shape our paths to success in our upcoming session.

Best regards,

Moving further, By the end of December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits than the same. <This message was edited>

02/12/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly join the call
05/12/23, 4:55 am - +91 78886 93132: In my EWYL program, I've invested my strength, time, and commitment with the expectation of receiving greater rewards. Along the way, I've faced numerous challenges—some overcome, while others still act as stumbling blocks. Despite investing energy in connecting with companies through internet searches and communication attempts, the response has been limited, with many showing disinterest.

I dedicated time to community building, engaging with applicants across various social media platforms. Unfortunately, these efforts resulted in no enrollments. Communication with headmasters and companies faced similar resistance. Despite the almost negligible output, I've gained valuable skills, including improved communication, professional writing, and interaction with diverse individuals. Patience, perseverance, commitment, and focus on my goals have all seen significant development. Additionally, I've honed networking skills, establishing connections with noteworthy individuals.

Through this experience, I've observed varied customer reactions to products or services, understanding that building trust and rapport is crucial. Being in the role of an agent or salesperson requires strategic approaches to win customers, fostering belief in the offered services. Despite the challenges, I plan to continue leveraging social media to reach potential applicants, even though a majority are already aware of the program.

Academically, I am constantly learning and experiencing new things, gaining insights into my identity and position in the business world's hierarchy. Participating in the EWYL program has provided me with valuable experiences, contributing significantly to my personal growth. Regarding my aspirations, I aim to leverage my skills in real estate marketing, earning the necessary resources for further entrepreneurial endeavors. Ultimately, I aspire to reach the pinnacle of the business world's food chain.
