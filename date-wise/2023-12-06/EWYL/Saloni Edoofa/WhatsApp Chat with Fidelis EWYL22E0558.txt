19/09/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
19/09/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
19/09/23, 1:57 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Looking forward
19/09/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
19/09/23, 1:59 pm - +265 992 71 08 82: Thank you
19/09/23, 2:04 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: It's Fidelis and parents. Is it supposed o be Fidelis only?

19/09/23, 2:06 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Alright
19/09/23, 2:09 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Thank you I am also pleased by having you as my mentor

19/09/23, 2:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: As for me not really
19/09/23, 2:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
19/09/23, 2:45 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Well noted with thanks
19/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 996 12 72 66: Please give us the highlight of the 2 objectives
20/09/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session⏳
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Am fine and yourself
20/09/23, 1:52 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yh let's proceed
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/09/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/09/23, 1:55 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Okay I now understand thanks
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/09/23, 1:59 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Thanks it will really be a pleasure working with all of you
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: They are also delighted and humbled to have you in the group!
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
20/09/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Oky for sure
20/09/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Nice to know saloni and I also believe that indeed together we can achieve big goals and am really honoured  having you as my mentor
20/09/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I assure you that we will be a great team together and I will try all by means that I can, I help you achieve all your goals and targets🎯
20/09/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes 20 is enough
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yh done reading it and I do agree that it's actually a good way of learning from the best 👌
20/09/23, 2:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, indeed it is a great idea.
20/09/23, 2:27 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Totally agree
20/09/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Fidelis?
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: It sounds very good 👍
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, and I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
20/09/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
20/09/23, 2:30 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes I am
20/09/23, 2:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
20/09/23, 2:35 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: For sure 💯

21/09/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you so much, Fidelis for this amazing explanation🤩
21/09/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
21/09/23, 2:04 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes it's clear
21/09/23, 2:04 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Thank you
21/09/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/09/23, 2:20 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yh I've just finished going through it and I can't wait to get started 🤞🏿
21/09/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that’s wonderful. Fidelis- I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
21/09/23, 2:34 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: This document is mostly talking about my earn while I learn program emphasising more on how it works it states that in the first step I research about my jobs In other words corporate aliances during this stage I'll find out how these thing work and do my research with the mindset of never giving up for it is hard to get a job this will be done online and when I find a job I will have to inform the edoofa board .Am also keeping in mind that every email being sent has to include seels @ edoofa.com .



And then there is project 2 which is about community building in this stage .In this step I mostly with people in the same area as me and we both have the same ambition I also have to gain much skill in persuading people for communication is a big factor in a community. 
To do this I have to apply forms to send to the edoofa board .I'll have to reach out and share about edofians too this is with the aim of influencing others that it is also  possible for them to learn abroad 


Both of these methods will help me gain credits which will be used to reduce the fees my parents will be paying
21/09/23, 2:46 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: So I guess will finish off tomorrow? <This message was edited>

22/09/23, 2:16 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Yes I've learned that in the first stage of corporate alliance I must identify companies in my country or region using my own personal links and tell them how the edoofa team is helping me to do this this will assist me in future employment after graduation. 

Then you need a LinkedIn account which I'll download on playstore and it will help me create a connection with the companies employers,manager and human resource officers .it will also help in setting  up meeting with them and the edoofa team to communicate effectively. 

And u also stated that u will provide me a document that has common asked questions

27/09/23, 1:58 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Everything was clear but then I just wanted to know what to do first
27/09/23, 1:58 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: As in should I influence my freind first
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
27/09/23, 2:15 pm - +265 998 31 73 56: Oky thanks

I hope you are doing well. 

Today, we're discussing the *importance of belonging to a community in our journey towards success.*

Belonging to a community, whether it's a family, a social group, or a professional network, can be incredibly motivating. It gives us a sense of purpose and a desire to contribute and be recognized. Communities provide a support system that helps us overcome obstacles, and they are rich sources of knowledge and expertise.

As we explore the significance of belongingness, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this topic and any project updates you might have. Please share your views and updates on the *EWYL Line*.

23/10/23, 10:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on Wednesday from 09:30-11:00 AM 😊 Please note that I won't be available today due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
23/10/23, 10:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra is a Hindu festival with its origins in India, celebrating the victory of good over evil. It is not directly linked to African festivals but shares the universal theme of triumph over malevolence. In diverse African communities, individuals from India or other regions may celebrate Dussehra alongside local festivities, fostering cultural exchange. Immigrants from India in Africa often continue to observe Dussehra, occasionally sharing these traditions with their local communities. While not intrinsically connected, Dussehra's theme of celebrating virtue resonates with the broader notion of triumph over evil found in various African festivals.

Hope you are doing well.

I want to extend my sincere apologies for my absence yesterday. I was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the grand orientation event that took place at one of our partner universities. It was an exhilarating experience, and the students displayed their enthusiasm by preparing some delightful surprises for us. This made the event truly worthwhile.
07/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I acknowledge that we missed our sessions last week and yesterday. To make up for this, I have scheduled a special 1.5-hour session tomorrow, during which we will cover all the material we had planned to address. Our session will begin at 09:30 AM and conclude at 11:00 AM. This extended session will help us catch up on everything and ensure we continue making progress as planned.
Also, from Thursday onwards, we will be beginning our preparation for our festival Diwali, therefore our session for tomorrow will also make up for for session that would have been held on Thursday. I am sure you will attend the same on the *EWYL Line tomorrow*
