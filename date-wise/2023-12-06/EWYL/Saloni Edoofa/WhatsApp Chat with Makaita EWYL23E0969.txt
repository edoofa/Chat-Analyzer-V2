Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.

How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
05/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Good afternoon
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes please

05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Makaita, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I want to attain a masters and EWYL program will assist in that because it reduces the burden of paying fees on my parents.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great because I am there with you on this journey and I will make sure you achieve these goals.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 245 5997: Good afternoon. Iam Rabson Mudavanhu, Makaita's father.
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Can you explain them please
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello sir, how are you doing?
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I understand
05/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 245 5997: I am very well, thank you and how are you?
05/12/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I read it
05/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
05/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 871 0042: With your assistance,he was able to maximize his gain from the EWYL program and he also acquired skills along the way
05/12/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, I am sure you will be able to score more and really high!
05/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
