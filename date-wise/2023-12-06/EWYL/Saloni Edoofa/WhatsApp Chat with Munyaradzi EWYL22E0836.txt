10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*

11/10/23, 3:36 pm - +91 78886 42825: Have you reached out to  Dilon Murove as the latest form that I have shared
11/10/23, 3:37 pm - +91 78886 42825: He's my first after such discussion of the $300 plan
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, we must have reached out to the student.

11/10/23, 3:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case of the absence of video, your forms will not be counseling, due to lack of video and therefore, you will not be considered for the $300 plan.
11/10/23, 3:45 pm - +91 78886 42825: That's noted
11/10/23, 3:46 pm - +91 78886 42825: For Delon what's next to do because the video you have requested it just now.

11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

23/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 531 3215: I have questions on guideline points numbers 1 and 4

On 1. Since both grant and scholarship cannot be redeemed both. Is there some instances when grant amount can be more than scholarship amount?

On 4 it's saying after successful completion of payment of fees. My question is if we pay all the fees how will the student benefit from the grant. Just like now we have paid $1075.00 balance is $300.00 for NEXT semester. If we had paid all of it $ 1375.00. how was the student going to benefit from the grant.
23/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 531 3215: Or other plans

I noticed you've already earned $155 and I have a vision to help you triple that amount. But, it'll only work if you're ready to team up with me daily for the next 30 days. Picture it as a journey where we work side by side, shaping a future that makes you and your parents proud and happy, ultimately securing that grant for you.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
25/11/23, 7:49 pm - +91 78886 42825: l learn the information  i get to let myself try in applying it. .According to Saturday Activity I aspire to be someone who sees opportunity and grab it by the neck.

A habit that i have done and made to envision myself everyday was that i got to think and set clearly my goals of what i call success.I aspire to be a Civil Engineer best of my time but i understand i have to be an indispensable asset to this world's knowledge.To achieve that i ought to act,carry,work and present myself differently of I don't want the normal desired outcome of success considered by 95% of today's youth.

In this field of study i understand it might be difficult to breakthrough and make an impact.One thing i am preparing myself for now is to be excellent in problem solving despite the task in my daily life.With this i know just and only one day I can develop and implement effective plans/solutions using my unique abilities.

Talking of obstacles I understand there is sometimes the need for team effort. Acknowledgment of the unknown information is the 1st step to opening up and accepting learning from other persons or sources.I think with this determination i will continue to plow through these hardships. 

As for now students work to have bare minimum in CAs, Mid-terms or End Terms but I myself I don't envision or strive for the same fight.
I only see a top way to greatness to which requires my best effort.
27/11/23, 4:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening Munyaradzi!
How are you?
27/11/23, 4:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I appreciate your thoughtful response and your clear vision for personal and professional growth. Your commitment to being an indispensable asset and striving for excellence in problem-solving sets you on a path to success.

It's commendable that you recognize the importance of continuous learning and the value of teamwork. Embracing the unknown and being open to learning from various sources will undoubtedly contribute to your development in the field of Civil Engineering.

Your determination to surpass the norm and aim for greatness is inspiring. Keep pushing yourself to achieve beyond the expected, and I have no doubt that your unique abilities and commitment will lead you to make a significant impact in your chosen field.
29/11/23, 11:46 am - +91 78886 42825: How are you Ms Saloni?
29/11/23, 11:47 am - +91 78886 42825: Thank you for the uplifting words to the soul.
29/11/23, 11:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Munya!
How are you?

I am doing well, thank you!
29/11/23, 12:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Time for today's Wednesday lesson, it covers a topic that is fundamental to your academic and personal growth: "The Power of Analysis: Unleashing Your Potential Through Input-Output."

Analytical skills are crucial not only for your academic success but also for your future endeavors in the professional world. This lesson aims to equip you with valuable tools and perspectives that will enhance your problem-solving abilities and decision-making processes.
