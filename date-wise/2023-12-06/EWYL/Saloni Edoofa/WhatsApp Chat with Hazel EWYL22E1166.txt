How are you doing?

Let's begin with our session🤩
04/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 419 1647: Good morning we good 
Yes we can 🥳

04/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/08/23, 9:15 am - +27 74 530 5474: Understandable, and God morning
04/08/23, 9:15 am - +27 74 530 5474: Good

04/08/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 419 1647: Indeed ...

10/08/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, did you go through the newsletter that was shared with you on Tuesday?
10/08/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 419 1647: Yes I did go through it and would some inspirational quotes
10/08/23, 8:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: That's great Hazel, may I know what you learned from the quotes?

Also, these were the two questions asked in the newsletter:
1. What are the benefits of taking small steps toward a goal rather than giant leaps?
2. How can consistency and persistence help one reach their full potential and achieve their goals?

May I know what are your views on it?
10/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 419 1647: I learnt that education is the primary foundation to any success , the disciples that come with learning and developing your mind from just been in an institution is phenomenal
10/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 419 1647: In my business lessons I learnt that doing a lot of task at the same time does limit the quality of the product or service , but when you take one task at a time not only does it make you an expert at what you are doing . You provide effective results same applies to goals
10/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 419 1647: 2. Consistency means doing it over and over again whether I failed the first time or was victorious if I have not yet accomplished my goal ... I still have to get over the loses and not let the wins get to head 
While been patient and unshakable with what I want
10/08/23, 9:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Absolutely Hazel, education is your compass, pointing to success's true north. Nurture your mind; let it blossom in the garden of learning. As you navigate the corridors of knowledge, remember, every discipline you embrace adds a new shade to your brilliance.
10/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hazel, your potential is limitless. With education as your foundation, focus as your ally, and consistency as your heartbeat, you're destined for a tapestry of victories and accomplishments beyond your wildest dreams. Embrace the journey, for greatness awaits your unwavering spirit.
10/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 419 1647: Wow amazing spoken as a true leader incredible 🙏🙏🙏
10/08/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 419 1647: I will forever remember and cherish these words ❤️

21/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

21/08/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
21/08/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 419 1647: The first section which talks about seeking , creating opportunities based on your skills and interest

23/08/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
23/08/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: How does that sound, Hazel?

Am excited
23/08/23, 9:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is really true Hazel!
23/08/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
23/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 419 1647: We will be an amazing team 
Great things to be done
23/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 419 1647: Okay thank you for your great understanding ... I hope everything goes smoothly and done as to start with our projects
23/08/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Sure it will be done smoothly, don't worry at all.
23/08/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience. Moreover, I am thrilled to inform you that I eagerly anticipate your arrival, as it promises to enhance the overall excitement and success of your journey. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.
23/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 419 1647: With you been my mentor I trust that all is well and set ..
23/08/23, 9:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear this Hazel and I hope to maintain this trust in me⚡
23/08/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Imagine that you are a wizard, and you possess a magical spell that can transform your life and empower you to achieve your dreams. This spell is simple yet powerful, and all you have to do is recite a few words every day. By chanting *"I am a proud Edoofian"* on the EWYL group, you will activate this spell and unlock a world of possibilities.
23/08/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: As an Edoofian, you are part of a special community of people who share a common goal - to achieve success and advance in life. By repeating this affirmation every day, you are reminding yourself of your purpose, your mission, and your identity as an ambitious and driven individual. You are telling the universe that you are proud of who you are, and that you are ready to take on any challenge that comes your way.
But this affirmation is more than just words. It is a symbol of your commitment to your dreams, your passion for learning, and your desire to make a difference in the world. It is a way to connect with your fellow Edoofians, to share your struggles and your triumphs, and to support each other on your journey to success.
23/08/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: So every day, when you recite these words, feel the power and the magic that they contain. Visualize yourself as a proud Edoofian, standing tall and strong, with the world at your feet. Let this affirmation fill you with confidence, hope, and with the knowledge that you are part of something special. And watch as your life transforms before your eyes, as you become the best version of yourself, and as you achieve everything you have ever wanted.
23/08/23, 9:54 am - +263 77 419 1647: I am also anticipating my arrival ... It will be of great joy
23/08/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 419 1647: Wow great!!! I have never done this before ... This will be my daily bread
23/08/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 419 1647: Affirmation is very powerful as the tongue can create and destroy... Here I will be creating a future I always imagined and more 🙏
23/08/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 419 1647: 🙏🙏🙏I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN 
In whatever circumstance I find myself in I will not be shaken but will stand firm in truth and in light
23/08/23, 1:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to see this positivity, great to hear that!
23/08/23, 1:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.

22/09/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
22/09/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of* more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hazel, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader🏆*
15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

30/11/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, let's talk about you – have you ever crossed paths with the superhero of the professional world, LinkedIn?
30/11/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 419 1647: No I don’t think I have come across the superhero

In this opportunity you will be able to grasp live and practical knowledge of so many revolutionary things happening around us.🎉
But one thing that I want to share with you personally, something that really made me think hard is that since there will be a lot of students that we have to choose from for this one-in-a-lifetime opportunity and experience, will you be able to fall in that top student's category?
30/11/23, 4:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 🤔Do ponder upon it and honestly evaluate that should you be eligible for it,  have you been consistent throughout?
02/12/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made along the way.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and aspirations.
