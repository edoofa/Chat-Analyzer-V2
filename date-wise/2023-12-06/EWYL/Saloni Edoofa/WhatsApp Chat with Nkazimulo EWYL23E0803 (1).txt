25/10/23, 8:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Nkazimula and parents, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Saloni* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.

How are you?
25/10/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delay in responding on Monday. Due to some personal reasons, I was not available post 11:30 AM on Monday and yesterday, the entire organization was celebrating Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉
25/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 644 3634: Good morning
25/10/23, 11:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: To fasten up our progress and to give you _my undivided attention_, I want to have our sessions at some scheduled time so that in that time slot I can pay all my notice and we can very soon move ahead.
I hope you don't have any problem with it.

Your session will happen from *01:30 - 02:30 PM* from Monday to Friday.

Please let me know as soon as possible so that we can resume our sessions.
Am I so excited, hope you are too💯
25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session📍
26/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 644 3634: I am fine
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why Nkazimulo was not present for the session?
26/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 644 3634: She is at school

27/10/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 027 9838: Yes
27/10/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well
27/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 027 9838: Thank you for being my mentor l really appreciate l hope and believe we will have good section together

27/10/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
27/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 78 027 9838: The one that has joined the group is my mother namely Sindisiwe Tshuma
27/10/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome her to the group, I am sure she  will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in you as we move ahead in this journey🚀
27/10/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 027 9838: Nop
27/10/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/10/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.

01/11/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
01/11/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

07/11/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, no worries!
07/11/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Nzakimulo?
07/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 027 9838: Great💫
07/11/23, 2:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
07/11/23, 4:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

what type of companies should l look for <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 2:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​

14/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 027 9838: Community building by helping:
African students to join Edoofa economic system and acquire education helping them in the future (motivated students)

15/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
15/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 027 9838: Noted
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
15/11/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Nkazimulo/Saloni/15NOV2023*
15/11/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
15/11/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
15/11/23, 2:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
15/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 027 9838: Noted
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
15/11/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
15/11/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
15/11/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Hope you are well.
17/11/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is a small motivation for the day from my side, 

"Embrace today with enthusiasm and purpose. Each moment is an opportunity for growth and achievement. Your potential is limitless, and every challenge is a stepping stone toward success. Be resilient, stay focused, and let your passion drive you. Seize the day positively, and watch how your efforts shape a brighter tomorrow.''
