15/09/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
21/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Let us begin
21/09/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Good day
21/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
21/09/23, 1:10 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
21/09/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on *Monday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*.
Till then, have a great day!
21/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Thank you.
25/09/23, 12:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

05/10/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session📍
05/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Sure
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Takudzwa will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
05/10/23, 12:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 298 7788: I have gone through the document
05/10/23, 1:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Takudzwa can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 298 7788: We are on the same page ma'am
05/10/23, 1:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Noted
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
05/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Then, if it's like that, let us wait for Takudzwa. He will be home at the end of next month .
05/10/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Takudzwa takes over her journey on the date you have mentioned regarding the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Takudzwa is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
05/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Understood
05/10/23, 1:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once done, let me know.
05/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Done
05/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Done
09/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Good day
I am ready for the session
09/10/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Takudzwa and parent!
How are you?
09/10/23, 12:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since you have completed the formality, therefore now I have put your EWYL Program on hold.
09/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Thank you so much.
16/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
