How are you?

If this is the case, then we can put your EWYL Program on hold till the time you are able to put your maximum attention.
17/08/23, 10:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
17/08/23, 10:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.

I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

How does that sound?

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
27/09/23, 12:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

07/10/23, 8:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Lydia can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
07/10/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 432 6077: Understood
07/10/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
14/10/23, 7:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?

16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I can understand that.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/10/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

17/10/23, 8:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Lydia and parents!

I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts on the same once you read it.
Even parents can do it on behalf of the student.
17/10/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 432 6077: The news letter does make sense and clears alot of doubts on my side dwelling on Henry Fords principle of " Giving value before seeking it".

 And I think the answer is twofold. Firstly, when you focus on giving value to others before seeking it for yourself, you're coming from a place of generosity and service. This creates goodwill and a positive relationship dynamic, which is beneficial for everyone involved. Secondly, when you give value first, you're often rewarded with value in return. So it's a win-win for everyone!
17/10/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: I wholeheartedly thank you for investing your valuable time in perusing our newsletter. Just as you've shown your support, we are committed to continuously delivering extraordinary newsletters from our side. Your engagement and enthusiasm are truly inspiring!

01/11/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: I'm excited to share some heartwarming stories of the interactions our officers have had with our students✨.

Thanks to the *collaborative effort between the Department of Student Welfare and the EWYL Program*, our students have not only excelled academically but have also shone in a plethora of extracurricular activities.

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

29/11/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 432 6077: The second project dwells more on pursuation skills and communication skills so as to be able to get other Students to join the Edoofa scholarship program and having to make them understand the now given opportunity to them by just joining the Edoofa program

30/11/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 432 6077: Noted👍🏽
30/11/23, 9:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
30/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 432 6077: Ok
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Lydia/Saloni/30NOV2023*
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
30/11/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
30/11/23, 9:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
30/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 432 6077: Should I create a New one I already have a group I Created The last time it's Lydia/Saloni/3 July 2023.
30/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 432 6077: Understood
30/11/23, 9:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, now need to create a new one. May I know how many participants are there?
30/11/23, 9:38 am - +263 71 432 6077: A few...Some exited cause they where told the registration is only available for the A'level students who are writing
30/11/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Lydia, we are open for admission for all the students, those who are in Form 6 as well as those who are in Form 5. So I am sure the number of candidates will increase automatically.
30/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 432 6077: Ok
30/11/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Any doubts that you have so far in the process?
30/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 432 6077: No doubts so far
30/11/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
30/11/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
30/11/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
30/11/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

01/12/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
