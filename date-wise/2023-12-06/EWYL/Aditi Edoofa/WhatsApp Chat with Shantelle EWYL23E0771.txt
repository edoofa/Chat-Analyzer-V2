17/10/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
17/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Yes please
17/10/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there is someone else who has joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
17/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Its my mom
17/10/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am pleased to meet her and I extend a warm welcome to her for the exciting and incredible EWYL journey.
17/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 849 6076: I'm done watching the video
17/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
17/10/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Shantelle, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
17/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok, my long term goals are, firstly I want to create a good name for my family and then to change how things work in my country. I want to make my country a better place to live in without fear of wrong doers or corruption
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Those are truly noble long-term goals. Establishing a good reputation for your family and working to improve the state of your country, making it a safer and more just place to live without the shadow of wrongdoing or corruption, are admirable aspirations. Your commitment to positive change is inspiring.
17/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Thank you
17/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
17/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 849 6076: No can you please enlighten me
17/10/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
17/10/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
17/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok I understand now
17/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
17/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok that's good
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Yes,  it does
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
17/10/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 3:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

18/10/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
18/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Yes it is
18/10/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 849 6076: It sounds great!!
18/10/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
18/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Yes please
18/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?

02/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok, the main aim is to get in touch with companies with potential that can collaborate with EDOOFA and willing to extend their help in the overall development of the students under EDOOFA. For easier picking, we must firstly look into the nature of the company.It should be either student -centric or recreational or be a content centric platform. Secondly, we must look at the scale of the company. It should neither be too big nor too small. Thirdly, its financial stability, the companies should be financially sound. Then, the background of  the founder, the founder should have a strong background.

02/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok, the Community Building is the process of strengthening relationships and sharing identities amongst individuals.

Preferred year of Admission:- 
(August 2024 or August 2025)
02/11/23, 3:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
02/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Great!
02/11/23, 3:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*SHANTELLE/ADITI/2NOV23*
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
02/11/23, 3:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 3:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Shantelle, we're concluding today's session, and please note that there won't be a session tomorrow because I'll be visiting one of our partner universities for the orientation program and I will share the pictures with you!🤩

02/11/23, 3:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you.

06/11/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
06/11/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

07/11/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Amazing!
07/11/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
09/11/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Shantelle, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success. Our next point of contact will be on the EWYL Line during your scheduled sessions.
09/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok, which is next week Monday right?
09/11/23, 2:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As we come to the end of today's sessions, I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity. You must learn about Diwali, light a candle on the occasion, and send me a photo of yourself celebrating it; I can't wait to see it!🤩
09/11/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will reschedule your Monday's session.
09/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 849 6076: Ok that's right

19/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 849 6076: OK, when I was still doing my O'level I had four friends. We used to do everything together, playing, studying, eating and many things best friends could do. We also would keep each other's secrets. Then one day in our class we were having an inclass test and the marks were to be seen by our Headmaster. My friends would not attend to classes regularly so they knew nothing when it comes to the test. I would ask them to come to lessons but they would say we are aware af what's being taught. My sister advised me that I shouldn't play with them but I just thought that she was being jealous coz we were quite close. 

Our teacher told us that the bench mark was 70% and my friends became scared. Then they decided to be absent for the test, they tried to convince me to go with them as well, and I was almost giving in to their temptations but that was when I realized that if I go with them I was going to ruin my future and also my sister would be very worried if she comes to know about this, and then I refused them and they went alone. Then when the marks were out and their papers were missing, they were taken to the Head's office and they were suspended. 

That was when I realized that, one must choose friends wisely, and what ever the situation may be one must be able to stand on their grounds and make decisions wisely without being forced or under anyone's influence.
