05/12/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Tinotenda, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 912 7152: My long term goals are like , I want a well paying job so that I can have a house of my own and also for my parents . I just want to live a normal life not depended to anyone but myself. The EWYL will help me in skill development and also having self confidence. It widens my mental horizon so that I will be familiar with a lot of things of the world.
05/12/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your long-term goals with me. It's commendable that you aspire to have financial independence and provide for yourself and your parents. Your desire for a well-paying job and a home of your own reflects a strong sense of responsibility.

I'm glad to hear that you recognize the value of the EWYL program in supporting your goals. Skill development, self-confidence, and an expanded mental horizon are indeed crucial aspects that will contribute significantly to your personal and professional growth
05/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 912 7152: Yes indeed
05/12/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 912 7152: No can you tell me about them
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 912 7152: Well noted
05/12/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 912 7152: Noted , I appreciate the great work they are willing to give me
05/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
05/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 77 912 7152: Yes
05/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

05/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 912 7152: Okay
05/12/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
05/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 912 7152: The newsletters are quite  inspiring and I have learnt a lot from them
05/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 912 7152: For sure one day I will be , I've noticed it and developed an interest in being part of it
05/12/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's amazing!
05/12/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
05/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 912 7152: Indeed
05/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 912 7152: That's sounds good and I can't wait..
05/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
05/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?

05/12/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation, and I can't wait for our next one.
05/12/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 912 7152: 1My EWYL team is like ; Ms Sanjana the head of the department and all group conversation, Ms Davis the head coach . and my mentor Ms Aditi
