I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:05 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
