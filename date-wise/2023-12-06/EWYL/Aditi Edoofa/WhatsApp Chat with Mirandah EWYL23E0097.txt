I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

https://meet.google.com/eqc-vjnf-xdf - here is the link to join the meet.
16/10/23, 4:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you, my student💯. Here are the pointers for your help.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

23/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, good evening!🌸
Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
23/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 90567 10073: Yes Ms Aditi
23/11/23, 3:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am delighted to discuss with you the proceedings of the grant, the one that you received from our esteemed founders, Mr. Angad Singh & Mr. Avreen Singh during their visit to Zambia. I hope you recall the event that I am talking about.
23/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 90567 10073: Yes , I recall the event.
23/11/23, 3:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me start this session by asking you about the importance and understanding of the Grant. So are you ready?
23/11/23, 3:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 90567 10073: Yes
23/11/23, 3:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant months ago?
23/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 90567 10073: Yes ma'am
23/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know your perception about it.
23/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 90567 10073: The grant is an opportunity for edoofain to be able to sponsor the education and relieve their parents from the stress of having to pay fees <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your consistent dedication and commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion. The title you have is not just a recognition; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
23/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 90567 10073: Thank you and I appreciate it
23/11/23, 3:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you remember the announcement that was made by Mr. Angad Singh where he expressed the importance of being connected with the EWYL program and ensuring at least 75% of your engagement in all the opportunities, sessions & activities that would be provided by your mentors. You have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them and earn the highest amount of scholarship credits. You have the capability to not only earn credits far exceeding the grant value but also, completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
23/11/23, 4:01 pm - +91 90567 10073: Noted and am thankful for having a mentor like u who is patient and understanding.
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words.
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - +91 90567 10073: Does this mean that my tuition fees for the next semester will be reduced
23/11/23, 4:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 90567 10073: Am done reading
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.
23/11/23, 4:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

23/11/23, 4:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

24/11/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, good evening @919056710073 !🌸
I hope your day is going great.

I am here to continue our discussion where we left yesterday.
24/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 90567 10073: Sure thing
24/11/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Mirandah, this discussion also involves your parent's participation, may I know if they are available at the moment?

24/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great.
Just let me know once there is a response from their side.
24/11/23, 2:43 pm - +91 90567 10073: Sorry but they are not online
24/11/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright.
Once they are online, make sure that they go through the conversation once they are online and share their thoughts with us in this group.
24/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 90567 10073: Sure thing
24/11/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - +91 90567 10073: Yes , I can recall the guidelines
24/11/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.


The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
24/11/23, 3:06 pm - +91 90567 10073: Understood
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible. 

As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
24/11/23, 3:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at: <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - +91 90567 10073: Noted
24/11/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	        4/6
Attendance	3/6
Orientation	Absent
Fee status	Clear
24/11/23, 3:16 pm - +91 90567 10073: Noted
24/11/23, 3:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.


Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 
A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B)Self financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 90567 10073: I am ready to self finance my education
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attending them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.

Before I move ahead, May I know if you have any questions that you would like to ask?
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - +91 90567 10073: No question
24/11/23, 3:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
24/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 90567 10073: I am ready to put 100% effort into this. And with u as my mentor, it is possible
24/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is wonderful, Mirandah. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $300 per year and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now is $20. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
24/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 90567 10073: I appreciate it and thank you
24/11/23, 3:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
24/11/23, 3:40 pm - +91 90567 10073: Yes , I am
24/11/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, I trust you've reviewed my earlier messages. I'd appreciate it if you could discuss your understanding of them with me tomorrow. Currently, you're not eligible, but you're on the brink of eligibility. My primary goal is for you to earn scholarship credits beyond the grant amount. To facilitate this, I'd like to schedule a special set of classes for you as I know that you have the potential. I'll share the timetable with you shortly.
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 90567 10073: Sure thing
24/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!

Also here is the Saturday Activity of the week,

As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL
