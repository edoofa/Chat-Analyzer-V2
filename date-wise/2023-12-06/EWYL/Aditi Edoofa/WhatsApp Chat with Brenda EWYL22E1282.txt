I would appreciate a response on my above messages as I can see that they haven't been acknowledged.
13/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 730 5904: I was in a quiz ma'am l am sorry

13/10/23, 12:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Though how was your quiz?
13/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 730 5904: The quiz was good though l didn't  manage to score all marks but l did very well
13/10/23, 12:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's great to hear that you found the quiz to be good, even if you didn't score full marks. Doing well on a quiz is still an accomplishment, and it's a positive step towards improvement. Keep up the good work, and you'll likely continue to make progress!
13/10/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 730 5904: Yes ma'am l look forward to score all the marks, l am working on it
13/10/23, 12:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am sure that you will, keep working hard!

13/10/23, 12:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb! That's the spirit.
13/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 71 730 5904: The only challenge l am having is the way we should write our exams, they need something  like 10  pages and the time is only 1hour 30minutes
13/10/23, 1:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand that taking exams with a limited time frame can be challenging, especially when you're required to write a substantial amount. Here are some tips that might help you manage your time and write effectively during such exams:

Plan Your Time: Allocate the available time for each section of the exam. For example, if there are multiple questions, decide how much time you'll spend on each one. Stick to your time plan to ensure you have enough time for all questions.

Be Concise: While 10 pages in 1 hour and 30 minutes is a significant challenge, focus on quality over quantity. Make your points clear and concise. Avoid unnecessary repetition or elaboration.

Prioritize Key Information: Highlight the most important information in your responses. If you're running out of time, it's better to have a well-explained central idea than to include less important details.

Practice Time Management: Practice writing under time constraints to improve your speed and efficiency. This will help you get used to the pressure of timed exams.

Stay Calm: Try to stay calm and composed during the exam. Stress can affect your performance. Take deep breaths if you start to feel overwhelmed.

Remember that practice and preparation are key to performing well in timed exams. The more you practice, the more comfortable and efficient you'll become at writing under time constraints.
13/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 71 730 5904: Thank you ma'am l will try to do as you say, l have been highlight  important  points and explain them shortly, they said you should  explain for at least 5lines giving examples and those 5 lines are only for 2marks
13/10/23, 1:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You're welcome and I would suggest you to go as per your university's guidelines on writing these examinations.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help to create a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

a) Your  journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

15/11/23, 6:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL
