16/08/23, 3:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:14 pm - +91 89684 49416: Yes maam am ready
16/08/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - +91 89684 49416: Am glad to hear this
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:16 pm - +91 89684 49416: Yes maam thank you
16/08/23, 3:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:17 pm - +91 89684 49416: Its a dream come true for me l wanted to win the 21day challenge all thanks to your free mentorship
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:18 pm - +91 89684 49416: Woow

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I hope you are doing well.
I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 12:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

09/11/23, 12:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here are the pointers for your help for your new task to creat a 1-2 min video of yourself.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

15/11/23, 4:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Also here is the Saturday Activity of the week,

As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL

I hope you are doing well. _*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Date: 27/11/2023*
*Time: 7:00 PM*
27/11/23, 1:33 pm - +91 89684 49416: Noted

27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +91 89684 49416: Yes maam am curious
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 89684 49416: Yes l recall maam
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 89684 49416: Incase of my grant being revoked scholarship credits l earn can redeem it
27/11/23, 3:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 89684 49416: Okay
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 89684 49416: I have noticed that
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 89684 49416: Okay maam
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 89684 49416: So am l one of them

27/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 89684 49416: Okay maam
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 89684 49416: Ok
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 89684 49416: Yes maam l am aware
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

Criteria	September + October
Webinar     	5/6
Attendance	4/6
Orientation	Present
Fee status	CLEAR
27/11/23, 4:00 pm - +91 89684 49416: Ok
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - +91 89684 49416: Okay maam
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 
A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +91 89684 49416: Ok
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - +91 89684 49416: Thank you.maam
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - +91 89684 49416: I will try my level best not betray your trust in me

27/11/23, 4:51 pm - +91 89684 49416: According to me ,the spirit of competition it is a great motivation like it compels you to become a better version  of you  .IT is one the things l think leads to success at time because it pushes you to do better,put more focus ,develop new idea infact being innovative and stay positive.For example as for when l was still a high school student seeing my cousins going to international  universities to attain their degrees l felt a spirit of competition awakened inside me ,here l am today doing my bachelor of honours at an international and well reputed private university .However,at times it diverts one from his or her passion to do other things that he /she dont have passion with .It is more like pressure at times .
27/11/23, 4:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your perspective on the spirit of competition as a powerful motivator and catalyst for personal growth is insightful. It's interesting to hear how, as a high school student, witnessing your cousins pursuing education at international universities sparked a competitive spirit within you. This drive has clearly led you to where you are today, pursuing your Bachelor of Honours at an esteemed international university.
27/11/23, 4:56 pm - +91 89684 49416: Yes maam

I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 89684 49416: Yes maam
28/11/23, 4:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $150 per year and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $3.6. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
28/11/23, 4:02 pm - +91 89684 49416: Okay maam
28/11/23, 4:02 pm - +91 89684 49416: Thank you

30/11/23, 4:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 4:15 pm - +91 89684 49416: What is the plan
30/11/23, 4:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
30/11/23, 4:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This
30/11/23, 4:15 pm - +91 89684 49416: Okau

30/11/23, 4:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.

04/12/23, 2:15 pm - +91 89684 49416: My journey in the EWYL programme had been an amazing  one. Even though I have faced network challanges  in the process, I have also managed to learn a-lot in-terms of skills and gain a-lot of knowledge. With the help of my mentors I have managed to get help which is  useful in the foreseeable future. 
I have faced challenges in the Community project.The  faced problems included  failure  to convince students to be interested in the programme. However, with the $300 plan from my mentor, I have been taught how to effectively talk to students and be able to convince them to. In short, I have been taught communication skills. I have also been taught marketing skills. 
Through the EWYL programme I have also been taught how to persevere through all challenges that may come my way in everything that we do. One of the most wednesday wisdom lesson that has highly impacted on me was the one of considering fauilure as a lesson and fuel that drives success.
I was also taught that hard work always pays out in the end through stories of other successful leaders like strive Masiwa that have been shared with me by my mentor. This pushed me to work harder and for sure this proved to me that hard work surely pays off. I was awarded a grant worth $450 This kept me motivated to work even harder.My life has been completely changed socially and economically with webinars ,my dreams and hope have been awakened . With this much motivation I am going to keep on working hard every chance I get. All thanks to my mentors for her dedication she always make me stay in the right track .
