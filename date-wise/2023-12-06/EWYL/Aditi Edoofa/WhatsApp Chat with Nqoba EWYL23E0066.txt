I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

12/08/23, 12:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

25/11/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello @917838224974 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,
Team EWYL

27/11/23, 1:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Afternoon @917838224974 , 
I hope you are doing well. _*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Date: 27/11/2023*
*Time: 7:00 PM*
27/11/23, 1:40 pm - +91 78382 24974: Afternoon ma'am

Okay will connect at that time
27/11/23, 1:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/11/23, 3:29 pm - +91 78382 24974: Good evening
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, good evening!🌸
Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yess ma'am
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:40 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes I am very curious
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yess  $250
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 78382 24974: Continue my proud edoofian rituals
Attend sessions n webinars
Work on my EWYL lessons
27/11/23, 3:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yess maam
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yesss maam
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yess ma'am I understand
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yesss maam i understand
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

Criteria	September + October
Webinar	        4/6
Attendance	2/6
Orientation	Present
Fee status	CLEAR
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 78382 24974: Ma'am in September my mentor was miss Tenzin and i attend sessions with her
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Nqoba.
So in the month of September, you were present in one session, and in October you were present in one session with me.
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - +91 78382 24974: Okay
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +91 78382 24974: Okkkyyy ma'am
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes I am  ready
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are wrapping up this session and we will continue this exactly from where we left.
So we will meet for this chat session *tomorrow at 7 PM*.🚀
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - +91 78382 24974: Okay ma'am thank you
28/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 78382 24974: Good evening ma'am  am ready for the session
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Evening 🌟
Hope you are well,

Are you ready for your grant Session?
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes I am
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.

My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yess ma'am I understand I will  have to learn managing and balancing my programs with Edoofa and school
28/11/23, 3:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is great!
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents to the fullest_
28/11/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $250 per year and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $110. <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes maam it is very clear and i understand
28/11/23, 4:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Witnessing your current progress and the credits you're earning is truly inspiring. It gives me confidence that you have untapped potential that can truly turn the tables in your favor. I firmly believe in your ability to reach greater heights.
28/11/23, 4:09 pm - +91 78382 24974: Thank you so much I will work to my fullest potential
28/11/23, 4:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: By actively engaging with the mentor through sessions and calls, you have the potential to earn more with every coming academic year. You have the capability not only to alleviate the current financial load but also to pave the way for a future where education becomes a self-financed journey. This isn't just about credits; it's about empowering you to shape a brighter educational and financial future and that I believe, is incomplete without consistent communication and consistency.
28/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 4:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We're concluding this session now, and we'll pick up right where we left off. Let's reconvene for our chat session tomorrow at *5 PM.* 🚀
28/11/23, 4:34 pm - +91 78382 24974: Okay thank you
29/11/23, 1:30 pm - +91 78382 24974: Good evening ma'am am ready for the session

29/11/23, 1:32 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yess maam
29/11/23, 1:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 1:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
29/11/23, 1:37 pm - +91 78382 24974: I have gone through it
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So do you think it's achievable?
29/11/23, 1:39 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes ma'am with hard work and consistency it's achievable
29/11/23, 1:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am eager ro know your plan of action now on the $300 Plan i.e. the community building project.
29/11/23, 1:44 pm - +91 78382 24974: Well I was thinking of sharing my group link to my social media platforms hoping to find people who are interested in the program
29/11/23, 1:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's a great idea.
29/11/23, 1:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you in touch with your juniors back in Africa.
29/11/23, 1:49 pm - +91 78382 24974: A few but most of them are already edoofians
29/11/23, 1:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So you can try and contact their other friends, right?
29/11/23, 1:52 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes I can try and do that
29/11/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, and also you can take your parents help.
29/11/23, 1:53 pm - +91 78382 24974: Will definitely do so
29/11/23, 1:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
So may I know your parent's profession?
29/11/23, 2:04 pm - +91 78382 24974: My mother is a teacher 
And my father is Sales Representative
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
So certainly you can take your mother's help in regards of reaching out to students from her school, right?
29/11/23, 2:06 pm - +91 78382 24974: Well she is a primary school teacher
29/11/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: But she might have access to the teacher's group in which there must be teacher's from Secondary school, right?
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes i think so
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
Buckle up and start working on getting forms of good students who are genuinely interested in studying here in India for their Higher education.
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Aditi Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
29/11/23, 2:09 pm - +91 78382 24974: Yes ma'am will definitely do that
29/11/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
29/11/23, 2:10 pm - +91 78382 24974: Thank you so much
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As our grant sessions wrap up, let's gear up and dive into the projects to earn those well-deserved scholarship credits! Get ready for an exciting journey ahead!
