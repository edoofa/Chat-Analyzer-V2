20/11/23, 9:13 am - +91 86994 62595: OK ma'am
20/11/23, 9:13 am - +91 86994 62595: So how much time does this process take actually
20/11/23, 10:29 am - Aditi Edoofa: Charmaine, it totally depends on your University.
20/11/23, 11:11 am - +91 86994 62595: Oky
21/11/23, 1:33 pm - +91 86994 62595: Ma'am I asked Dr Aarti regarding the my credits she said she didn't receive any email or transaction from edoofa
24/11/23, 1:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Charmaine!
Hope you are well.


Certainly, there is a discrepancy that I've recently discovered, and I want to assure you that I'm actively addressing it. There was a difference in your credits compared to what was indicated on other records. I've taken the necessary steps to rectify this, and I assure you that the matter will be resolved by the end of the week. I am committed to ensuring that you will receive the accurate credits by the end of the month.
24/11/23, 1:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And also please excuse me for the delay in reply as there were some technical glitches on my side.
24/11/23, 1:16 pm - +91 86994 62595: Greetings ma'am
24/11/23, 1:16 pm - +91 86994 62595: You mean by month end
Because it's been a month now without any action
24/11/23, 1:18 pm - +91 86994 62595: OK it's fine
24/11/23, 1:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, Charmaine. I appreciate your patience here, however, just to re-iterate administrative and governmental processes usually require a little more time than usual because there are finances involved. I have personally ensured that yours doesn't take any more time than usual. To shed more light, if you ask your batchmates or other fellow edoofians, you would know that we do not allow credit redemption in the odd term semesters and it usually takes place in the even term.  I have always considered you as somebody with whom I see an immense potential to grow and become successful, I am on top of your query of credit redemption.
24/11/23, 1:31 pm - +91 86994 62595: OK ma'am but I have applied to redeem my credits last semester with Mr Maurice but nothing worked.. Even now ahh
24/11/23, 1:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I know but Charmaine as a new mentor I didn't have any such information right, the day you told me I was trying to get it done for you, I hope you will understand that it will take some time, please have some patience
24/11/23, 1:34 pm - +91 86994 62595: OK ma'am
24/11/23, 1:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you Charmaine. <This message was edited>

28/11/23, 9:01 pm - +91 86994 62595: I'm doing well and you
29/11/23, 11:36 am - +91 86994 62595: Ma'am any progress
05/12/23, 1:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Charmaine!
How are you?

Certainly, first and foremost, I apologize for my delayed response as I wasn't around for some time. Regarding the update, I want to inform you that we've communicated with the Quest Authorities. They mentioned that the fees are not due at the moment. However, we are actively working to ensure that your credits are adjusted accordingly.
05/12/23, 1:17 pm - +91 86994 62595: But I have a remaining balance for my fees
05/12/23, 1:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on it?
05/12/23, 2:04 pm - +91 86994 62595: Ma'am I have a pending balance of about 75 now and it's due 10th December
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - +91 86994 62595: And I want to know who said my fees are not due for now because I have a pending balance. I even asked Dr Aarti to give me some time and days so I can clear it
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - +91 86994 62595: Let me ask Dr Aarti about it
05/12/23, 4:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure!
