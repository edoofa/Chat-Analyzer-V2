I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Ratidzo may face some difficulties in attending our session due to school activities. I kindly request both you and Ratidzo to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
02/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. Almost all of the student's parents have already completed their admission process for the 2024 intake, which puts us behind schedule by 2 Months now. I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. However, I would only requires one hour of your time for our session, and with pure consistency, we can easily wrap it up during that time frame.
02/11/23, 2:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I would like to inform you that there are certain opportunities awaiting your admission process that will be of great help to your finances. This opportunity has been greatly appreciated by your fellow peers and their parents, and I would not like you to miss out on it as well. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.*
