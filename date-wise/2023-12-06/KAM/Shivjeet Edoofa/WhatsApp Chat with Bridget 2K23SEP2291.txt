11/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noticed that you mentioned the date in the EWYL form as november. I would like to let you know that you can indeed proceed with the EWYL session once you are available and ready for the session.
11/10/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect your exams, which are scheduled to begin on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, you can enhance your study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit your performance in the upcoming exams.

However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled, that parents can actively participate in. 

This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. hence, if you are occupied with school, on your behalf they are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program
11/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Thank you sir

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
13/10/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
13/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes they are
13/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
13/10/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
13/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes I am
13/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
13/10/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Noted
16/10/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. I am glad that you have noted the step 6.

19/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Summary of videos 

First Video:
- Students should be open minded 
- Students follow  instructions
- Students should have a teachable spirit 


2nd Video 

- Edoofa's vision is not just to get students quality education but to also increase Student's capacity for success, thus making them responsible and independent
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Third Video 

Edoofa has invested large amounts of time in finding good schools, colleges and universities for passionate edoofians. The founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and qualify for these prestigious institutions
19/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes I am available, sir
19/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Fourth Videos 

Students should be diligent in filling out the Statement of Purpose form and be prompt to take action
19/10/23, 3:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I shall wait for the summary of the first video.
19/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 71 380 7287: I have sent it sir
19/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
19/10/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
19/10/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
19/10/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Noted
19/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
19/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
19/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

May I know by when you might be available for that?

As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
31/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 380 7287: No, everything is clear
31/10/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
31/10/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
31/10/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students.

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
02/11/23, 5:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.

02/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
02/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
02/11/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes
02/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 380 7287: It does
02/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?

03/11/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student. I hope you are having a fine evening today. 

I would like to let you know that I will not be available this evening due to an unforeseen event that just came up, requiring my immediate attention. In order to make up for this session, I shall now be scheduling our session for tomorrow morning from 8:30 AM onwards. Please excuse me for the inconvenience. Have a great evening, and please share my warm regards with your lovely family as well.
04/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 380 7287: Morning how are you sir
04/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 380 7287: Yes we can proceed
04/11/23, 11:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking.
04/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts. <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
04/11/23, 11:30 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
04/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 380 7287: No , l have understood everything very well
04/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for your time during the session today. It was a great session, and I'm hoping to have the same in our future sessions as well.

However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, today is the weekend, and my available hours are ending soon a little early today. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
07/11/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed this hed led s to a delay in your admission process which might have led to losing out on the opportunities waiting for you. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
07/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Sorry sir, l have been facing network challenges, as the power cuts here have become severe
07/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 71 380 7287: I'm now available for the session
07/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
07/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes. Last time you had explained the registration fee payment can be split into two parts over a 30 -45 day period
07/11/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
08/11/23, 6:31 am - +263 71 380 7287: Please do enlighten me about it
08/11/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to further connect with you by the time that you reached out as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
08/11/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 380 7287: I am now available sir
08/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
08/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 380 7287: No l am not aware of it. Please explain it to me
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Noted
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Noted
08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
08/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes I am
08/11/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
08/11/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?

09/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Bridget!

I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and will be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 12:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

17/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear. I am happy to hear that.
17/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
22/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Good evening sir. I'm ready for today's session
22/11/23, 5:31 pm - +263 71 380 7287: We last discussed about, the 3 options a student will be left with, if they fail to attain required results to pursue their desired program
22/11/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct . 
Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

22/11/23, 5:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
22/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 380 7287: No ,everything is clear on that
22/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
22/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes, l very much excited about this
22/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
22/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

01/12/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from MVN University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
01/12/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
01/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 380 7287: 1.$350
2.$0
3.$1600
4.$250
5.$1000
01/12/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes it is
01/12/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $375
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
01/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1625.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1625 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1875.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1625. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?

I hope you are doing well and excited as the weekend is just around the corner. As for me, this weekend, I have committed some extra hours for my students today, starting a little early with the intention to close early as well.

Therefore, I wanted to check if you are ready to proceed with our session today and complete it, allowing you to have the weekend for yourself to enjoy with your friends and family.
02/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes l am available
02/12/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Regarding my above message, there has been a slight error in the calculation 

Here tuition fee mentioned is $350, not $375. Which led to a change in the next calculation of the fees as well. This gives you the accurate per annum cost of $1600 and your first-year cost of $1850. Could you please let me know if you are getting my calculations?
02/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes l am
02/12/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education. <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
02/12/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being active today with the session.  For further process let us proceed with our session from Monday as it is the weekend our available hours have ended. Have a great weekend and warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Bridget. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in discussing your offer letter. I understand that there might be some challenges that you are currently facing, which has led to this inconsistency, and as your admission officer, I am always ready to help you out here. If it's the timing of our session, you can also let me know so that we can schedule our session at your convenience to complete the discussion of your prestigious offer letter. <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 1:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, as we continue to face these inconsistencies in our sessions, you may end up missing the deadline for the offer letter, potentially losing out on the same. If that happens, I would not be able to help you. I want you to secure this offer letter to make your future dreams come true, as it has been my sole responsibility since I became your admission officer. So, if you are facing any challenges, please let me know so that we can find a solution and proceed with the detailed discussion of the offer letter and plan your finances together.
05/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Afternoon sir
05/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 380 7287: I'm available for today's session
05/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Bridget. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Could you please let me know if you are facing any challenges that is leading you to this certain inactivity?
05/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes, the network has been down for the past few days
05/12/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I completely understand the network issues causing the inactivity. It's a situation beyond our control but crucial for our discussions. Hence, May I know if you are now  comfortable to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes l am
05/12/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
05/12/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
05/12/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes it does
05/12/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
05/12/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
05/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Thank you sir
05/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes l am
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 12th, 2023*.
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
05/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes please
05/12/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me here. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *December 12th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *January 12th 2024, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
05/12/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before December 12th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
05/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes we are
05/12/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
05/12/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
05/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes l am
05/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
05/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
05/12/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
05/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Noted
05/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Noted
05/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
05/12/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
05/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 380 7287: Yes please
05/12/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi

05/12/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
05/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 380 7287: No l have no queries, everything is clear
05/12/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, in that case, let me share a few insights into MVN University with you -
