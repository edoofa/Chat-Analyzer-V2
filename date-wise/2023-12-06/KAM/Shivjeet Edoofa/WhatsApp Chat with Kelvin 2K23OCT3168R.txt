29/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

04/12/23, 6:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Kelvin!

I am great thank you for asking. How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 393 9614: We are well sir and how are you and how was your weekend
04/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It was great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session?
04/12/23, 6:35 pm - +263 77 393 9614: Yes we are ready
04/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 393 9614: Yes we do understand that but if that happened what will you do to help us so that we are left with one
04/12/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is indeed we will be there to guide you through the same. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 883 6494: Yes we have discussed about it
04/12/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1600 to $2300 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 883 6494: Yes we are on the same page
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1800 per annum
04/12/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/12/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 883 6494: Yes we have taken note of it
04/12/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1800 as per the above example.
04/12/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1800 - $1000= $800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $400 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/12/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 883 6494: Yes I have understand the whole idea
04/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
05/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 707 4506: Good evening sir
05/12/23, 7:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 883 6494: Yes we are ready
05/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 707 4506: Yes
05/12/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 883 6494: We are very sorry today our network is very low
