I must say, your family, must be proud of you and must be working towards providing you with the best opportunities to kick-start your career.

On that note, may I know how your counseling session with your counselor went and what did you like most about the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far?
21/08/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 911 4587: My counseling session went well and what I have liked the most about Edoofa scholarship program is that it offers the chance of having reduction in tuition, it offers students a chance to mingle with others from different countries and also it helps the student reach their desired goals.

22/08/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
22/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I'm ready
22/08/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I'm done
22/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
22/08/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
22/08/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes these two are clear
22/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/08/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/08/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes these are clear too
22/08/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/08/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes these are clear also
22/08/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
22/08/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes we can proceed
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
22/08/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
22/08/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 911 4587: The first video has it that one has to be open minded to achieve success and also one has to follow instructions. It is also discussing on the life of independence of students through the EWYL
22/08/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the other videos.
22/08/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 911 4587: This caters for students to be open minded on the road to achieve your goals. It also discuss about the affordability of the education through the scholarship. The vision of Edoofa is of taking a person's success to whole capacity.
22/08/23, 7:06 pm - +263 78 911 4587: This caters for quality education institutions. Edoofa provided checkpoints which check on the credibility of various universities which will take the students for learning. This ensures that students get quality education
22/08/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 911 4587: The SOP will be scheduled by the founders. Students get a chance to apply and qualify for chosen universities due to their ability to showcase their abilities. The students have to show skills and knowledge of their purpose
22/08/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
22/08/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
22/08/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
22/08/23, 7:27 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes that was my understanding
22/08/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
22/08/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Ok we can move forward
22/08/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
22/08/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

23/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 911 4587: A prosecutor is a criminal lawyer hired by the government to represent the interest of the government in any criminal trial. A prosecutor leads investigations and decides which inquiries the police should make. The aim of the investigation is to identify a suspect and to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to file a prosecution. How long an investigation takes will depend on the complexity of the offence, the willingness of the suspect to cooperate and the available evidence.While lawyers have the duty of reasonable diligence in advocating for their clients’ interests, they are not obligated to press for every possible advantage on behalf of their clients. One limit on the extent of a lawyer’s advocacy is the duty to only present meritorious claims and contentions to the court. This means that a lawyer may not initiate a proceeding or assert or defend a claim unless there is a basis in law and fact supporting the claim which is not frivolous.
23/08/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 911 4587: I would like to venture into corporate law. This is so  because I will have the chance to work with those who are in business and I will be helping them to run their business smoothly as this will help me acquire the experience to run my own law firm as it is my dream to own one. 

Corporate practice gets you very close to the business world. Sometimes, especially after you become a partner, the line between being a legal advisor and a business advisor becomes blurry because you will have some good clients who trust you so much that they will discuss with you about many things beyond legal.

However, while you get to work on these large transactions, you might not feel like you’re making an impact until later in your career.

Corporate law is a type of law that oversees business management, operation, and formation. In choosing this career  I can impact the big players of the business world in various industries and specializations. 

A good corporate lawyer sees both the forest and the trees, and understands how they connect together I chose corporate law because I view a business as a complete system, not as a series of meaningfully distinct parts. 

Also not leaving the issue of payment as working for companies is paying especially in the legal part. A lot of companies want people who stand for them when it comes to their financial issues and their properties.
23/08/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 911 4587: I've some skills which make me suitable for being a lawyer. Firstly I am associative, I can interact well with different people. This makes me eligible for the law business as it requires a person who can talk to his clients in order to get the truth of what transpired to the cause of the certain issue I will be handling. Secondly, I'm a good listener and I take time to process and I think critically on what one says before giving an answer and I think this makes me eligible because I have to listen and give the best help I can to my client. I can also work under pressure and I have the capacity to work in a small space of time. I once did my building project which is supposed to run for six months in two months because I received the project very late but I managed to finish it in time and submitted it. Lastly I am a natural born leader. I've been selected my peers in different categories at different times. Currently I'm the headboy at my school and I have the eligibility of leading my peers into doing what is required especially what is best for them and the school at large so this will help me if I start my own law firm which will be running under a good leader.

23/08/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tavongashe.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the academic interview questions and the academic documents it is duly noted with us. May I know if you were able to submit the SOP form, since we are unable to go through your response in our records, could you please try and fill the form again?
23/08/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Good afternoon
23/08/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I've submitted the SOP now
23/08/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
23/08/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
23/08/23, 12:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelors of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
23/08/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Alright we can move on
23/08/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes that's it
23/08/23, 12:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
23/08/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes I'm ready
23/08/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
23/08/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
23/08/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
23/08/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes its not practical
23/08/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
23/08/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
23/08/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
23/08/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes it was discussed
23/08/23, 12:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
23/08/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes it is understood
23/08/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
23/08/23, 1:21 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes it is
23/08/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
23/08/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes I'm following and its understandable
23/08/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
23/08/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 911 4587: The fee that I was asked to pay before is the one that will be added to the registration fee or the registration fee is independent
23/08/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand your query. I believe what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee which is $350, and the $750 registration fee that you are referring to is a one-time payable fee that is a part of your first-year university tuition fee and is not an additional cost to be incurred by you. It is required to be paid once the university issues your offer letter. 

I hope you are clear now?
23/08/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes we are clear now
23/08/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
23/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Ok that is noted
23/08/23, 1:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great day.
23/08/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Thank you
23/08/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

08/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Welcome we can go ahead
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I hope it will work
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 4:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 796 7976: 1. 900 dollars  2. 5 years.    3. 300 dollars.   4.
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the first 3 responses, may I know if you were able to get the answer for the 4th response as well?
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 796 7976: 750 USD
08/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 796 7976: The weather is rainy here. So we may experience network interruptions
08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, I completely understand that such weather conditions can interrupt our communication and I appreciate you connecting with us despite the challenges.
08/11/23, 4:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Yes l am made to understand that l pay 900 dollars twice a year for the 2 semester for tuition fees
08/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 4:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 5:00 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Understood
08/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Yes its clear. However kindly clarify on accommodation payment modalities on both situations. Is it a once off payment
08/11/23, 5:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please let me help you understand @263777967976 if a student prefers to stay on- campus then the $2000 has to be paid all at once and this amount is the annual cost which includes food as well. However, this cost is expensive for the students and parents to incur, and hence all our Edoofians prefer to stay off- campus since off- campus is cheaper and even allows the students to cook for themselves, and for off - campus the cost can be paid on a monthly basis since you would be directly paying to the landlord.

May I know if this answers the queries you had?
08/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Explicitly answered
08/11/23, 5:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that your concern has been answered. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
08/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Quite clear on that one
08/11/23, 5:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 5:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Yes we're together. Kindly complement the 15 day period for registration and the NB that is requesting for submission of A level results before registration and that else the admission will be cancelled. Note that the student in question is currently sitting for A level exams whose results will be out between February and March 2024
08/11/23, 5:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your queries I will get back to the deadline shortly let me help you understand the second query first. Now, if you recall our previous conversation For a student to secure a 50% scholarship he/she will require at least 2E passes. However, let me draw your attention to the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of the Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school. 

In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.

May I know if you are satisfied with the explanation so far?
08/11/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Yes we can go ahead
08/11/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now coming back to the deadlines. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a *$150 grant* applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Please go ahead
08/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 5:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 796 7976: True. Following keenly
08/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Not quite so. I'm 60km away but I frequent Harare regularly
08/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 6:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Thanks you are welcome
08/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 6:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 796 7976: You are most welcome
08/11/23, 6:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you would like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Sure kindly do so
08/11/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
08/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Noted
08/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
08/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Yes l understand
08/11/23, 6:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
08/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
08/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
08/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
08/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 796 7976: True I do
08/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
08/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
08/11/23, 6:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
08/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 796 7976: That's good
08/11/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that he will dedicate himself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of his education while balancing his academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
08/11/23, 6:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
08/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 796 7976: I'm done. Thanks and be blessed
08/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that have no queries. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
08/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
08/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
08/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).

08/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 796 7976: Quite exciting
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
08/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
08/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Tuesday 14th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
08/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We will be connecting on the 14th since we have one of the biggest festivals coming up Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
08/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 4:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tavongashe.

I hope you are doing well. As we were to connect today on the 14th, I have scheduled our discussion today at 08:00 pm CAT, I hope you will be available to connect with us at that time.
14/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Good afternoon. We can connect at 08:00 pm
14/11/23, 4:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please l am looking forward to connect with you today at 08:00 pm today.
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Good evening. We can connect now
14/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
14/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Yes we did
14/11/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
14/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 911 4587: My family is putting effort to secure money for the seat and everyone is happy for the place
14/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
14/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 911 4587: Regarding off campus residence. Are the residence close by the university
14/11/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263789114587 Let me help you understand your concern here. The accommodations are situated near the university, and they are safe. In terms of transportation costs, it is very convenient as they are very close to the university. It will either be within walking distance or a short ride on local transport for a quick and easy commute, which will not cost you more than $10 per month if students want to stay a bit further away from the university. Please let me know if this is clear to you as well?
14/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 911 4587: It is clear
14/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
14/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 911 4587: I'm yet to get a better internet access
14/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
14/11/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
