I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA. LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024.

16/10/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. BA. LLB stands for Bachelor of Arts in Legislative Law.
16/10/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes Ma'am that's the course he wants to study
16/10/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

16/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
16/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Jus as the image explains it. You get acceptance letter from Edoofa. You pay the 388us that's required.  You get a statement of purpose.  Then counseling sessions on how you are going to go about it . The  tell you how they will assist you the best way the can.  They tell you about the earn while you learn program . They tell you the money you will pay and the university costs as far as Edoofa beneficiaries are concerned.  They help you apply to the best universities and guide you all the way until you get a place.
16/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Mainly batsirai deals with all the other counselling sessions that have to do with all the stages  I mainly deal with the fees aspect   . My apologies on the little information that l know
16/10/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?

18/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 845 9184: It's ok maam
18/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Good evening ma'am
18/10/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening to you too, I am happy to connect with you again today.
18/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I'm ready to start. Though Batsirai has been doing all the sessions on his own . We are trying to help him to be responsible and independent and show his dedication to this program.
18/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 845 9184: We were hoping that when he is finished his exams he will would continue with his sessions on his own so that he will be up to date and fully responsible for every step of his course
18/10/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see your enthusiasm for Batsirai.  I understand, however, due to the exams he will not be able to connect with us, and we have a piece of exciting news to share with you. So we want to connect with you. So may I know if you are ready?
18/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I'm ready ma'am
18/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes we are ma'am
18/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I ve reviewed them ma'am
18/10/23, 7:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Batsirai, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 71 845 9184: This is great news ma'am
18/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yoooh this is great news. The current financial situation in Zimbabwe is hard to get by and a fees increase would be very hard for us. So this is a relief to us as a family.
18/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I'm yet to understand this ma'am.
18/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 71 845 9184: We ve to pay 150us then the remaining 600 will be paid when??
18/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 845 9184: The grant meaning  Edoofa will pay 150us ??
18/10/23, 8:16 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Sorry ma'am pliz explain on this in simpler terms
18/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 845 9184: How much are required to pay in in how many days or months?? Is it the one that you said 30 to 40 days
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you understand @263718459184  the registration fee as discussed above is $750 this registration fee through the Endowment program, Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf and you will only be required to pay $600 to reserve your seat with the University.
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Also, please understand that this registration fee of $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
18/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Ooohh ok that's great
18/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes now it's clear
18/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes ma'am now this is clear
18/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I as a parent lm not bt lm sure bstsirai knows it
18/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 71 845 9184: What is quantum ma'am
18/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Kkkk maybe l know it but now lm not familiar with this English word
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
18/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/10/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 845 9184: True ma'am
18/10/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/10/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Very clear ma'am
18/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/10/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Very clear
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Ooohh ok
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Not at the moment
18/10/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Batsirai's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process?

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

07/11/23, 10:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 4:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Batsirai,

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
08/11/23, 6:47 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you doing?? Sorry we had no electricity hence my phone was off. Batsirai had gone for his exam
08/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Thank you so much for all the hard work you are putting in on our behalf
08/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I read a bit and have a few questions pertaining the hostel fees
08/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. That is alright, please we can discuss it now. I understand that he must be occupied with his exams, surely we can discuss them.
08/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
08/11/23, 7:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
08/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 845 9184: It's ok ma'am. Please do
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
08/11/23, 7:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s Batsirai per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of his course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
08/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 063 8661: 1) 900usd
2) 5 years (10semesters)
3) 300usd
4) 750usd <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response, may I know if you could check for question 1 again and answer the tuition fee after scholarship?
08/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Sorry Ma’am I corrected it
08/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Yes Ma’am
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
08/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
08/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Thank you Ma’am for making that more clearer
08/11/23, 7:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
08/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Yes Ma’am it does 
Thank you
08/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
08/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Yes we are clear Ma’am
08/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
08/11/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 22nd, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
08/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Yes I can understand Ma’am
08/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes ma'am. We are. My question is the 750us. We have to pay all of it in the 15 days stated ???
08/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 845 9184: On our last sessions l had a different understanding pertaining the payment processes
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand this better. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
08/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Also on this... this is the first offer we have had,  is there any chance that we can change to another university better rankings let's say in the event that he passes his A levels
08/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
08/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
08/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotia's University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
08/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 845 9184: It's clear ma'am. Bt now we have a 15 day period.  How do we go about it , if we need to wait for other universities to respond
08/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you explain better @263718459184. 

As you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotia's, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotia's and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
08/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 845 9184: No ma'am lm not please kindly help me out
08/11/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
08/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Oooohh that's better.
08/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 845 9184: In India you have universities in which form. Eg private institutions and government institutions
08/11/23, 8:13 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I saw that Galgotias is a private institution or l got it all wrong
08/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please Galgotias is a private institution, and do not very at the end of our discussion we will be helping you with the insights as well. Please I would encourage you to be a little patient so that I can help you understand the offer letter better.
08/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Ok sorry ma'am. Old age is getting to me . Please do proceed
08/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 22nd, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 22nd, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
08/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 22nd, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
08/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 71 845 9184: It is clear maam
08/11/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
08/11/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
08/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 845 9184: We will take the offer of paying in installments  first 300us then the rest in December
08/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes we live in Harare
08/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
08/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
08/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Ok ma'am thank you
08/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
08/11/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
08/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
08/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 71 845 9184: We will discuss with the father and will  advise tmrw bt lm sure we will use Mr Charles
08/11/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
08/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Now l understand maam
08/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
08/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
08/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
08/11/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
08/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes maam
08/11/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
08/11/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
08/11/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
08/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
08/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
08/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings may I know if we are still connected?
08/11/23, 9:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!
09/11/23, 10:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Batsirai.

09/11/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
09/11/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
09/11/23, 12:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 14th of November which is Tuesday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
09/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Ok ma'am
09/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 845 9184: It is ma'am  thank you
09/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. We will be connecting on the 14th since we have one of the biggest festivals coming up Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 12:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?

14/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Well Ma’am the University is beautiful and I’m pretty sure I will learn though we are hoping for other Universities to send offer letters so that we can be able to choose depending on the university’s rankings
14/11/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require.

Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
14/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Yes I did Ma’am and  I couldn’t find any new information that you hadn’t given me and I’m grateful to you
14/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's fantastic to hear! As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
14/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers. 

If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.
14/11/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

14/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Thank you Ma’am 
Will do
14/11/23, 8:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 22, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
14/11/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Not yet Ma’am my parents are still discussing about that
14/11/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, may I know by when will you be able to update me with the same?
14/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 063 8661: If you would be so kind to give us 3days  Ma’am I’m sure I will be able to come with an answer
14/11/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please in that case, we can connect on the 17th of November 2023, may I know if it is suitable for you?

18/11/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
18/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 063 8661: Okay Ma’am hope you fully recover
18/11/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
20/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Batsirai!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:19 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you?? Hope fine. We did bt we ve got a challenge.  Batsirais father gets paid on the 26th so now our due date is 22. We wanted to pay 300us this month then the other 300us next month to cater for the 600 University admissions fees
20/11/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Thank you for sharing your challenge with us in that case, I completely understand that, could you please help me understand how much have you been able to raise till now for Batsirai's registration fee and how much will you be able to raise before the first deadline? This would help me assist you better.
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I will only be able to get the full payment at once on the 26th of November.
20/11/23, 5:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that.  I understand that However, you know the universities are also restricted with the due dates that they share with the students considering that there are only a limited number of seats and they have to be fair to each and every student. I would love to help you out here, however, I will only be able to help you and talk with the academic board regarding your case since your concern is genuine for that I would have to know your preparations and confirmation that you will be able to deposit the $300 without fail on 26th of November?
20/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes sure ma'am. Definitely
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that. Alright, please, thank you for sharing the confirmation with me here. Now, on that note, please write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Ms. Kirti about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention the date and amount that you will be able to pay $300 on 26th of November 2023.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.

21/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Batsirai,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if we can connect now and continue with our discussion?
21/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you doing?? We managed to send that email today
21/11/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share the screenshot of the same?
22/11/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Batsirai.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you ma'am??  We are still communicating
22/11/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Will send soon
22/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 063 8661: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the screenshot, we have taken note of it, and we will connect two days before the 26th of November to understand your preparations.
22/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Ok maam
22/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great evening ahead.
27/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Batsirai.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you since as per our previous conversation you were to make a deposit of the first part by 26th, may I know if we are connected?
27/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you doing. It is with great disappointment and a broken heart that lm sending this message ma'am.  Unfortunately my husband said He will not be able to pay for batsirais fees. We could  afford the fees but we have realised that he will be needing hostels fees. If he is staying off campus that means he will need transport and food allowances.  We cannot afford it. We also need to take into consideration the visa and travelling costs so we will be looking at a large amount.  We are sorry to say that we have to withdraw from the program.  We are very very sorry ma'am.
27/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and I completely understand that you have these concerns, and these concerns are very genuine and common for many parents, if I had been at your place I would also had the same concerns. But you know you have to understand the actual figures, the understanding that you have right now as per the concerns you have shared. I believe you have misunderstood the financial requirements. And for that, I am here to assist you always, let me help you here.
27/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If we are talking the off-campus accommodation at Galgotias University is $800 per annum and that not only includes your rent but also your food and basic expenses such as water bills, electricity bills, and Wifi costs, when you talk about the transport, the off-campus accommodations are all situated near to the university within a walking distance in that case, you do not have to incur the transport fee at all, if a student wishes to stay at an accommodation far from the campus which takes 5-10 minutes time through the local transport then also the cost would be near to $10 per month. If this is the reason why you think you will not like to continue your child's education toward his career goals then I don't think that is a wise idea.
27/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Secondly, you mentioned the visa and traveling cost, @263718459184 when you talk about the visa and traveling cost it is a one-time investment for the student if, in the near future, you would make Batsirai study in Zimbabwe or anywhere else, in such case also, you would be incurring the transportation charges to send him to the university, right? The only change here is here, if you invest in this cost it would give you higher returns because of the quality of education provided here, more over the visa and travel costs are something that is not to be incurred every year, just a one-time investment towards to better career for you child which makes him much closer to grow his career, and will be open to better opportunities so do you not think that invesment is worth it, because at the end the result will your child at a better position to support you in the coming future?
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Oooohh if that is the case then it's reasonable.  We were thinking that we would need to send money every month for his upkeep and that is beyond our means.  Our other concern is the ranking of the university that has offered him a place. We know his Olevel results are not good but we are confident in his Alevel results. If we can get another university with a higher ranking even if it means waiting for his A level results.  The current university that has offered him a place is below the ranking of our university of Zimbabwe.  Something above the education qualification of the universities in Zimbabwe will be idea for us.
27/11/23, 4:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see your perspective, however, Galgotias is recognized for providing quality education and is without any doubt better than the education standard of the University of Zimbabwe. While perceptions can vary, I am certain that the facts are something we both can rely on. Hence, I want to ensure that you have accurate and detailed information.

Could you please share who mentioned that the quality of education at Galgotias University is not good? Additionally, if there are specific concerns or factors influencing this perception, it would be helpful to know. This information will enable me to address your concerns more effectively and provide you with the necessary details to make an informed decision.
27/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Noone mentioned this maam. I jus checked on the Internet
27/11/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Galgotias University ranked 203rd in India, 4652nd in the global 2023 rating, and scored in the TOP 50% across 25 research topics. Galgotias University ranking is based on 3 factors: research output (EduRank's index has 4,403 academic publications and 21,504 citations attributed to the university), non-academic reputation, and the impact of notable alumni.
University of Zimbabwe is ranked #1190 in Best Global Universities. Schools are ranked according to their performance across a set of widely accepted indicators of excellence.
27/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Maybe l was miss informed by that information hence my previous concern when l asked whether or not he will be able to change universities if he scores better points on his A level results
27/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand what you are trying to say, could you please let me know from which site did you go through these rankings? I understand your concern regarding the rankings of Galgotias University. However, it's important to consider the context of university rankings both nationally and globally.
27/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Allow me to clarify further. In Zimbabwe, there are many universities, and the University of Zimbabwe holds a respective position among these the total number of institutions. However, in India, where Galgotias University is located, there are more than 1000 universities.
27/11/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias holds a commendable position among these numerous institutions, ranking 52nd according to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), a reputable ranking body in India. This ranking signifies Galgotias' standing among a significantly larger pool of universities compared to the situation in Zimbabwe.

To provide additional assurance, I'd like to share a screenshot of the NIRF rankings with you for a clearer understanding.
27/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: These rankings help indicate Galgotias' academic standards, infrastructure, faculty expertise, and overall educational environment. I hope this information alleviates any concerns regarding the university's standing?
27/11/23, 7:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, I will help you understand this concern of your as well, once you are able to go through my above messages.
27/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Yes l understand ma'am.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now coming to your second concern. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
27/11/23, 7:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 71 845 9184: It's clear maam
27/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
27/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 71 845 9184: I understand that ma'am. But the problem is with my husband.  He doesn't want to take the first offer that has jus come along.
27/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I understand and that is why the transfer option will be helping you here. Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
27/11/23, 11:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, so l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
27/11/23, 11:55 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Sorry had dosed off it's midnight now in Zim.  Goodnyt will resume in the morning
28/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Batsirai.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you doing?? Hope fine. Will be free at 6:00pm
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great thank you for letting me know that, in that case, I shall be waiting for your response at 06:00 pm today.
28/11/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 12:37 am - +263 71 845 9184: It's ok ma'am  . I have understood everything that you have said . But l think will pass the first offer. We hope that we will get offers from other universities or rather we can wait until his A level results are out for we are certain he did well and those results can get him a place at a better university
30/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Batsirai,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you yesterday. Towards the end of this month, we were occupied with back-to-back meetings with the university officials, closing the current round of admissions for the Endowment Benefits given to the students for the remaining 37 seats.

With the right efforts of the students, all the seats have been filled, and there are only two seats left. The students who are able to complete their admission process tomorrow might be able to benefit from the same. While we wished for all of our students to benefit from this, the students had their own financial preparations, and hence the students who were proactive were able to benefit from this.
30/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the opportunity of discussion with the university officials, I personally connected with the academic board and the university officials, believing that we can share the concerns that have been highlighted by you and help you understand their perspectives as well.

Let me share the brief of the conversation we had with them so that you too can share your experience or thoughts with us, and we can help you with your university admission process the right way.
30/11/23, 12:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To summarize the decision for your ease, we brought up the financial concerns that were highlighted by you early on. Since they understand the challenges you have and wish the best for you, they mentioned that is the reason they have approved the extension and allowed you the flexibility of the payment plan as well. However, now that the student has raised another concern regarding the university ranking, it has left the impression that the student is not serious about the application but rather has come up with another concern since that was not highlighted early on.
30/11/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this, they also mentioned that Galgotias University is one of the leading universities in India. If the student is comparing the quality of education with the University of Zimbabwe, they probably are not understanding the right metrics. In such a case, it is the loss of the student. The academic board understood the perspective you had, they agreed with the university's perspective and mentioned that the student is not focusing on the bigger picture. If the student is focusing on the ranking of EduRank, which is not reliable in the first place, the student is focusing on the employment opportunities in Zimbabwe and not on a global level. Galgotias University has a record of ensuring that 98% of their students have jobs before they graduate and they are able to earn more than $8000 per annum as a graduate.
30/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Whereas the universities in Zimbabwe cannot work on such metrics, and that is the reason students are traveling abroad to get access to better quality education.

This is also the reason Galgotias University was recommended to the parent because it is one of the universities that ensure that the cost of education and the quality of education are balanced in a way that the student is able to focus on their career and makes the right decision. 

Being an International student, the only reliable source you have is the Internet, and that is the place where anyone can comment on anything and nothing can be verified. But being Indians, we are connected with the education ministries and receive updates on the universities and the merits they have directly from them.
30/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Considering the student's excellent records, the universities are recommended. If in case, the parent feels that the recommendations shared by the academic boards are not in their right interest, I believe the student is not seeing Edoofa as their guardian but rather as an agent that should help them with an offer letter and not help them make the right choice in their conscious mind.
30/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is something that raised concerns for me as well because this is what we were trying to help the student understand. Though we do not have much time on our hands, I have requested the admissions team to allow us time until the 15th of December so that we can have a detailed discussion regarding this and then move forward. As your admission officer, I want the very best for you, and I feel that we need to have a detailed discussion on this if you wish to make the right choice. Hence, I have shared the feedback on what we discussed, and now I wish for you to go through this and give me an update at your earliest tomorrow and then we can discuss further.
30/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 845 9184: Hello ma'am how are you doing?? Thank you so much for the effort that you putting in it is greatly appreciated.  As parents we had an idea that we would 3 to 4 offers of university then we would pick from those rather than just getting one option.  We are also considering our child's result and we know there are not the best. Bt he faced a few problems when he wrote his O levels. But we are certain that his A level results will be recommendable and we are hoping that he will get the best opportunity for a better university there in India hence the hesitation to jus accept the first offer.
05/12/23, 2:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Batsirai.

I trust you are all in good health. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner, as I was not feeling well. Thankfully, I am on the road to recovery now. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in clarifying a matter that has left me somewhat confused. Initially, there was a mention of extending deadlines due to financial constraints, but the recent communication seems to contrast this earlier point. I find myself a bit confused and would be grateful if you could provide some further insight to help me better understand the situation?
