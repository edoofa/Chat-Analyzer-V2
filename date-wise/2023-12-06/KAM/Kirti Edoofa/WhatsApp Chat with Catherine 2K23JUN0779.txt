09/09/23, 9:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Catherine,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Catherine's higher education?
12/09/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 303 1875: Hello Ms Kirti and the Admin 
Im sorry to tell you that Catherine is now winding up her Studies in preparation for her final high school examinations and she won't be available up until the 16th of November when she finishes.
Until then im available to answer to what beyond my knowledge.

As for  Her Higher Education yes we are planning towards that day in day out.
17/10/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Catherine.

24/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 3:51 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Good afternoon ma'am I have read the above and understood
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
24/11/23, 4:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
24/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Sorry ma'am we did not have network but tommorow we will be available
25/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, with regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to continue with our discussion ahead may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
25/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am I am
25/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
25/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am everything is clear
25/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
25/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
25/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am I have read and understood
25/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
25/11/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
25/11/23, 2:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
25/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 318 4079: This is a nice scheme for paying I am following up thank you
25/11/23, 3:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 318 4079: No ma'am please provide
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/11/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok maam I understand
25/11/23, 3:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end a little early today as it is the weekend. Let's reconnect on Monday and continue this session. Have a great weekend, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
25/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Same to you ma'am and thank you for the time have a blessed weekend
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 4:57 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes maam i am available
28/11/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So may I know if you are clear so far?
28/11/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am we are
28/11/23, 5:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am
28/11/23, 5:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
28/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes I agree
28/11/23, 6:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, since it was my dinner break and since we will not be available to continue with our discussion let us reconnect tomorrow during the day time which is at 12:30 pm. Have a great evening ahead.
28/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok maam
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 318 4079: Morning ma'am because of Network I was unable to connect but things are ok now we may continue
01/12/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Catherine.

I hope you are doing well, that is alright please I understand that network can be a challenge, however, if you are available now we can connect and move ahead with our discussion.
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Sorry ma'am I was traveling but I am stable now
01/12/23, 6:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that completely may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/12/23, 6:03 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Ok ma'am I understand
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
01/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
01/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 71 318 4079: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 6:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program.

Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?

01/12/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
