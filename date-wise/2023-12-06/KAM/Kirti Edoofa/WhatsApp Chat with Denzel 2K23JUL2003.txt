For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/08/23, 8:31 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess Sir lets start
01/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 636 6773: You can explain now Sir @917292063289
01/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/08/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/08/23, 8:47 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Very clear Sir
01/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/08/23, 8:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/08/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Oky that's good
01/08/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 636 6773: I understand
01/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 636 6773: I am following Sir
01/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/08/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/08/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 636 6773: We are very much clear Sir
01/08/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/08/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yes Sir let's do so
01/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
01/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

01/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

01/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
01/08/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
01/08/23, 9:28 pm - +263 71 636 6773: By 2300  i will be done
01/08/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please take your time, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 PM.
01/08/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Okay Sir @917292063289 


Good night
01/08/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you, have a great night.
02/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Good Afternoon @917292063289 .I have gone through the videos and i really have acquired great information regarding Edoofa and all the processes one has to go through.

So firstly i have heard that inorder for everything to go well in the admission process one needs to be open minded and must follow all the instructions accordingly.

Edoofa's aim is not just get student's affordable education  but  to increase student's capacity for success , making them more independent and responsible.

Edoofa has spent much time in order to come up with the best Colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians and student's should be well prepared,creative and open minded inorder to widen their chances of being enrolled into one of these colleges.Above all following instructions is the major course to get  one's self a place.

Students should be ready and able to fill the Statement of  Purpose since it is an important document.The  Statement Of Purpose is  a document which convinces any school why  a student is worthy of a  scholarship into their school.The student must display his/her goals , achievements and also their vision and the reason why they're seeking admission into that particular school.
02/08/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Denzel. 

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
02/08/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
02/08/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
02/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yess  i have understood that very well
02/08/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Good afternoon @917292063289
02/08/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
02/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Oky  Sir @917292063289
02/08/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Today at 09.00 pm.
02/08/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

03/08/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
03/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 636 6773: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Question 2
Entrepreneurship and economic development have a significant relationship, with entrepreneurship playing a crucial role in driving growth. 

One way entrepreneurship contributes to economic development is through job creation and employment opportunities. Entrepreneurs establish new businesses, which in turn generate employment, reducing unemployment rates and improving the overall economic well-being.

Furthermore, entrepreneurship fosters innovation and technological advancements. Entrepreneurs are at the forefront of developing new ideas, technologies, and products, enhancing productivity and the competitiveness of a nation.

Additionally, entrepreneurship promotes competition in the market. New businesses compete with existing firms, resulting in increased efficiency, lower prices, and higher quality products and services. This ultimately benefits consumers and stimulates economic growth.

Moreover, entrepreneurship attracts investment and contributes to capital accumulation. Entrepreneurial ventures are often attractive to domestic and foreign investors, fueling economic growth. Successful entrepreneurs also reinvest their profits, leading to further capital accumulation.

Lastly, entrepreneurship can drive regional development by establishing businesses in underdeveloped or rural areas. This brings economic activities, infrastructure development, and employment opportunities to these regions.

In conclusion, entrepreneurship plays a vital role in economic development, creating jobs, fostering innovation, encouraging competition, attracting investment, and promoting regional development.



Question 3 
GAAP, an acronym for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, refers to the standard framework used by businesses for financial accounting and reporting. It encompasses rules, principles, and guidelines that govern the recording, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial information.

The significance of GAAP lies in its role in ensuring consistency, comparability, and accuracy in financial reporting. Adhering to common accounting principles enables companies to provide reliable and transparent financial information for stakeholders, such as investors, creditors, regulators, and the public. This facilitates informed decision-making regarding the financial status and performance of the company.

Additionally, GAAP reduces information asymmetry by providing a standardized approach to financial reporting, enabling investors and creditors to compare financial statements of different companies. This fosters transparency and minimizes the risk of misleading or manipulative financial reporting practices.

Moreover, GAAP serves as a solid foundation for auditing processes, with external auditors relying on the consistency and accuracy of financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate the fairness and reliability of the information provided.

In summary, GAAP acts as a crucial framework for financial reporting, ensuring transparency, comparability, and accuracy in presenting financial information. It promotes trust, confidence, and effective decision-making among stakeholders in financial markets.

Question 4
Accounting standards are rules and guidelines established by accounting standard-setting bodies to guide the preparation and presentation of financial statements. They provide a uniform framework for reporting financial information, ensuring consistency and comparability across companies and industries.

These standards are mandatory and serve several purposes. Firstly, they enhance the reliability and transparency of financial reporting by providing consistent rules for recording, measuring, and presenting financial transactions. This reduces the risk of manipulation and boosts stakeholder trust.

Secondly, accounting standards facilitate comparability, allowing investors, creditors, and regulators to assess the financial performance and position of different entities. This promotes efficiency in decision-making and improves the functioning of financial markets.

Additionally, accounting standards assist in the interpretation and enforcement of accounting regulations. Regulators and auditors use them as a basis for assessing compliance, ensuring proper disclosure, transparency, and adherence to applicable laws.

Lastly, accounting standards contribute to the harmonization of financial reporting practices globally. Having common standards facilitates cross-border investment and trade, fostering consistency and understanding.

Overall, accounting standards are mandatory to ensure consistency, comparability, transparency, and reliability in financial reporting. They promote stakeholder trust, aid decision-making, and harmonize financial practices internationally.


Question 5
Accounting and auditing are distinct but interrelated disciplines in financial reporting. Accounting encompasses the recording, classifying, summarizing, and interpretation of financial transactions and events. It entails preparing financial statements like the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement, which provide insights into a company's financial position, performance, and cash flows. Accounting follows established principles like GAAP or IFRS to ensure accurate and consistent financial reporting.

Auditing, on the other hand, involves examining and verifying financial statements prepared by accountants. It entails an independent assessment to determine if the financial information presents a true and fair view of the company's financial position and performance. Auditors review accounting records, internal controls, and supporting evidence to assess the reliability and completeness of financial statements.

Accounting focuses on the preparation of financial statements, while auditing assesses their reliability and accuracy. Accountants record and present financial information accurately, whereas auditors provide an independent evaluation of financial statements' compliance with accounting principles. Both disciplines are crucial in ensuring the integrity, transparency, and reliability of financial information. Accountants play a role in preparing accurate statements, while auditors provide assurance and maintain confidence among stakeholders in the financial reporting process.

04/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
04/08/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of commerce for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
04/08/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess Sir
04/08/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
04/08/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yes Sir i am ready
04/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
04/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
04/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/08/23, 10:00 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess i agree
04/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
04/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
04/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
04/08/23, 10:03 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yes he did and i understood pretty  well
04/08/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
04/08/23, 10:06 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess very well  @917292063289
04/08/23, 10:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
04/08/23, 10:08 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess Sir it is very clear and understood
04/08/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
04/08/23, 10:09 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yes i am following
04/08/23, 10:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
04/08/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 636 6773: No i don't have any so far
04/08/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
04/08/23, 10:18 pm - +263 71 636 6773: I will gladly inform them about everything.

Thank you @917292063289
04/08/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night and weekend ahead.
04/08/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Wish you the same @917292063289

21/10/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 619 9320: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 619 9320: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 619 9320: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your academic documents, may I know if you or your father is available to connect with us ?
21/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 619 9320: I am available
21/10/23, 10:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yeah i have recalled
21/10/23, 10:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
21/10/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 619 9320: The registration process for university admission involves researching universities, completing and submitting the application form, providing required documents, paying the application fee, meeting deadlines, waiting for verification, receiving the admission decision, and following enrollment instructions if accepted. It's essential to review specific instructions from each university and reach out to their admissions office for any clarifications.
21/10/23, 10:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
21/10/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 619 9320: None for now
21/10/23, 10:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/10/23, 10:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
21/10/23, 10:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 619 9320: This is quite good news
21/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 619 9320: 😊😊 very  well I'm elated
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/10/23, 11:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
21/10/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 619 9320: I have understood everythin ,clearly
21/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/10/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
21/10/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Denzel, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
21/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 619 9320: 😊wow this is so exhilarating
21/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 619 9320: I understand
21/10/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/10/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/10/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yessss
21/10/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/10/23, 11:21 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/10/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yes
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/10/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yes i have understood very clearly thank you
21/10/23, 11:26 am - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 619 9320: No I'm not familiar
21/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/10/23, 11:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
21/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yess i have understood now
21/10/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yess
21/10/23, 11:36 am - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yess i agree
21/10/23, 11:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/10/23, 11:40 am - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/10/23, 11:43 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yes
21/10/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
21/10/23, 11:44 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 619 9320: Yes
21/10/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/10/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 619 9320: Understood
21/10/23, 11:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 619 9320: No let's  proceed
21/10/23, 12:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yess
21/10/23, 12:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/10/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky i  can't wait

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yes i have gone through it thoroughly
15/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 619 9320: It's my pleasure thank you @917292063289
15/11/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 619 9320: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yes let's proceed
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 619 9320: 1)$900
2)3 years
3)$300
4)$750
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yess it's clear
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Noted @917292063289
15/11/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky that is quite understandable
15/11/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yes I'm clear
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yess we are together
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yess explain
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

Message after acknowledgment
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yess understood very clearly
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 7:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 619 9320: I reside in Chinhoyi
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky Thank you
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Thank you 

Contact saved
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi Innbucks for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 619 9320: No Thank you
15/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky clear on that one
15/11/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me share, just incase, you may need. Here are the *Mukuru account details*

15/11/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky noted
15/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Understood @917292063289
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yess very well
15/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 8:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 619 9320: How many offer letters do i receive?
15/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263786199320 as of now your application has been accepted by Galgotia's University once we receive an update from other universities I shall let you know.
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
15/11/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).

15/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please  before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
15/11/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?

15/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 636 6773: I would like to have a chance to receive from LPU 

It'll be my  greatest pleasure
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263716366773 Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. Since you mentioned LPU we have taken your recommendation under consideration as well
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky Thank You
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Yes it is quite clear  thank you
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Lovely Professional University for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Glagotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Nop I'm not
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotia's by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotia's without risking losing out on the scholarship
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Oky that's great I now understand
15/11/23, 8:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood well, have a great night ahead and we shall connect on the 18th of November.
15/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 619 9320: Thank you @917292063289  for enlighting me 

Have a great night too
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, thank you.
18/11/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Please accept my apologies for not being able to reach out sooner; I was not feeling my best today due to some health issues. Thankfully, after taking some medication, I'm feeling much improved. I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.

Can't wait to connect with you on Monday

20/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 619 9320: Good morning @917292063289  i hope you are in good spirits
20/11/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Denzel!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess we did
20/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 619 9320: We really had a good time discussing about  the offer letter and we  really liked the features of the University
20/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 619 9320: I would like you to elaborate on the $750 admission fee and the $300
20/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that let me you explain the $300 is the admission processing fee, which is a standard fee for every international student however since you have enrolled through Edoofa and our admissions team shared your application to the university the $300 admission processing fee has been waived off for you.
20/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The $750 is the registration fee which your counselor must have discussed during the counseling sessions. This $750 is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
20/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Oky so how about the $150 under 

Endowment
20/11/23, 3:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are offered the grant I used the same figures to help you understand better. May I know if you are clear now?
20/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 636 6773: Yess I'm clear
20/11/23, 3:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
20/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 619 9320: No
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively.

As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
