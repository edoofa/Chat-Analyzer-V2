09/09/23, 9:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Patience,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Patience's higher education?

It's good to be back on this platform. 

Kindly update us on  the latest status concerning patience Habwiinga 's admission to a University.
04/12/23, 8:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well, it has been a long time since we connected, and before we start may I know how are you and your family doing today?
04/12/23, 8:22 pm - +260 97 4960102: We are doing alright thank you for asking.
How are you
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to hear that you are doing well. I would like to understand how you left the group since we have been wanting to connect with you here since september?
04/12/23, 8:39 pm - +260 96 7808874: My Airtel line which was on WhatsApp was hacked, while patience,s phone was stolen after a break in the house where it was kept while she was in school.
04/12/23, 8:40 pm - +260 96 7808874: You must have noticed strange messages at the time my WhatsApp was hacked.
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand that completely and I am happy to connect with you again today. Let us start with our discussion from tomorrow, before that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. Grade 12 Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (Grade 12).*

*2. Grade 10 Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)* <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For the letter of recommendation, we have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process. Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

*Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

*Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

*Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

*Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.

This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. I hope you are clear with this?
05/12/23, 10:12 am - +260 96 7808874: Good morning Kirti

Kindly note that patience just completed her grade 12 exams whose results will only be out in January or February 2024. 

For number 2 and 3 I think I did send her grade 9 results into grade 10 and latest results in term one of grade 12 2023 in our last contact before we postponed to resume in September. For  identity proof I did send her under five card as she is still under age to obtain the national ID until after 11.02.2024 when she will reach the required age to obtain it.

The letter of recommendation we have asked her school administration to send it to us. We will be able to share  here as soon as we receive it and also resend her grade 9 results and Under five card for identity proof.

Thank you. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. Yes please I am aware of the fact that she just finished her grade 12 exams, and hence we kept an option for the Letter of recommendation and that is alright please you can share the letter of recommendation as soon as the school shares it with you, however, please note that the format of the letter should be the same as I shared above yesterday.
05/12/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As for the ID, I understand, in that case, you as a parent can also share your ID.
05/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 96 7808874: Good afternoon thank you. We are doing well hope you are. We have taken note and will surely do share as soon as they share with us.
05/12/23, 2:33 pm - +260 96 7808874: Alright I will do share mine as well.
05/12/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. Yes, please in the meantime let us move ahead with our discussion, so may I know if you are ready to start?
05/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 96 7808874: Yes we are.
05/12/23, 2:35 pm - +260 96 7808874: Patience will pick it up I will be following the discussion.

I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course she have selected for her higher education is BCom and it's my understanding that she is planning to arrive in India in August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?

05/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:49 pm - +260 96 7808874: I do remember myself but patience needs to understand herself fully may be you can briefly take her through the stages.
05/12/23, 3:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is completely alright, I'll be more than happy to help Patience explain the steps briefly. The first step was the message from the founders where they shared the message and emphasized the importance of qualities like open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions in the vision of Edoofa, which is to help Edoofians succeed in their careers and become independent and responsible individuals and how we have carefully selected schools and universities based on specific criteria and also highlighted how we prioritize our students and focus on finding qualified educational institutions rather than profit-driven ones. Additionally, the Statement of Purpose (SOP) was explained as a document for students to express their skills, strengths, achievements, vision, and reasons for seeking admission.
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - +260 97 4960102: Noted thank you.
05/12/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, may I know if you have any questions so far?

It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/12/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch.

05/12/23, 6:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/12/23, 6:44 pm - +260 97 4960102: That is very wonderful to hear.
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/12/23, 6:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/12/23, 6:54 pm - +260 97 4960102: I have reviewed the benefits.
05/12/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/12/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, grade 10 and grade 12 results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
05/12/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Patience, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/12/23, 7:03 pm - +260 97 4960102: Wow this is very inspiring and very well understood thank you.
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/12/23, 7:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 7:09 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes it does
05/12/23, 7:10 pm - +260 97 4960102: This is very wonderful as it is helping financely
05/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
05/12/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 7:17 pm - +260 97 4960102: Noted thank you
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 25, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 25 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/12/23, 7:20 pm - +260 97 4960102: I am following
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I have
05/12/23, 7:55 pm - +260 97 4960102: May please provide with more information
05/12/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level/ garde 12 results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two CP grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their Grade 12.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/12/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
05/12/23, 8:05 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I have understood now
05/12/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 CP grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 cp Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/12/23, 8:12 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes
05/12/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ grade 12 (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/12/23, 8:15 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes that's right
05/12/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level/ Grdae 12

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level/ garde 12 exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/12/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/12/23, 8:18 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I am
05/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level/ grade 12 results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/12/23, 8:55 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I am clear
05/12/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/12/23, 9:09 pm - +260 97 4960102: Noted.
05/12/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/12/23, 9:21 pm - +260 97 4960102: No I do not
05/12/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian,  I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/12/23, 9:25 pm - +260 97 4960102: Yes I am
05/12/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/12/23, 9:29 pm - +260 97 4960102: Thank you very much. I will pass your regards to the family.
And thank you for your time
05/12/23, 9:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. It was a pleasure connecting with you.
