31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Anna!
I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?
31/08/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 699 3822: You may proceed
How are you Mr Milan
31/08/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Medical Laboratory Technology.
31/08/23, 10:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
31/08/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Sounds great in all aspects
Will that University open this year
31/08/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. The name of the University is MVN University, and they are situated in the National Capital Region here in India.

31/08/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Very wonderful

04/09/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 699 3824: Annah Magoge previously registered with PDM at a certain amount,
Is this amount of non effect when she now joins MVN
04/09/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 699 3824: MVN starting date is said to be 1 August which is already past.,how will she cope up
04/09/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right. Now, stay assured that we will discuss this moving ahead during our conversation futher. Now, for that to happen, can you please let me know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now?
04/09/23, 3:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding this query of yours, I would like to mention that the dates that are mentioned on the offer letter are tentative dates for the start of this year's intake, which means that the intake would not start exactly at that time. 

On the same note, I would like to mention that MVN University has already released their date of travel and that is in the month of September, specifically within the second-third week.
04/09/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Yes we have gone through the offer letter and understood it
05/09/23, 10:19 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anna!
I hope you are doing well today.
05/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
05/09/23, 10:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
05/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 681 6770: Annual  fee.   1600.
Accommodation 0
Annum tuition 350
Sport and Misc 250
Admission and processing 1000
05/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 681 6770: Morning
05/09/23, 10:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
05/09/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 681 6770: It is
05/09/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
05/09/23, 12:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
05/09/23, 1:07 pm - +263 78 681 6770: Yes it is clear
05/09/23, 1:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
05/09/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 681 6770: Yes I'm
05/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 681 6770: What about number , 2 
I didn't understand
05/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 681 6770: Maintenance feee
05/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Thank you for the updates  Mr Milan

I hope you are finding answers to my questions
I was fully paid with PDM University for the admission of Anna Magoge before embracing the new offer by MVN University.

Is there refund from PDM or any kind of set off?
06/09/23, 6:25 am - +263 78 681 6770: Morning
06/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 699 3822: An earlier response from you would enable us to make an informed decision and budgetary measures
07/09/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 699 3822: Good morning Mr Milan
07/09/23, 10:33 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anna!
I hope you are doing well today.
07/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I was occupied in coordinating the arrival of the newest batch of students here in India. I appreciate your patience here.
07/09/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, shall we move ahead with the discussion that we were having regarding your offer letter from MVN?
07/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 699 3824: Yes
07/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, let me help you with the queries that you have with the offer letter.
07/09/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Number 2 mentioned Living costs, i.e. Accommodation costs, please. And when it comes to the Maintenance Fee it is included in your total per annum costs and caters to the maintenance of the accommodation facility.
07/09/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to the registration fee that you had paid for PDM, then it will be adjusted towards your admission fee at MVN and you would just have to pay the balance fee please.
07/09/23, 12:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you are clear with both of these queries so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/09/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 681 6770: When
07/09/23, 3:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600  and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
07/09/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Thank you sir for the clarification
As soon as PDM and MVN universities are done with the adjustments,may you please inform me of the balance to pay before the elapse of 15 days
08/09/23, 8:04 am - +263 78 681 6770: Morning
09/09/23, 10:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anna!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/09/23, 10:44 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please let me help you with that. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
09/09/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Thank you sir for being helpful
I will make the payment on Monday 11  September 2023

What about admission fee ,is there a top up or it is covered by the previously paid one ?
09/09/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Sorry administration fee*
11/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 699 3822: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 699 3822: Total paid 290
11/09/23, 1:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee. It has been duly noted with us and we have shared it with the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed by the accounts team and the amount has been reflected in India, we will notify you and the university officials accordingly.

I hope this message finds you in good health, and I trust you had a blessed weekend. I see that you've completed your visa application, which is a significant step forward. I would like to inquire when you anticipate receiving your visa from the embassy.

Additionally, let me address the questions you raised over the weekend:
25/09/23, 2:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 1. *Ticket Booking*: You can begin the process of applying for your flight ticket from your home country to India once you have obtained your student visa. 

To do this, you can visit a reputable travel agency or use an online platform to book your flight. It's essential to coordinate your flight's arrival date with the start of your academic program. In your case, the next available arrival dates are on the 4th of October and the 10th of October. Therefore, you should book your flight tickets accordingly for either of these arrival dates.

If you're not already connected with a travel agent, I can provide you with the contact information for a reputable agency. During the founders' visit to Africa last year, they had the opportunity to meet with the founder of this agency, who offers fair prices to students. You can contact them to see if they can assist you in booking your flight.
25/09/23, 2:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. *Bank Statement*: The minimum amount required for your bank statement should demonstrate that you have sufficient funds to cover your tuition fees and living expenses for the first year of your stay in India. 

The specific amount is mentioned in your admission letter, which states it as $600. When you visit the embassy, the officials there will also provide you with further guidance and clarity on this matter.

If you have any more questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you throughout your journey.
25/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 681 6770: What if I have 542
25/09/23, 2:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If you have $542 in your bank account, that should meet the minimum financial requirement for your visa application since the difference is minor. 

This amount should demonstrate that you have sufficient funds to cover your tuition fees and living expenses for the first year of your stay in India, as required by the visa application process. 

You can use this amount as proof of financial means during your visa application.
25/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 681 6770: Give me
25/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 681 6770: Ok thanks

28/09/23, 8:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your ticket. As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 4th of October at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 8:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
28/09/23, 8:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian SIM card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2. Once you check out, do not leave the airport, you have to navigate your way to KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference. This is the pickup point where the team will receive you and help you to your way to the university. 

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Tanaka 2K21JUL0238*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the cab. The cab will take approximately two hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
28/09/23, 8:51 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.
