04/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 554 5340: On the "University Fee Structure" section on this offer letter, point F says "Hostel Fees(Accommodation Only)". I would like to further understand that point.
04/08/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. Thank you for being patient with us. May I know if you are available for a session, dear?
04/08/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Evening to you too, yes I'm available for a session.
04/08/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you were able to go through the above offer letters?
04/08/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: And certainly, the above query will be cleared as we proceed with the discussion.
04/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes I have gone through both of them
04/08/23, 8:46 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Okay
04/08/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Shall we proceed with the offer letter form LPU first?
04/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes, we may.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3825.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $975*2 = $1950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with the off-campus accommodation = $3150.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you prefer more affordable accommodation and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
04/08/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure your scholarship seat with Lovely Professional University, a registration fee of $700 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar, $750 of that amount will be adjusted against the registration fee and the remaining tuition fee for the first year. If you choose to change your university, you can transfer your admission without any additional payment. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
04/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes I'm clear with this
04/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, let me share a few insights into the university with you as well: 

LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
04/08/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

04/08/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 554 5340: I will take a look at it tomorrow morning when my network is more stable
04/08/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, in the mean time shall we now move on to the Offer letter from MVN?
04/08/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes, we may.
04/08/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
04/08/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship? 
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
04/08/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 554 5340: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
04/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes indeed it is quite a fantastic opportunity. <This message was edited>
04/08/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes. Indeed. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
04/08/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
04/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 71 554 5340: The part of this offer letter stating "Hostel Fee( Accommodation Only)" raises concerns.
04/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes, I have understood that part.
04/08/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, let me help you with that. Now, regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please.
04/08/23, 9:42 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Thank you for clearing that, I understand better now.
04/08/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
04/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Please pardon me for slowing you down but I'm just curious as to what is meant by EDB and Book Bank
04/08/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: EDB stands for "Educational Development Bank." It is an institution or a financial organization that provides loans, financial aid, or grants specifically for educational purposes. Educational Development Banks aim to support students, educational institutions, and educational projects by offering favorable loan terms or financial assistance for various educational needs, such as tuition fees, study materials, research projects, and infrastructure development.
04/08/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Book Bank: A Book Bank is a library-like facility or service provided by educational institutions to support their students' academic needs. The Book Bank typically contains a collection of textbooks and reference materials that students can borrow for a specific period. It is intended to assist students who may not be able to afford all the required textbooks or study materials. By borrowing books from the Book Bank, students can have access to essential reading materials without the financial burden of purchasing them outright.
04/08/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleas let me know when you are clear, dear.
04/08/23, 9:49 pm - +263 71 554 5340: I clearly understand now, we may proceed.
04/08/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
04/08/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
04/08/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes I am.
04/08/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600 and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
04/08/23, 9:56 pm - +263 71 554 5340: This is a very beneficial method.
04/08/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850- $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
04/08/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes I'm clear. Also, I'm supposed to top up the registration fee with another $250, right?
04/08/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you opt for the said university you will be required to do that, dear.
04/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Okay I understand
04/08/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to secure your scholarship seat with MVN University, a fee of $1000 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Gulzar Group of Institutions, the total of $750 that you paid for your fee at Gulzar Group of Institutions will be adjusted against the registration fee at MVN University and hence you would have to pay the difference in fee which becomes $1000 - $750 = $250.

If you decide to change your university and transfer your admission to MVN University, you will have to make a payment of $250 before the 10th of August. I hope this clarifies the information for you? <This message was edited>
04/08/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 554 5340: Yes it does.

Allow me to clarify that during the time you tried to reach me, I was unavailable as it was the weekend. As for adding your mother's number to the group, I have taken the initiative to share the invite link with her, as her WhatsApp settings prevented her from being added directly.
07/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 554 5340: I'm well, how are you?

07/08/23, 9:15 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be required to pay on or before the 10th of August, dear.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 01:05 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
04/09/23, 6:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499

04/09/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Since you are arriving late in the night, once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am and hence you would have to stay inside the airport for your safety in the morning at 10:00, you will have to check out. In the morning, you can meet the Edoofa officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Clayton 2K22JUN2175*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
04/09/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport.
