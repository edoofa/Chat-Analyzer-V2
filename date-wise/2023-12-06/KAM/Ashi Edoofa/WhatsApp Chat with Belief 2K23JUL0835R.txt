1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 03:00 pm. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Belief 2K23JUL0835R*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $30 to $40 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
04/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 339 0258: We really appreciate the effort you put in to ensure that our journey to India goes smooth. It is well understood that we have keep started documents with us for easy Identification.

I hope this message finds you well, despite the unexpected challenges you've encountered on your journey to Delhi. We understand that missing your flight from Bombay to Delhi has caused significant inconvenience, and we are here to provide the necessary assistance to ensure your safe and timely arrival at your destination.
06/09/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: First and foremost, we want to emphasize that boarding a train as an alternative is not advisable. Train journeys in a new country can be arduous, time-consuming, and pose certain risks. It may take more than 24 hours to reach Delhi, which can be exhausting and may not guarantee your safety. Therefore, we strongly urge you to communicate with your travel agent and impress upon them that your safety and timely arrival are our utmost priorities. Under no circumstances should you consider taking a train.
06/09/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Instead, we recommend booking the next available flight to Delhi. If you encounter any difficulties or resistance from your travel agent, kindly discuss your concerns with them and involve your parents if necessary. Ideally, the expenses for this flight should be covered by your agent since they are responsible for the initial booking mishap.
06/09/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: While we understand that luggage expenses are a concern, please firmly convey to your agent that they should bear these costs due to the booking error.

Should you decide to take the SpiceJet flight departing at 09:00 PM, even though it's a holiday in India, please rest assured that our team will be available at the airport to receive you in the morning. However, if you opt for the train journey, it may not be possible for us to provide the same level of assistance, and you may encounter additional challenges.
06/09/23, 10:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Your safety and well-being are our top priorities, and we are fully committed to supporting you during this journey. Please maintain open communication with your agent, discuss your concerns with your family, and prioritize booking a flight to Delhi. 

Regardless of the circumstances or arrangements made by your travel agent, please stay in touch with us and provide regular updates on your arrival details. This will enable us to be well-prepared to assist you upon your arrival in India.

We understand the stress and inconvenience this situation has caused you, and we are here to ensure a smooth and safe continuation of your journey to Delhi. If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
06/09/23, 4:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Belief

10/09/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Belief

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotia University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester.
10/09/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Belief Kasolo
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding first-semester balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee is should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India.

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
10/09/23, 11:03 am - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rithvik, the head of student welfare, will be available at the university to address any inquiries students may have. He will also provide information about the remaining fee balance and guide students through the process of fee deposits. I am sharing Mr. Rithvik number, the Head of the Division of Student Welfare,  - +91 7696398732 and Mr. Mukund number, an Associate in the same department - +91 93546 23922

Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $250 fee. 

If you have already brought your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes.

22/09/23, 1:00 pm - +91 96674 96269: Qn 1. It has been going well interacting and socializing with new friends. People of different cultures. Though we haven't fully explored the whole compus ,but it has been quite adventure .
No I didn't know about floating post office. If then , it  actually shows how  creative the  engineers are .

Q2 . Well am still connected with my mentor *Ms Sharda* and each passing day is full of learning and experiencing each other. Of course am not aware of the credits I have made already. 

I heard about the student who bought a leptop for himself. It actually motivates me and I wish to do the same also 🤦‍♂️. 

Qn 3. We actually struggled in the first days but as for now we are really adapting to chilli's and spiced food.  The good part is, in  most of  supermarkets  you can find African based food where  one can buy and cook for himself. 

Thank you.
