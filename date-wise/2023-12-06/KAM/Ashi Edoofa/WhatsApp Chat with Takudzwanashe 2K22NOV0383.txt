06/09/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Takudzwanashe,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024.

20/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Very correct thank you

20/09/23, 3:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That would be all for now, thank you for asking.

21/09/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 369 2663: We are very fine thank you how are you
21/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Managed to send the statement of entry
21/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the documents they are well received by the admission team.
21/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Yes sir l'm ready
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir for the reminder
21/09/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
21/09/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir for the clarification we're on the same page
21/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Can't wait for the offer letter
21/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
21/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
21/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
21/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir it's quite encouraging
21/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 369 2663: I'm more than ready Sir
21/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
21/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
21/09/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
21/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 369 2663: I have reviewed we can continue
21/09/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
21/09/23, 4:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
21/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Well understood thank you
21/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
21/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
21/09/23, 4:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 369 2663: In other words you are saying the fees will not be increased for the whole academic year if l get you right
21/09/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
21/09/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
21/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Well understood sir thanks a lot
21/09/23, 5:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
21/09/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
21/09/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
21/09/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Well explained sir we can continue
21/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/09/23, 5:13 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Kindly provide information for us Sir
21/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
21/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
21/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
21/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Wooow this is too good very true indeed it's an advantage to be an Edoofian
21/09/23, 5:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
21/09/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Very true indeed sir
21/09/23, 5:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
21/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Very true indeed sir
21/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Quiet amazing
21/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
21/09/23, 5:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
21/09/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Which is very good
21/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
21/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Very clear sir you can go ahead
21/09/23, 5:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/09/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 369 2663: We don't wish for that sir anywhere it's a good option if something beyond our control comes along
21/09/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure that this will not happen to you, dear. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Everything is crystal clear as of now we can continue
21/09/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Takudzwanashe's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Takudzwanashe is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
21/09/23, 6:07 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Can't wait for that sir l'm more than willing
21/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Takudzwanashe's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
21/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir we really appreciate
21/09/23, 6:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
21/09/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir we receive with thanks will be waiting to hear from you .... once again we're so thankful
21/09/23, 6:41 pm - +27 74 830 9235: Thank you very much Sir
26/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwanashe!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all!

26/09/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 1:32 pm - +27 74 830 9235: Good afternoon Sir
We are very thrilled about this milestone , and we are really thankful, and totally appreciate all the, effort s the team put
We gonna go through it, thank you very much
26/09/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Wooooow lovely thank you so much sir we are so happy no words can explain how thankful we're
26/09/23, 3:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome! We will now connect with each other tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss about the letter. Until then, have a good day!
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir likewise
27/09/23, 12:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Takudzwanashe!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
27/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Good morning sir we're very fine
27/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Yes we managed to go through it we need so clarification on some areas
27/09/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 369 2663: How do we pay that deposit fee considering the bank is not in our country
27/09/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Stay assured that we will discuss all the queries that you have moving ahead during our conversation. Now, I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Galgotias University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-

1. What’s your ser semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
27/09/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 369 2663: 1.$900
2.3 years (6 semesters)
3.$300
4.$750
27/09/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a three-year-long course. Each academic year is divided into 2 semesters, and hence you will have 6 semesters in your degree. 

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $900 which makes your per annum tuition fee ($900*2) = $1800. I hope you are clear about this.
27/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Well understood sir thank you
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
27/09/23, 1:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
27/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Well understood sir but I think for convenience purposes it's better for our son to use On campus accomodation... considering he will be new so cooking and trying to buy some stuffs to prepare it might be stressful to him
27/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 369 2663: In as much as off campus accomodation is cheaper it might be stressful to him
27/09/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand what you are trying to say here, however, from our experience students never experience such challenges becuase at a specific time, when multiple students live with each other, they manage all the things effortlessly. Moreover, wherever there may be a challenge, we are always ready to step in and help them in that scenario. 

Hence, choosing whichever accommodation that you wish won't give Takudzwanashe any challenge. I hope this is clear?
27/09/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much for the clarification sir is it possible to start with on campus accomodation then switch to off campus
27/09/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 369 2663: I think we'll discuss again as a family a decide which is the best for him
27/09/23, 1:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, it is completely possible, the final choice will remain with you. And you can take your time to discuss on that since Takudzwanashe will be coming to India next year please. Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
27/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 369 2663: That's great news indeed
27/09/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 369 2663: So in that case he can use off campus accomodation
27/09/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right! Now, As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester makings it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
27/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Well understood sir thanks a lot
27/09/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now as you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300 has been waived under the Early Registration Scheme which means it is not added to your cost of education.

When we talk about the registration fee, it is $750 for Galgotias University, and for a student to reserve their scholarship seat with the university, they are supposed to pay $750 towards the same. I hope this is clear as well?
27/09/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Well understood sir
27/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
27/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 10th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 10th November 2023.*
27/09/23, 2:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *10th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
27/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much l think we are going to pay $300 by the 10th of October and the other $300 before the 10th of November
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
27/09/23, 2:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
27/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir we're are in Kwekwe Midlands province
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 369 2663: We are not in Harare
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
27/09/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
27/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir will organize someone to go and meet Mr Rajan
27/09/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
27/09/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 369 2663: So it will be 7% of $300
27/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 369 2663: That will be more convenient

27/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Amazing thank you so much sir
27/09/23, 3:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
27/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much sir we really appreciate and we are definitely going to do that
27/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Can't believe it as soon as we pay we are going to send the proof
27/09/23, 3:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you! Have a good day ahead.

28/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 369 2663: The good thing is that we discussed about this program from the beginning so most of the misconceptions were cleared so they said we hope for the best considering it's a completely a new environment but the fact that you guarantee us 100 % support they are in support of it
28/09/23, 2:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I find it reassuring that your parents have been working hard to ensure that your career is on the right path and that they're well-prepared to support you. Following your discussion with your family about the offer letter, do you have any questions or concerns that you would like us to address?
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 369 2663: As of now we have no questions but in the event that we have them we will always come back to you
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you have any questions or require any help, feel free to bring them up and share them with us here. We can discuss them and assist you in planning for your child's education.
28/09/23, 3:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: I hope that you have discussed with your family the registration fee, payment deadlines, and mode of payment and that you have also taken note of these important details since they are crucial in reserving your scholarship seat right?
28/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Yes sir very true indeed
28/09/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 369 2663: We are working towards it

28/09/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. May I know if you are planning to make the payment of your fee in one part of $600 to complete the process early or in two parts of $300 as per the due dates shared by the university so that we can pass the same information to them?
28/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 369 2663: We're going for 2 parts of $300
28/09/23, 3:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand and you can surely do that, and I will inform the university authorities about our conversation today. It seems that you are taking the appropriate steps toward financing your education and should reserve your scholarship seat soon. Additionally, could you please inform me of the date when you intend to pay your fees?
28/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 369 2663: I think we're going to pay tomorrow
28/09/23, 3:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know. I will update the university officials as well. We are done with our sessions for now and since you now have an offer letter with you, the next step for you is to pay your university registration fee as per the deadline shared and reserve the scholarship seat.
						
After making the payment, kindly send us the receipt so that we can confirm it with the accounts team and inform the university officials. Don't hesitate to contact us if you require any assistance.

I wanted to follow up regarding the recent payment made for the remaining balance of $333. As per our records, the payment was initiated to Mr. Shorwi's account. However, there has been a change in Mr. Shorwi's Account Details and therefore, there is a possibility that the payment could have been canceled.

To ensure everything is in order, could you please check with your bank to verify if the payment to Mr. Shorwi's account has been successfully processed? If there are any complications or if the payment hasn't gone through, we kindly request you to do that again on the updated account details of Mr. Shorwi, I am sharing that for you here.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I am Ms. Ashi, the Admission Officer at Edoofa. I am pleased to inform you that the payment of your registration fee has been confirmed by the accounts team and we have updated the university officials on the same.

As per the updates we have from the admissions team, they are hopeful to get updates from Lovely Professional University as well for your application, we are waiting for the same so that you have another scholarship offer and you can make a well-informed decision for your higher education and then the university will process your provisional admission acceptance letter.
23/11/23, 7:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Additionally , Since your admission intake is for August 2024, you will be working on the visa requirements for now and towards the month of April 2024 when the universities release the tentative arrival dates for the upcoming batch. That is when you will be visiting the embassy to submit your documents and process your visa application further. I hope you are clear on this?

Let me help you here -

Once you gave the team a go-ahead to proceed with your university admission process, your application was shared with multiple universities which were applicable to your course and were recommended by the Academic Board. Lovely Professional University is one of those universities and they are currently evaluating your application, and if they decide to offer a scholarship to you, they will send you an offer letter.
24/11/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: After getting another offer letter, if you decide to change your university to LPU, you will be able to do the same without paying any additional amount of money. Are you clear on this?
24/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 369 2663: We once receive a conditional offer letter from Galgotias University which means he's no longer going to Galgotias University or kindly elaborate on that one
24/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Is Galgotias University part of Lovely Professional University
24/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you in understanding @263773692663, First of all, I would like to clarify that Galgotias University and Lovely Professional University are distinct universities in India, each with its own merits and offerings. With this, as you have successfully completed your registration at Galgotias University, it's important to note that your scholarship seat has been securely reserved with the university. Moreover, your application is also currently under consideration at Lovely Professional University, and we are optimistic about a positive outcome.
24/11/23, 1:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: On this note, If you receive an offer letter from Lovely Professional University, you will be presented with a valuable opportunity to choose the university that best aligns with your educational goals. There is no need to worry about any additional financial burden, as you can seamlessly switch to Lovely Professional University without incurring any extra costs. However, if you feel comfortable with your current choice which is Galgotias University you can stay with the same. I hope you understand?
24/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Thank you so much for the clarification ma'am l do understand
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263773692663
24/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 369 2663: Blessed day 🙏
