I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotia University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester.
10/09/23, 11:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Zolani Clarence Mpofu
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 11:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding first-semester balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee is should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India.

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
10/09/23, 11:07 am - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rithvik, the head of student welfare, will be available at the university to address any inquiries students may have. He will also provide information about the remaining fee balance and guide students through the process of fee deposits. I am sharing Mr. Rithvik number, the Head of the Division of Student Welfare,  - +91 7696398732 and Mr. Mukund number, an Associate in the same department - +91 93546 23922

Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $250 fee. 

If you have already brought your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes.
