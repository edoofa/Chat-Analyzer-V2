31/08/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Marvellous,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past two days, we were unavailable due to the celebration of Rakhi, a significant and cherished festival in our culture.

Rakhi holds great importance in our lives, as it's a time when we come together as a family to celebrate the bond between siblings. The festivities and rituals of the day required my full attention and participation, which unfortunately led to my inability to connect with you.
31/08/23, 4:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to inform you that the University has issued your acceptance and bonafide letter. I have attached copies of these letters, as well as the compliance letter from the university, for your reference. 

Please review them carefully as you will need them for your visa application process. Once you have gone through the letters, kindly send us an acknowledgment to this group so that we can guide you with the visa application form.

If you have any questions or require further assistance with the visa application or any other matters, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here to support you throughout this process.

31/08/23, 5:09 pm - +260 97 9023317: Yes so the same documents I have I should photocopy them twice??
31/08/23, 5:45 pm - +260 97 9023317: And for tuition fee 
Do I have to pay while in my foreign country or while there
31/08/23, 8:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @260979023317, you need two photocopies for these. For better clarity and understanding, I would like to continue our session by discussing the compliance letter from the university and attending the query you have regarding your fee. May I know if you have gone through the same and if you are ready to proceed with the session?
31/08/23, 9:12 pm - +260 97 9023317: Yes I was asking about the same
31/08/23, 9:13 pm - +260 97 9023317: Do I have to pay before I travel??
31/08/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, @260979023317, that is correct, I would help you understand the same in our today's discussion. Let us begin to discuss the same compliance letter by understanding what FRRO actually is. 

FRRO stands for Foreigners Regional Registration Office and every Individual regardless of the type of visa they carry in India has to register themselves on the online portal of FRRO within 14 days of arrival mandatorily.
31/08/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Since you are an International Student and are coming to study here in India, as per the norms of the Indian Government once you arrive in India you too will have to register for FRRO. The FRRO is the primary agency to regulate the registration, movement, stay, and departure, and also for recommending the extension of stay in India.
31/08/23, 9:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Most of the International students have to do their FRRO process on their own, however since you are an Edoofian, your complete FRRO process will be taken care of by the university officials and they would guide you with all the procedures. Are you clear about this now?
31/08/23, 9:20 pm - +260 97 9023317: So I’ll have to do the FRRO upon arriving?
31/08/23, 9:21 pm - +260 97 9023317: ☝️
31/08/23, 9:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Marvelous! If you have been following my messages carefully, I have indeed mentioned that you would have to pay your fee. I will be helping you understand the same in detail as we move forward with our decision. However, it seems like you are not patient enough to allow me to share the details with you. How shall we proceed if you wouldn't let me share the details with you? <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 9:29 pm - +260 97 9023317: Sorry ma’am 
Upon reading I thought FRRO is different from tuition fee
31/08/23, 9:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand, if we are on the same page and if you have understood about the FRRO, shall we continue with our disucssion?
31/08/23, 9:33 pm - +260 97 9023317: Sure
31/08/23, 9:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please. Now that you are aware of the role the FRRO plays and how important it is for the students to complete the same in due time, as a student it is important for you to clear your first semester’s fee as per the timeline shared by the university so that your process can be carried out smoothly and you do not face any challenge in India.
31/08/23, 9:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Considering the same, the university has advised and encouraged the students to clear the first-semester fee before their arrival to India. Hence, may I know you are aware of your fee break up for your first semester?
31/08/23, 9:39 pm - +260 97 9023317: Yes am fully aware
31/08/23, 9:41 pm - +260 97 9023317: Alright
31/08/23, 9:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me also help you with the breakup of your fee to ensure we are on the same page. As per your offer letter, your per-semester fee breakup is as follows:

1. Tuition Fee Per Semester - $900
2. Examination Fee Per Semester - $100

Now, when you add up both of these components, your per-semester cost of education that is due to the university becomes $900 + $100 = $1000.
31/08/23, 9:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Since you have already paid the registration fee of $750 through Edoofa to reserve your scholarship seat, the same amount has been adjusted toward your first semester's cost of education. This leaves a remaining balance of $1000 - $750 = $250. 

It is important to note that this fee of $250 needs to be cleared on or before your arrival at the university, specifically before September 6th, 2023. This will ensure a smooth transition and allow you to fully engage in your academic journey. Can you please confirm if this information is clear to you?
31/08/23, 9:45 pm - +260 97 9023317: So as of now I have to pay the remaining $250 to complete the fee?
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is correct @260979023317. When we talk about the payment modes, the payment can be made through the same modes you have used before, the international transfer charges would be 10% of the amount you want to send making the total amount to be deposited as $275. I hope you are clear with this and this attends to the query you had on your mind?
31/08/23, 9:59 pm - +260 97 9023317: Yes am clear ma’am
31/08/23, 10:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Great @260979023317. I hope you have the account details for the payment for your fee? It is the same one you used before and hence I believe you must have them with you.
31/08/23, 10:09 pm - +260 97 9023317: If you don’t mind 
May I have the details again?
31/08/23, 10:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 10:17 pm - +260 97 9023317: Alright
31/08/23, 10:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have everything in order, I want you to fill in your visa application form and after you have completed the form, kindly click on the "Submit" button and download the online form. 

Once you have downloaded it, please share the form with me here, so I can crosscheck all the details and ensure everything is accurate. This will help us move forward with the next steps in the process smoothly. 

If you encounter any issues or have any questions during the form submission, feel free to reach out, and I'll be here to assist you. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to receiving the downloaded form.

I hope you are doing well, With respect to our last discussion, you will collect your Visa today. Kindly make sure to share your Visa with us,  We would like to update the same in our records and notify the university officials so that they can make the necessary arrangements accordingly.
08/09/23, 8:56 am - +260 97 9023317: Greetings ma’am
08/09/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 9023317: I’ll do that when I collect it
08/09/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 9023317: Besides can I finish the remaining fees now
08/09/23, 8:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @260979023317 , We'll be waiting for your response.
08/09/23, 8:59 am - +260 97 9023317: Okay
08/09/23, 9:00 am - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing I am glad to know that you are ready with your remaining fees, May I know if you are aware of the remaining amount so that I confirm we are on the same page.
08/09/23, 9:02 am - +260 97 9023317: $250?
08/09/23, 9:04 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with the breakup of your fee to ensure we are on the same page. As per your offer letter, your per-semester fee breakup is as follows:


1. Tuition Fee Per Annum - $1800
2. Examination Fee Per Annum - $200
08/09/23, 9:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now, when you add up both of these components, your per-annum cost of education that is due to the university becomes $1800 + $200 = $2000.

Since you have already paid the registration fee of $750 through Edoofa to reserve your scholarship seat, the same amount has been adjusted toward your first year's fee due to the university. This leaves a remaining balance of $2000 - $750 = $1250.
08/09/23, 9:06 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding first-year balance fee of $1250, we'd like to remind you that this fee is divided into two installments of $625 each. The initial installment should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India, and the second installment is due in the subsequent semester.

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
08/09/23, 9:08 am - +260 97 9023317: Yes am fully aware of this 
Last time we talked about the FRRO then you said I can pay the remaining balance of the first semester so that my name can be registered there then for the second semester I’ll pay later on
08/09/23, 9:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @260979023317 I am glad that you remember the discussion regarding the remaining fees. Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $625 fee. 

If you have already brought your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes.
08/09/23, 10:31 am - +260 97 9023317: So how much should I pay to complete my first semester?
08/09/23, 10:32 am - +260 97 9023317: Yes, that is correct @260979023317. When we talk about the payment modes, the payment can be made through the same modes you have used before, the international transfer charges would be 10% of the amount you want to send making the total amount to be deposited as $275. I hope you are clear with this and this attends to the query you had on your mind?
08/09/23, 10:32 am - +260 97 9023317: I thought I’ll be paying that amount then the rest I’ll finish later on
08/09/23, 10:35 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me confirm the amount from the team, will update you soon
08/09/23, 10:36 am - +260 97 9023317: Alright ma’am

10/09/23, 10:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Marvellous

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotia University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester.
10/09/23, 10:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Marvellous Kangeta
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 10:42 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding semester balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India,

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 01:05 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
11/09/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

11/09/23, 3:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Since you are arriving late in the night, once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am and hence you would have to stay inside the airport for your safety in the morning at 10:00, you will have to check out. In the morning, you can meet the Edoofa officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Marvellous 2K22AUG0965*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
