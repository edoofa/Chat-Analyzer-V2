I hope this message finds you in good health.

I am Mr. Milan, the Senior Admissions Officer at Edoofa. Currently, I am diligently reviewing the application files of students who are preparing to join us for the 2023 intake in India. During this process, I noticed that you have plans to commence your studies at PDM University.
31/08/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: As we eagerly await the arrival date confirmation from PDM University, I wanted to mention that we recently engaged in a conversation to finalize the details, and the university has indicated that they will be providing us with an update within this week.

Given the time at hand, I would like to seize this opportunity to discuss a potential option with you that could potentially enhance both the affordability and enrichment of your higher education experience in India. Would now be a suitable time for us to engage in this discussion or otherwise, you can let me know by when can we have this discussion?
31/08/23, 9:54 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright it's nice to connect with you Mr milan ,so we can discuss now
31/08/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm delighted to learn that you are open to discussing this matter. Before we get into the specifics, I wanted to share a recent development that could significantly influence your educational journey.

Edoofa has recently established a partnership with a new university here in India. This collaboration has prompted the academic board to revisit scholarship opportunities for a select group of students, including yourself, with the intention of providing a more enhanced educational pathway.

Under this new collaboration, the university is offering more substantial scholarship opportunities for the course related to your field of study, particularly in the field of Commerce.
31/08/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Through this unique opportunity, you are in a position to secure a remarkable 90% scholarship on your tuition fee, along with a 100% sponsorship for your accommodation expenses. What's particularly striking is the potential to significantly alleviate the financial burdens tied to education. This could effectively bring down your annual expenses to just $1600, encompassing all essential aspects of your education and residence.

I am eager to hear your initial thoughts on this matter. Would you be interested in exploring this specialized course further and getting into the finer details of how this opportunity could potentially transform your educational journey?
31/08/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 076 0225: So you mean in short  ,this it will give me 90%  scholarship   on Tuition fee  and 100% accomodation sponsorship
31/08/23, 10:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is very right! Moving ahead, after thorough reconsideration of your application as well as a proper analysis of your documents, the academic board has suggested that you should pursue the course B.Com for your higher education here in India for the given opportunity since it would help you in having a better career in the future as well as you would also be able to make your higher education even more affordable. I hope you understand?
31/08/23, 10:08 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes,now i understood sir
31/08/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 076 0225: A point of corrections Mr sir would you say B . Commerce  instead of BA Geography
31/08/23, 10:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Fanwell, that wasn't an error dear, the considering your abilities, your academic records as well as what the future holds for the students like yourself, the academic board has strongly suggester that you should pursue the course B.Com. instead of BA Geography. I hope you understand?
31/08/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright , but is that not limited  course for searching jobs , because sometimes you can go through the course which limited for jobbing
31/08/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand what you are trying to say, however, I want to assure you that the field of Commerce, specifically B.Com, can provide you with a wide range of opportunities and is not as limited as it might seem. A degree in Commerce can open doors to various industries, including finance, accounting, marketing, business administration, and more.

Furthermore, this specialized course we're discussing has been designed to incorporate practical skills, industry-relevant knowledge, and internships that can greatly enhance your employability. It's not just about acquiring a degree; it's about gaining the skills and experiences that employers value in today's competitive job market.
31/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright ,sir i understood   it sounds interesting
31/08/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 076 0225: I like that course sir

Moreover, their intake is about to begin since they have already released the dates for their students and that is in the month of September by the second week. Isn't that wonderful?
31/08/23, 10:36 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Thats wonderful  Sir , I'm glad  to hear that type of good news

Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a 100% scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
04/09/23, 3:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Ooh wow thats amazing I love it
05/09/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Afternoon Sir
07/09/23, 3:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
07/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 076 0225: At sports they include gymnastics ?
07/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, all the sports that the university provides will be informed to you once you will arrive here in India. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
07/09/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
07/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Oooh that's great sir  we are on the same page
07/09/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1250 and so the balance fee becomes $1250 - $1000 = $250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
07/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Wow this is very  affordable
07/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Because the thee remain amount  will be little
07/09/23, 4:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
07/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Yes sir I'm clearly understand
07/09/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, moving ahead, as you can see the admission fee for MVN University is $1000, and since you have already paid $750 for your registration at PDM University, this leaves you with a balance of $250 to be paid in order to shift and confirm your admission at MVN. Can you please help me understand by when do you think you would be able to complete this payment as well so that we can move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey?
07/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright sir let's saying by Monday
07/09/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
07/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 076 0225: My question is  when i pay $1000 for admission this will be deducted from my first year fee ??
07/09/23, 4:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. Once the $1000 admission fee is paid, then it will be deducted from your first year fee, I have explained the same here you can go through it again.
07/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Mean my first year fee is $1500-$1000  =$500 thats my fee when I come to Indian
07/09/23, 4:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right!
07/09/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Alright sir now i understood
07/09/23, 4:51 pm - +263 78 076 0225: Thank you for let me know this
07/09/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you have any other queries that you would like to ask?

22/11/23, 12:16 pm - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of utmost importance regarding your child's academic standing at the college.

Despite several reminders and extensive conversations, it has come to our attention that the outstanding fees of *$500* your child's education have not been settled. We have made diligent efforts to work with you, engaging in negotiations with the university on your behalf. Regrettably, these efforts have not yielded a resolution, and the outstanding payment remains unresolved.

As a result of the persistent non-payment, the college has taken the difficult decision to block your child's access to classes. This means that, effective immediately, your child will be unable to attend any classes until the outstanding fees are settled.

We understand that financial matters can be challenging, and we have been committed to finding an amicable solution. However, the prolonged non-payment has left us with no alternative but to take this measure.

We urge you to address this matter urgently to ensure your child's uninterrupted academic progress. 

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. We believe that together we can resolve this issue and continue to support your child's educational journey.
