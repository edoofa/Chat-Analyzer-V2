And I would like to share that LPU has also accepted your application and shared your Offer Letter. Congratulations to you for that! 🌟🎓

I hope you are doing well today.
17/08/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 296 9662: Morning how are you
17/08/23, 10:31 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine please, thank you for asking. Now, when it comes to the rankings of LPU, I would like to mention that LPU is one of the top universities in India and also holds the #1 place among all the private universities. Hence, when you get LPU, you can stay assured that you are getting the best of what there is to offer.
17/08/23, 10:39 am - +263 77 796 2048: How are you?
17/08/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine please thank you for asking. Now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter from LPU by now?
17/08/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 796 2048: Yes i did go through the offer letter
17/08/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/08/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 796 2048: 1.$1475
2.2years
3.200 usd
4.700 usd
17/08/23, 10:56 am - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 2-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 4 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1475 making your per annum tuition fee ($1475*2) = $2950. Is that clear?
17/08/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 796 2048: Yes it is clear
17/08/23, 11:11 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
17/08/23, 11:11 am - Milan Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1475*2 = $2950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $4825.
17/08/23, 11:12 am - Milan Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1475*2 = $2950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $4150.
17/08/23, 11:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Compared to the on-campus accommodation, if you prefer more affordable housing and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
17/08/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 796 2048: It is well noted
17/08/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 796 2048: I would also prefer living off campus
17/08/23, 11:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, to secure your scholarship seat with Lovely Professional University, a registration fee of $700 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias University, the total of $750 that you paid for your fee at Galgotias University will be adjusted against the registration fee at Lovely Professional University for the first year.

If you decide to change your university and transfer your admission to Lovely Professional University, there will be no additional payment required. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
17/08/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 796 2048: Yes it is very clear and I understand
17/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 296 9662: For now l think  Galgotias University is Ok
17/08/23, 2:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, may I know if you have finalized that you will be going to Galgotias University for your higher education?
17/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 296 9662: We discussed and agreed on Galgotias University because there is an MBA specialising in IT
17/08/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 796 2048: Yes you can finalize that
17/08/23, 3:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, let me pass on the same information to the university officials and get your admission confirmed for Galgotias University.
17/08/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Noted with thanks
17/08/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 796 2048: Okay thank you so much

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotia University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester.
10/09/23, 10:38 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Tolerant Sympathy Makonya
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 10:38 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding semester balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India, 

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly.
10/09/23, 10:39 am - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $250 fee. 

If you want to bring your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes.
10/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 796 2048: The information is correct and i would like to clear the balance when i arrive in India
11/09/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 14:45 pm at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly. <This message was edited>
11/09/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
11/09/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 03:00 pm. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Tolerant 2K23JUN2995*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $30 to $40 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
11/09/23, 12:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.

23/10/23, 8:04 am - Rithvik Edoofa: Dear Tolerant and Parents,
This is Mr. Rithvik here, HOD, Department of Student Welfare.

I want to extend my heartfelt sympathies for the unfortunate incident that Tolerant has faced upon her arrival in India. It deeply saddens us to hear about the robbery resulting in the loss of her visa and passport.

Please know that we are here to support Tolerant. <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 8:08 am - +263 77 296 9662: We appreciate it but it's almost 2 months now and no one is helping her. She is trying on her own but has been moved from police station to another without success due to language barrier. Every police station she goes she is told NO ENGLISH.... She has been to Zimbabwe Embassy in New Delhi, and again they need a police report
23/10/23, 8:08 am - +263 77 296 9662: Otherwise how are you
23/10/23, 8:56 am - Rithvik Edoofa: I understand that
May I know if she has informed Mr. Mukund regarding this?
23/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 296 9662: He is aware of it
23/10/23, 9:27 am - Rithvik Edoofa: Please do not worry
He will be connecting with Tolerant this week and we will get this issue sorted as soon as possible
25/10/23, 8:04 am - +91 93546 23922: Dear Parents,
I'm Mr. Mukund, and I'm deeply concerned about the recent incident involving Tolerant. We've been actively working to assist her in this matter, such as digitally filing an FIR report and even asking Eugene to accompany her to the police station.

I personally reached out to the university faculty to obtain the contact information for the Zimbabwe Embassy so that they could guide Tolerant on the procedure to obtain her new passport. However, there hasn't been any communication from her side since then. I usually spend time at Galgotias three times a week, but due to upcoming festivals and some health issues, my schedule for this week has changed. As a result, I will be returning there tomorrow.
I am more than happy to help her further with the process, apologizes incase of any miscommunication from our side, let us know if there's any support that is needed from our side
25/10/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 296 9662: After failing to get any help from the police stations due language barrier, she went to Zimbabwe Embassy, New Delhi and she was told to go and get a police report so that they can help her. The last time l talked to her she was advised to go to FRO offices. Am yet to get feedback from her. Our may concern is that someone can use the passport or steal something and drop her passport there and she will be suspect especially if its not reported to the police
01/11/23, 12:48 pm - +91 93546 23922: *Reminder: Orientation Tomorrow*

09/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Tolerant can't do some of those requirements because she has no passport and visa. The documents were stolen from an insecured accommodation that one of your girls looked for her. Unfortunately she is failing to get a police report so that we can apply for her passport here because of language barrier and no one even from your office, has helped her
09/11/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 296 9662: The documents were stolen. Currently we are trying to engage Ministry of Foreign Aoffairs  for help because we are so concerned about this situation
09/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 296 9662: Personally l had hoped that Edoofa people should be helpful her but honestly am not seeing their efforts. My son is also supposed to come there next year and l had hoped a fair treatment of  her in this  time of need
