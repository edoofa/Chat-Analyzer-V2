23/10/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders.

23/10/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/10/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/10/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Ma'am I understand the messages
23/10/23, 1:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant @263777020188 Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.

24/10/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 702 0188: 2.The laws of thermodynamics is a set of scientific laws which define a group of physical quantities such as temperature, energy and entropy, that characterise thermodynamic system in thermodynamic equilibrium. 

- The first law states that when energy passes into or out of the system, the system's internal energy changes in accordance with the law of conservation of energy. 

-The second law of thermodynamics states that in a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of the interacting thermodynamic system never decreases . A common corollary of the statement is that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder body to a warmer body 

- The second rule of thermodynamics is the foundation upon which various forms of vehicles, including ships, trucks and aeroplanes operates

- Third law states that a system's entropy approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. With the exceptions of non-crystalline solids, the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero

3. A valve is a device used for controlling the passage of fluid or through a pipe 

- Butterfly valves are a family of quater-turn rotational motion valve that are used in pipelines to shut off flow. It is often said that Butterfly valves can be used to regulate the flow, however it is not recommended as it can damage the valve disk and have a negative effect on sealing properties. 

- They are used in a wide variety of process media and industries especially in water supply, collection and distribution as well as pumping stations, and have a broad range of use cases especially in flow isolation. A couple of their key advantages over other valve families are their simple construction and compactness resulting in the end products being of lighter weight and lower costs .

- Construction of a Butterfly valve is simple , with the rotation of the valve disc controlling the fluid flow. In the closed position, the disc blocks the valve bore while in the in the open position, the disc is oriented perpendicular to the flow direction to allow flow.

4. Heat treatment is a process that alters the physical and chemical properties of a material. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, quenching and tempering. Aluminium and steel are two of the most common materials that undergo heat treatment. Heat treatment can be used to increase the hardness of a material. 

- The aerospace and automotive industries are two major users of heat treatment. In the aerospace industries, heat treatment is used to improve the strength, hardness and fatigue resistance of metal components. 
In the automotive industry heat treatment is used to improve the wear resistance and fatigue strength of metal parts. Heat treatment can also be used to improve the dimensional stability of metal components. 

In addition heat treatment can also be used to change colour of a material. For example aluminium oxide forms a thin, dark oxide layer on the surface of aluminium that can give it a black, grey appearance. Heat treatment can also improve the ductility of a material. By increasing the ductility of aluminium or steel,  heat treatment can improve the toughness of these materials. 

5.A compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing it's volume. An air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor. Gas turbine are powered by Centrifugal compressors, used in jets, aircraft and other heavy industries applications. In a gas turbine Centrifugal compressors transfer energy from impeller blades. 
Centrifugal compressors are more stable than axial flow ones but of much low capacity and not as efficient

Axial flow compressors are used in all larger gas turbine unit because of their high efficiency  and capacity and it is an alternative of a Centrifugal compressor due to heavyweight and cross-sectional area

The compressor in a gas turbine draws air into the engine, pressurises it and feeds it to the combustion chamber at a speed of hundred miles per hour. The combustion system typically made up of a ring of fuel injectors that inject a steady stream of fuel into the combustion chamber where it mixes with air

25/10/23, 9:59 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Leeroy, I hope you are doing well. 

In reference to our last discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
25/10/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Good Afternoon Ms Ashi
25/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes I'm ready for the discussion
25/10/23, 12:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263777020188 . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.
25/10/23, 12:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (27-Oct-2023).
25/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/BUYJrYkjRaaKU73Aer6T3R
25/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Leeroy Rufaro Charlie, and my EWYL group name is Leeroy EWYL23E0813. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (27-Oct-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
25/10/23, 12:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
25/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 702 0188: OK ma'am
25/10/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Diploma (Mechanical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes it's correct
25/10/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 12:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Right
25/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 702 0188: I understand
25/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes He we did discuss about it
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am I'm following
25/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 702 0188: OK so food is also covered on that fee
25/10/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
25/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Ms Ashi
25/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 702 0188: I understand
25/10/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/10/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/10/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Okay
25/10/23, 1:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 702 0188: No madam it's all clear to me
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
25/10/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have taken a note of the above messages.
25/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 702 0188: They all look happy ❤️
25/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 702 0188: I'm done
25/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263777020188 . The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

25/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 702 0188: I agree
25/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Thank you Ms Ashi I have understood everything no question for now
25/10/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777020188, Have a great day ahead!

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 12:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am I went through with it
15/11/23, 12:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Ms Ashi
15/11/23, 12:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 702 0188: 1. After scholarship tuition fee is $900 per semester 

2. My course is for 3years which are 6 semesters 

3. $300 is the admission and procedure fee

4. Registration fee $ 750
15/11/23, 12:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 12:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University.
15/11/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 702 0188: I understand ma'am
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 702 0188: So at the university there is only 3 and 2 seater and you can not have your own room
15/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. Yes correct dear, However if you want to have a separate room then you can opt for off campus accommodation.
15/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 702 0188: I'm clear with it
15/11/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Ms Ashi I'm following
15/11/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:05 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes please
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Harare but my father will do the payments from South Africa
15/11/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263777020188. If you are planning to make the payment from South Africa, in that case, the most feasible mode still stands to be Mama Money since the Transfer Charges would vary on the particular date, it should be around 3%.
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777020188 May I know if you are facing any challenge as we are waiting for your response?
15/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 702 0188: It's ok ma'am Mama money will be ok I'll inform my father about it
15/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 702 0188: No Ms Ashi my phone's battery was low
15/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Ok ma'am I'm clear on that
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 5:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes I understand very well
15/11/23, 5:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 5:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 5:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Ms Ashi🙂
15/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 6:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 702 0188: No queries ma'am you can share the insights
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition). 

Here, you'll find information about the accreditations and approvals granted by the Government of India, which reflect the university's commitment to meeting national educational standards.
15/11/23, 7:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Understanding that visiting the campus in person may not be feasible at the moment, Galgotias University offers a virtual tour of its facilities. This virtual tour provides you with a unique opportunity to explore the campus online and gain insights into the university's infrastructure and amenities. 

You can access the virtual tour through this link: [Galgotias University Virtual Campus Tour](https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour).

15/11/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777020188 , before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on 18th of November. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
15/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes Ms Ashi that works for me
15/11/23, 7:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Wish you a blessed week ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well!
18/11/23, 7:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Leeroy!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Good afternoon Ms Ashi
20/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 702 0188: I apologise for my absence there was no electricity for 3 days this side
20/11/23, 12:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Leeroy, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

Thank you for letting us know about your situation that you were facing challenges related to electricity which makes you unable to join our session and we truly understand that. On this note, May I know if you are available now for the session please?
20/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am ..although I just called my parents for them to be active during this session and they're said they will be free at 2
20/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 702 0188: So if it's fine we could wait for them or we could just continue without them right now
20/11/23, 12:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that your parents will be able to join us at 2pm today, however I hope we can continue our session for now and then you can connect with your parents and they can go through our conversation. If they have any concern, we will for sure assist them. I hope you understand? <This message was edited>
20/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am...I understand
20/11/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that, May I please know if you've had a family discussion about the offer letter?
20/11/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am and they seem to be OK with the fees
20/11/23, 12:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's great to hear @263777020188 . If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Ma'am,  my father wanted to know if its possible to start paying the fees little by little before I come to India
20/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes I googled about it
20/11/23, 12:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure @263777020188, In order to assist you better, May I please know which fees have you mentioned here?
20/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Tuition fee ma'am
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 702 0188: This message was deleted
20/11/23, 2:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely, your parents concerns are valid. After you clear your registration fee, it is indeed possible for your parents to start paying the university fee gradually in advance, managing it on a monthly basis. 

This flexibility allows you to plan and ease the financial responsibility over time. Financial planning is crucial when you are making a decision to pursue your education abroad, and hence we resonate with the thoughts you have. 

Hence, you can convey to your parents that we understand these considerations, and the payment schedule can be arranged accordingly. I hope this addresses the query you have?
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes thank you ma'am
20/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777020188, as you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
20/11/23, 3:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2 contacts.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Another thing ma'am... I understand that the intake is for  October  but I wanted to know if its possible for me to come to India after I write my Diesel Plant fitting exams here I'm writing November
20/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 702 0188: OK thank you
20/11/23, 7:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777020188 Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you at the earliest as I was occupied with an urgent meeting. However, regarding your concern dear, let me clarify that your academic intake is August 2024 and in order to assist you May I please know when is your exams scheduled for Diesel Plant fitting?

21/11/23, 11:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Leeroy, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for letting us know that the date for Diesel Plant fitting exams are not out yet however Could you please share the year in which this exam is scheduled ?
21/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 702 0188: November 2024
21/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for clarifying the exam schedule, Leeroy. However, considering that the academic intake is scheduled for the month of September, and students are expected to report to the university campus in the same month, it might pose a challenge if the university allows admissions after November. While we can explore possibilities for a slightly delayed admission, I need to mention that joining the university after November could result in missing a significant portion of academic activities.
21/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before I discuss this matter with the university officials, I would like to gather more information about the exams you have scheduled next year. Could you please specify which course the exam is a part of? As per your application file, all the required documents for the start of your higher education are in order. Therefore, whether or not you take the exam doesn't impact your academic career.
23/11/23, 1:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Leeroy, I hope you are doing well. 

With reference to my previous message, I believe you had a chance to go through them however we have not received your response. Considering the same, I would like to know if you are facing any challenges, I am genuinely concerned and would appreciate it if you could share any issues or concerns that might be hindering our sessions.

If it's possible he will have to come to India in December or he can come the following year that will be from January 2025 . He just has to finish his final year and get his certificate because if he skips the exams , he will have wasted 3 years. This doesn't mean I'll not pay his Galgotias university fee,I will be paying  with instalments so that by the time he will come thar fees will be fully paid

25/11/23, 3:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263777020188, Thank you for letting me know that you are parents are offline right now. Moving forward, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
25/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am I didn't quite understand about that registration fee. The registration fee is $750 but I'm supposed to pay 600 ?
25/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
25/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *November 28th, 2023*

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

25/11/23, 3:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing Leeroy, Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 28th, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
25/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 702 0188: Yes ma'am I'll pay $300 first then another 300 in December
25/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
25/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 702 0188: The payments will be done on the 28th of November by my father from South Africa. He will be using Mama money
25/11/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I have taken note of these details and I will update the university officials accordingly.

I trust that you will keep this in mind and feel comfortable reaching out when needed, right?
