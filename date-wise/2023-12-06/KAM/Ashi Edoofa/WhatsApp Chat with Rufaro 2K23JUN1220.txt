02/08/23, 1:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Rufaro,

I hope this message finds you in high spirits, and I trust that everything is going smoothly with your visa application process. I wanted to inquire if you have managed to complete the visa application form by now, or if you require any assistance with it?

If there's anything I can do to help or if you have any questions about the application, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to support you throughout the process and ensure a successful application at the embassy.
02/08/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Good afternoon @918178723499  hope to find you well. Currently the process is that my documents are heading to Ministry at the moment and once that is done I will be applying for the visa
02/08/23, 2:00 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, @263783495674, and I appreciate you sharing this information with me. I would like to provide you with a recent update that could be beneficial for your visa application. For some students, the embassy has begun issuing visas without the requirement of attested documents. Therefore, if you wish, you can try processing your visa application without getting the documents attested.
02/08/23, 2:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: By opting for this approach, you may save time in the application process, secure your visa earlier, and avoid the additional cost of getting the documents attested. However, please keep in mind that individual circumstances may vary, and if the embassy asks for the attested documents, in that case, you would have to get them attested and then proceed further. I hope you have taken note of this update?
02/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 349 5674: I have taken note thank you
02/08/23, 8:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome. Take your time and complete the visa application form. Once you are done with the visa application form, kindly share the form with me here so I can crosscheck all the details and ensure everything is accurate. This will help us move forward with the next steps in the process smoothly.
02/08/23, 8:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If you encounter any issues or have any questions during the form submission, feel free to reach out, and we will be here to assist you. We look forward to receiving the downloaded form.

28/08/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 642 5580: This message was deleted
28/08/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 349 5674: However we have a question. On the admission letter it states that a fee of USD$2500 is required for On Campus accommodation, is this paid one time or can be done monthly or installments?
28/08/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 642 5580: Tell us the actual amount needed for off campus accommodation and that one for on campus accommodation,,,, how it is paid and how the schoolarship helps because the amounts I'm hearing I can't afford and it's better to call it off,,,
28/08/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 642 5580: And the bank rates and so forth it's now bringing confusion at this last stage when everything has been going on smoothly,,,, now a week to go and things seem to be complicated,,, can it be clear before the boy leaves the country or we cancel this
29/08/23, 2:29 am - +263 77 642 5580: This is absolutely not clear,,, find it awkward to deal with a 2nd year student with such crucial issues,,,, not understanding the sudden payments through Western union,,, a very difficult method of sending money out of Zimbabwe ifever it's allowed to send forex out of Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe provided account number is of different person and the amount is about 550 at the rate of 72per USD,,,, and this 50 USD per week I can't afford this amounts. Can we be clear on this because we thought everything is now ready but the monetary requirements are now out of reach at this point after we thought we paid everything required including the airfares and visa fees in a very transparent manner.
29/08/23, 8:02 am - +263 77 642 5580: Morning,,,, can you attend to my quiries
31/08/23, 12:04 am - +263 77 642 5580: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 12:07 am - +263 77 642 5580: This is what we have been ordered to pay by your student whom you say should do the off campus accommodation. Of late you have since disappeared and nolonger help us. We continue getting confused about the figures being demanded and you have stopped guiding us. We are worried
31/08/23, 11:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Rufaro,

I hope this message finds you well. Please excuse us for not being able to connect with you the past two days, we were unavailable due to the celebration of Rakhi, a significant and cherished festival in our culture.

Rakhi holds great importance in our lives, as it's a time when we come together as a family to celebrate the bond between siblings. The festivities and rituals of the day required my full attention and participation, which unfortunately led to my inability to connect with you.
31/08/23, 11:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: I can see that you have made some amount of payment to book your accommodation. Could you please provide me with the following details for our records?

31/08/23, 11:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, @263776425580, as I mentioned to Rufaro earlier, our unavailability was a result of the ongoing festival season here in India, which made it challenging to establish contact with you. If our lack of communication caused any inconvenience, please excuse us for that.

Since today is a regular operational day, we are now accessible and ready to engage in communication with you. Please feel free to let me know how can I assist you.
03/09/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Rufaro,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:20 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 3:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Rufaro 2K23JUN1220*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.


5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 3:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

I have a crucial update to share with all of you. As you may be aware, whenever one makes an International money transfer, there is an amount charged by the bank which is usually around 18%. Due to exchange in fluctuation, Ms. Eugene has received the less amount needed for your resrvation. 

In order to cover the difference, a payment of $35 is now required to successfully book your accommodation. For more details and instructions regarding this payment, please reach out to Ms. Eugene directly. She will provide you with all the necessary information.

Are we connected?
28/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 349 5674: Good day
28/09/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 349 5674: 1. India is definitely a different experience from my home country. It's naturally high temperatures are going to need to get used to and the difficulty in communication with the locals is a bit of a struggle but however there's always a certain level of understanding. My apartment is alright but however there are a lot of costs needed to be covered while staying here which were not mentioned before and it is a bit of a strain to my parents and myself. I have been to the school yes and explored a bit of the campus, lovely school to be honest but as we await for orientation then I'm sure we will get to know the ins and outs of Galgotias University.


2. I am connected with my mentor but not on a regular basis like we were while I was back in my home country because I still have not settled in well yet. I am not aware of my scholarship credits as yet but I intend to find out.

3. I have unfortunately not adjusted to the Indian food as of yet because it is extremely spicy and I can not stomach spicy foods as it gives me a stomach ache. However i have managed to purchase the necessities for the kitchen which allow me to prepare food that is similar to that from home and is less spicy.
28/09/23, 12:54 pm - +91 93546 23922: Thankyou for sharing your response and I am happy to hear from you
You can connect to your mentor anytime now also I understand you're settling in but make sure to be in touch with her more often and you can ask them your credits anytime!

01/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 78 349 5674: Mr Mukund this boy is not well, are you going to help or do we have to take him to the hospital because there's only much that we can do as students
01/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 349 5674: I sent you this message this morning and still no response
01/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 349 5674: He has a fever, he is shivering and sweating uncontrollably and claims he is cold but he has no energy and will not eat
03/10/23, 7:51 am - +91 93546 23922: Greetings Rufaro, sorry for the delayed response, since we just met in the office and with Anotidaishe, I hope we things are falling into place now
