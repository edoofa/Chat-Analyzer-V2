03/09/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Tonderai,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 2:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 2:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Tonderai 2K22OCT1828*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.


5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India

07/09/23, 5:58 pm - Rithvik Edoofa: Greetings *Tonderai* and Parents,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that *Tonderai* has safely arrived at *MVN*. It's wonderful to have them here with us.

07/09/23, 5:58 pm - Rithvik Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 5:58 pm - Rithvik Edoofa: *IMPORTANT*

Additionally, during my meeting with the students today at *MVN*, I was informed by the university about an important matter. It is crucial that all students clear their dues before this *Saturday*. Failure to do so will result in a delay in their registration process. Please be aware that registration must be completed within *14* days of arrival to avoid any _potential fines_.
08/09/23, 5:32 am - +263 73 371 5747: Okay I want to know if we are still allowed to pay half as we were told that we can make payments in 2 parts
08/09/23, 6:02 am - +263 73 371 5747: Indeed @263733715747. Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $2250, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2250 - $1000 = $1250. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
08/09/23, 6:03 am - +263 73 371 5747: During my counselling session I was told that I can still pay half of $1250 ,does this still stands
08/09/23, 9:24 am - Rithvik Edoofa: Greetings, *Tonderai* and Parents
I hope that you are doing well

As discussed with *Tonderai* during our session, If you want, the payment can be made through *Mukuru*, I am sharing the details below.
Please make sure that you share the receipts with us as soon as you make the payment.
08/09/23, 9:24 am - Rithvik Edoofa: Please do not worry.
08/09/23, 9:25 am - Rithvik Edoofa: Everything that was shared before still stands. The exact break up will be shared with you soon
08/09/23, 9:31 am - Rithvik Edoofa: As discussed with Bruce during our session, If you want the payment can be made through Mukuru, I am sharing the details below.
Please make sure that you share the receipts with us as soon as you make the payment. <This message was edited>
08/09/23, 9:31 am - Rithvik Edoofa: The payment can be made either in cash or through *Mukuru*. Please note that in both cases, there will be a transfer charge of *11%* of the amount you wish to send.

If you are located in Harare and prefer to make the payment in cash, you can arrange to meet him at *Avonlea, 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare*.

Alternatively, if you are familiar with Mukuru, you can choose to make the payment through that platform. I will provide you with his contact details so that you can directly connect with him and coordinate the payment yourself.

08/09/23, 11:19 am - Rithvik Edoofa: Please be aware that there is a one-time fee of $250, which covers miscellaneous and sports fees, applicable only for the first year. This means that the total first-year fee amounts to $2,500. Of this total, $1,000 has already been paid. As a result, the remaining balance for the first year is now $1,500. Currently, you are required to make a partial payment of half of this balance, which amounts to $750.
And for now, You have to pay half i.e. $750
08/09/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 344 4698: Greetings we have already given Tonderai that amount (750) to pay when he reached India. We have sorted it out
08/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 344 4698: My question is when are we going to make the last payment of 750 to close the last chapter of the first year
08/09/23, 11:51 am - Rithvik Edoofa: Can you please ask Tonderai to make the payment of $750 to me.
I am at his hostel only
