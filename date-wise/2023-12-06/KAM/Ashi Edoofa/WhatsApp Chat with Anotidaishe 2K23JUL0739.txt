I hope you are doing well today.

I am Mr. Milan, Senior admissions officer here at Edoofa. I wanted to inform you that there is something very important that I wish to discuss with you regarding your admission journey. Hence, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for that so that we can discuss and plan the way ahead?
24/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 424 5906: Good day Mr Milan
It's been a very hectic week at work. We also had national elections hence most of the government offices were closed most better half of the week

Hoping to finish all the processes tomorrow

24/08/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I wanted to discuss with you an update that I had regarding Anotidaishe's admission process. While processing the application we had also shared it with LPU, one of our partner universities, and unfortunately, they rejected Anotidaishe's application for the Optometry course. 

Hence, do you wish to continue with his admission process at Galgotias itself, or do you wish to explore alternate options in terms of  courses?
24/08/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 424 5906: If there are other cheaper alternatives it would be great,  
However if not we will proceed with Galgotias
24/08/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to the affordability factor, then if you wish to go for any courses at LPU then the costs would be around the same as they are at Galgotias please. Hence, do you wish to explore other options at LPU or shall we confirm Anotidaishe's admission at Galgotias itself? <This message was edited>
24/08/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 424 5906: But I think with the time phrame,  I was thinking maybe if we concentrate on Galgotias. As September is around the corner
24/08/23, 2:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is indeed right. Hence, shall we move ahead to finalize Anotidaishe's admission at Galgotias itself?
24/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 424 5906: Yes Sir
24/08/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please thank you for the confirmation. Let me share the same information with the university officials as well. And from here, you can continue with your discussion with Ms. Ashi.

I think all the documents are in place with the exception of bank statement which has a balance of around 600. In the last
31/08/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 424 5906: In the last 9ne you send minimum balance equal to studenys' fee💁🏾‍♀️
31/08/23, 8:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, @263714245906, earlier the requirement for the bank statement was $500, however, there has been an update from the embassy and now students need to show a balance equivalent to their first year's tuition fee. If you have arranged $600, you can try to process your visa with the same bank statement. Sometimes, the embassy permits this and approves the visa. If the embassy requests another statement, you can try to obtain one. What are your thoughts on this?

They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 13th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
09/09/23, 10:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

09/09/23, 10:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Anotidaishe 2K23JUL0739*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. Make sure to keep $50 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
09/09/23, 10:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

10/09/23, 10:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anotidaishe

I hope this message finds you well. Recently, we had a conversation with the academic board and university officials at Galgotia University, and we received the fee breakdown for your first semester.
10/09/23, 10:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take a moment to review the breakdown below and confirm that it is accurate. If you notice any discrepancies, kindly inform us as early as possible so that we can correct them with the university -

Name of Student: Anotidaishe Michael Chirau
Per semester tuition fee (after scholarship): $900
Per semester exam fee: $100
Total cost of education: $1,000 (tuition fee + exam fee)

It's worth noting that you've already made a registration fee payment of $750 through Edoofa, which has been allocated towards reserving your scholarship seat. Consequently, the remaining balance for your first semester's education is calculated as $1,000  - $750 = $250.
10/09/23, 10:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: In relation to the outstanding semester balance fee of $250, we'd like to remind you that this fee should be settled during the first semester, ideally prior to your arrival in India, 

If the provided fee breakdown is accurate, in that case, we would like to understand the plans you have in place to clear the balance for your first-semester fee. This will enable us to facilitate the payment process accordingly. <This message was edited>
10/09/23, 10:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly confirm the payment method you intend to use for the $250 fee. 

If you want to bring your fee to India, please confirm here so that we can inform the team, and they will coordinate with you accordingly.

Alternatively, if you plan to deposit the fee from your home country, please inform us, and we will assist you with that process as well.

Please remember the significance of clearing your fee. Until your fee is settled, you won't be able to attend your academic classes.
10/09/23, 11:04 am - +263 71 424 5906: Good morning ma'am
