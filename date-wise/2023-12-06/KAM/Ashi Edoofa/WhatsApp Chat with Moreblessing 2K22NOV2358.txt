07/08/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 776 5681: Yes I can

2. $800
3. $1 600
4. $ 250
5. $ 1 000
07/08/23, 11:47 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are certain, dear?
07/08/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 776 5681: I think l am
07/08/23, 11:49 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 10% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $350.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
07/08/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 776 5681: Yes it is
07/08/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes. Indeed. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
07/08/23, 11:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1600 + $250 = $1850.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1600. I hope you are clear about that?
07/08/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 776 5681: Yes that's clear thank you
07/08/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure -

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank 
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
07/08/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 776 5681: Yes
07/08/23, 12:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
07/08/23, 12:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
07/08/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 776 5681: Yes am clear
07/08/23, 12:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1600 and so the balance fee becomes $1600 - $1000 = $600 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
07/08/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 776 5681: Yes I understand
07/08/23, 12:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeed. Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1850, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1850- $1000 = $850.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
07/08/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 776 5681: Yes thank you
07/08/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, to secure your scholarship seat with MVN University, a fee of $1000 needs to be paid. However, since you have already paid $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with PDM University, the total of $750 that you paid for your fee at PDM University will be adjusted against the registration fee at MVN University and hence you would have to pay the difference in fee which becomes $1000 - $750 = $250.

If you decide to change your university and transfer your admission to MVN University, you will have to make a payment of $250 before the 10th of August. I hope this clarifies the information for you?
07/08/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 776 5681: Noted with thanks

05/09/23, 8:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:10 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
05/09/23, 8:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
05/09/23, 8:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Moreblessing 2K22NOV2358*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
05/09/23, 8:45 am - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.
