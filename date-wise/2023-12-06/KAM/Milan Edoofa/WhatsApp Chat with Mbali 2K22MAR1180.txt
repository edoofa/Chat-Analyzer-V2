02/08/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Mbali!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/08/23, 9:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse us for not being able to connect with you for quite some time, since the team was occupied with coordinating the arrivals of the first batch of students who recently landed here in India.
02/08/23, 9:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Mbali, in that situation where you do not have any plans to look even for a local education option, I understand that due to financial challenges this is a setback for you since you are not able to join the other students who will be starting thier higher education here in India this year itself. 

However, I would advise you to have a discussion with your parents as well about what they plan to do further regarding the finances so that we can get to know about their preparations well and then we can discuss & plan the way ahead for your higher education.
02/08/23, 10:22 pm - +263 71 998 8765: Greetings everyone
02/08/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 998 8765: Thank you sir for understanding my situation.

I had a discussion with my family about my higher education and they said they still want me to continue with my studies in India with Edoofa, they said they will be able to raise the outstanding amount in the month end of September and they asked if is it still possible for me to come this year?.

08/08/23, 2:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing an update with me regarding that dear. Now, since you have mentioned that your parents will be able to raise the balance amount by end of September can you please also let me know why would it take them so long to raise the amount deaR?

16/08/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for not being able to respond to you earlier since I was not feeling well and had a high fever and yesterday, it was a national holiday on the occasion of Indian Independence Day! So, all of us were celebrating the joyous day. I appreciate your patience here.
16/08/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. So as per the discussion that you had with your parents, can you please let me know how is it that they are preparing to move ahead with your admission process?
16/08/23, 7:10 pm - +263 71 998 8765: Good Evening Sir.

21/08/23, 4:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delay in connecting and responding to your messages earlier. Unfortunately, after we had connected with each other earlier, I was still not feeling well and faced a serious illness over the past few days. However, I'm on the path to recovery now and am dedicated to assisting you promptly. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
21/08/23, 4:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that they are planning to clear the balance. Additionally, can you please also let me know by when are they planning to clear the balance?

21/08/23, 5:05 pm - +263 71 998 8765: They are  going to make the payment in the end of September.
22/08/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mbali!
I hope you are doing well today.
22/08/23, 3:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is understandable Mbali, however, here you had mentioned that your parents are ready to pay the outstanding amount, then why is it that you are saying that they wish to do that end of September please?
22/08/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 998 8765: Good afternoon Sir
22/08/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 998 8765: That's what they told me when they said they are ready to pay the outstanding amount sir.
They said they are willing to pay the outstanding amount buy they will pay on the month end of September.
24/08/23, 12:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Mbali!
I hope you are doing well today.
24/08/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case Mbali, did you manage to discuss with them about why is that they are planning to clear the remaining amount in September, since we are already approaching the end of the month of August and on completion of the admission process, we also have to work on your VISA and travel arrangements, and since it would also take time, it may add further delay for you to start with your classes. 

Hence, don't you think it would be wise to complete the admission as soon as possible and then move ahead to the next steps?
24/08/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 998 8765: Good afternoon Sir
24/08/23, 1:25 pm - +263 71 998 8765: We had a discussion about it sir, they said that's when they will get the money to pay the outstanding amount .
28/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 998 8765: Good afternoon Sir
I hope you are doing well.
28/08/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 998 8765: You are welcome.
