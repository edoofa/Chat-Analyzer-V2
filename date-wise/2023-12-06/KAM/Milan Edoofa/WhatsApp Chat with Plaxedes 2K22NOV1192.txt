07/09/23, 12:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Plaxedes,

I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?

27/09/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are ready for the session?
27/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good afternoon Sr 
Yes we can proceed
27/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
27/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 690 6202: At this stage there will be two or more university who will interview her and she has to be selected by one university.At this stage the acceptance letter will be offered.
27/09/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
27/09/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 690 6202: That's great news
So happy to hear that .
27/09/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
27/09/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
27/09/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Of course I am ready sir
27/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
27/09/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Have received them
27/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
27/09/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 690 6202: It's clear 
On the issue of statement of entry for A level she has to send it soon
27/09/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we are currently waiting for the document.
27/09/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/09/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
27/09/23, 6:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Not clear here 
You said earlier that in 2024 there is likely to be a 20-30% increase in fees structure 
Then you are saying this increase will not affect us
27/09/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you proceed with the Endowment plan you will be immune to the increment of the fees in the year 2024. May I know if you are clear here?
27/09/23, 7:13 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Clear now
27/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/09/23, 7:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Well explained
27/09/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 690 6202: I understand
Hoping that notice to make payments should not be short
27/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Please do not worry about that, you will be well informed.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 690 6202: You may go ahead and provide me with information sir
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 690 6202: That's good news sit
27/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
28/09/23, 6:18 am - +263 77 690 6202: <Media omitted>
28/09/23, 6:18 am - +263 77 690 6202: Statement of entry

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?

I am travelling right now
03/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 690 6202: If we can do the session tomorrow sorry for any inconveniences

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good afternoon Mr Shivjee
Yes we can proceed
04/10/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
04/10/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 690 6202: I am sure if I get you well
If A level results are good that is if she has attained required points she can proceed with the degree
2 if A level results are not good it means she will study diploma.then later proceed with degree
04/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Number 3 
If O level results and ALevel results are not good meaning she can not proceed
04/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutley correct.
04/10/23, 6:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like you to know that I will be closing our session for now as I have to attend to another batch of my students. Thank you so much for your time, and we shall connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a great day ahead!
04/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Thank you Mr Shivjee
Have a great day too
05/10/23, 3:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good afternoon sir we are all fine
Plaxedes is not around she is at school
05/10/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Thank you for letting me know. If you are ready shall we proceed with the session.
05/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 690 6202: We can proceed
05/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 690 6202: So clear sir
05/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 690 6202: It's clear sir 
So it means she will not be obliged to do the initial applied
She has to choose any diploma
Does this depends with subjects obtained at o level to choose the diploma
05/10/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that will be the next step for the process for the course of the Diploma.
07/10/23, 11:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and my dear Edoofian.

I hope this message finds you well. I regret to inform you that I was unable to proceed with our conversation recently due to unforeseen work commitments that required my immediate attention.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I propose that we reschedule and connect with each other at 3:00 PM on Monday. Your understanding and flexibility in this matter are highly appreciated.

Wishing you a great week ahead, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
07/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 690 6202: Good morning sir 
How are you doing
Here we are all fine.
Noted we shall continue on Monday
09/10/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good afternoon sir 
Sorry I am busy at the moment
May I inform you when free
09/10/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Of course, no problem at all. Please feel free to inform me when you are available and we will continue our discussion at a time convenient for you.
09/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 690 6202: We can continue now.
09/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
09/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 221 4487: I suggest we wait for Plaxedes to finish her A level exams soon such that she can make her final decision since you now have her exam schedule
09/10/23, 6:31 pm - +263 77 221 4487: Am Plaxedes Moyo 's father
09/10/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In eed, we can wait for that and she can make the decision on the universities as well. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 221 4487: Since most of the times my spouse was the one providing answers,  its to my suggestion u wait for her final say, l am out on duty maybe l missed something
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good afternoon
10/10/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Yes we can proceed
10/10/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Can you please let me know if you have any questions regarding how the admission process works and what the expenses will be for both the admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 690 6202: May you explain further on this
10/10/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure! If you decide you don't want to continue with your education or pursue a diploma, it means you're stopping your academic journey. In this scenario, you'll be part of the EWYL program. This program guarantees you cash earnings equivalent to the registration and enrollment fees you've paid. Plus, after completing a year in the program, you'll receive certificates for job-related projects, and the money you've earned will be deposited directly into your bank account.
10/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Okay I now understand thank you
10/10/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
10/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Of course I am curious about the next step
10/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
10/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Ok noted

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for tomorrow at 11.30 AM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 10:02 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 690 6202: What exciting news I am so happy
15/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Plaxedes!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good afternoon Mr Millan yes I went through the offer letter
But at the moment I am.at church
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier regarding the questions that I have asked. May you please go through the same and answer so that we can move ahead with our discussion.
16/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 690 6202: Good morning
I will send response soon it's only that I am busy since morning
16/10/23, 11:46 am - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. May I know by when will you be sharing the response please?
16/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 690 6202: 1. Tuition fee per semester after schoolarship $900
2.Standard duration of course 5years or 10 semester

3.procedure fee $300

4.Registration fee $750
16/10/23, 2:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across five years. This academic journey is divided into 10 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Noted but what I wanted to know how much will she pay after EWL
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, we will discuss that moving ahead during our conversation. Now, Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
16/10/23, 4:35 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Noted thank you
17/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 2:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
17/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Clear
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
17/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Does $200 we paid initial included on this $750
17/10/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please. Let me help you in understanding the same here. The $200 that you had paid earlier was for the Enrollment fee and it was used for you to become a part of the Edoofa Program. Moving ahead, This $750 that we are discussin is the university registration fee, I hope this is clear?
17/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Now clear sir
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
18/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Yes I am in Harare
18/10/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
18/10/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
18/10/23, 3:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
18/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Noted thank you
18/10/23, 3:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Yes you may go ahead
18/10/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
18/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Noted thank you
18/10/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Plaxedes!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good evening sir. 
Is it possible for me to have other option pertaining to universities
19/10/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Yes I will try to be awake
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 690 6202: I am ready
19/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 690 6202: We may continue
19/10/23, 8:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Before we do that, if I may ask are you clear till here please?
19/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 690 6202: It's clear
19/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
19/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
19/10/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Maybe if the discussion can be short because we have no electricity battery about to die
19/10/23, 9:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are about to complete the same. May I know if you are clear till here please?
19/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 690 6202: It's clear here
19/10/23, 9:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/10/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Clear sir
19/10/23, 9:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Pertaining to the fees structure I have understood
But I wished to be given option of other universities
19/10/23, 9:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
19/10/23, 9:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
19/10/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 690 6202: It's clear sir
19/10/23, 10:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/10/23, 5:31 am - +263 77 690 6202: It's clear sir
Good morning
20/10/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Good afternoon sir
20/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 690 6202: I am not aware
20/10/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/10/23, 2:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
20/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Thank you I now understand
20/10/23, 2:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, I believe you have a clarity on the same, right
20/10/23, 10:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263776906202 May I know if we are connected with each other here please?
20/10/23, 11:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: As it's getting late on my end, I'd like to schedule our next conversation for tomorrow at 09:00 AM CAT. This will give us ample time to continue our discussion about the offer letter and map out the next steps in your admission process. I kindly request that you ensure your presence at the mentioned time to make the most of our session. Wishing you a good night, and I anticipate our conversation tomorrow.

21/10/23, 11:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
21/10/23, 11:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

21/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same on Monday and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
21/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Ok noted I will do so
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
23/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 690 6202: Good morning

23/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please I understand. Now, for now, can you please share what were your thoughts on the offer letter?
25/10/23, 5:54 am - +263 77 690 6202: Thank you sir for the wishes
We are all fine
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
25/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Sorry for failing to get in touch with our discussion
I had a tight schedule at work forgive me please
26/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Yes I share with Plaxedes,s father  but was suggesting that the appropriate decision after results
26/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 690 6202: And at the moment I haven't shared with Plaxedes she is at school now
26/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Waiting for this message
26/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Yes that was the idea
26/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Maybe we need to discuss the issue with Plaxedes early Nov
30/10/23, 7:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/10/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I apologize for not responding to your message earlier. When you replied, it was outside of my working hours, and it happened to be the weekend, so our team was unavailable. Thank you for your patience.
30/10/23, 7:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. In that case, if you wish to wait till the coming year, to complete Isheanesu's admission process, then being the Senior Admission Officer here, I would advise you to not do that, since there are several reasons for that. 

1. You would firstly lose on the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting here. 

2. By the coming year most of the students would have completed their admission processes already and in that case you might not get the same scholarship offers that you are getting now. <This message was edited>
30/10/23, 7:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: 3. Moreover, over the past 5-6 years that I have been helping the students in completing their admissions, I have seen that untimely actions in securing the scholarship often leads the students into getting to a position where they lose out on the scholarship seats entirely as by the time they become ready, the seats are already filled in. 

I hope you would understand the same right?
31/10/23, 5:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Plaxedes!
I hope you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 5:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to revert to me here in the group earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion further. May I know if you were able to go through this message of mine, so that we can discuss the same and plan the next steps about your admission process?
31/10/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 690 6202: How are you sir

I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 7:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Plaxedes!
I trust this message finds you well.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 690 6202: Waal happy Dewali to you and Edoofa family
