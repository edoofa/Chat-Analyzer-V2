22/09/23, 9:46 am - Milan Edoofa: Tafadzwa, you know, oftentimes it happens that we hesitate or restrict ourselves in opening up about our situation thinking what the other person will think, or what if the other person judges you and this only happens when things don't work as per our plan. But you know, this actually limits us from exploring other opportunities. It could be possible that there are some new developments or some new opportunities but when we decide not to engage or respond, we lose out on the opportunities. 

So, Tafadzwa, there is one piece of advice which I would like to give you, and that is if you are facing some challenges, or you have made a decision, be vocal about it, discuss it with people who care about you and your career, you never know something good can come out of it.
