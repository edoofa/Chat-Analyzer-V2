I hope you are doing well today.

I have an exciting news to share with you. When you paid the the first part of your registration fee, we shared your application with a few of our partner universities. And I would like to share that LPU has also accepted your application and shared your Offer Letter. Congratulations to you on that! ⭐🎓

I am sending the offer letter here, please go through it once and then let me know when you are done, we will connect with each other tomorrow at 10.30 PM to discuss the same and plan the way ahead for your admission process.
05/08/23, 12:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 574 7523: Good afternoon sir
05/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 574 7523: I don't understand the fee structure for this one 
Can you please break it up for me
06/08/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nicole!

How are you doing today? May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
06/08/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 574 7523: We are fine,thanks and how are you ?
06/08/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes I am available to discuss it in detail
06/08/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
06/08/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 574 7523: 1)$1225
2)5years
3)$200
4)$700
06/08/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 5-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 10 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1225 making your per annum tuition fee ($1225*2) = $2450. Is that clear?
06/08/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yooh
06/08/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
06/08/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
06/08/23, 10:50 am - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
06/08/23, 10:51 am - +263 71 574 7523: Noted
06/08/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675. 

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
06/08/23, 10:55 am - Milan Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.

LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?
06/08/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes
06/08/23, 11:00 am - +263 71 574 7523: I'm not taking this offer,l am okay with MVN university
06/08/23, 11:01 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Nicole, I understand where you are coming from, however, let us first complete the discussion about the offer letter and then you can choose which University you wish to go. Will that be okay with you dear?
06/08/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 574 7523: This message was deleted
06/08/23, 11:05 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes
06/08/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: So, I believe you are clear till here right?
06/08/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes
06/08/23, 11:23 am - Milan Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
06/08/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes
06/08/23, 11:38 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, Moving forward to the registration fee -

The registration fee which we discussed earlier is $700 for LPU, and your admission processing fee is $200, which is one-time payable. To reserve a scholarship seat with the university one has to pay $700 in total and if you see your offer letter. Now, since you have already paid a part of the admission fee earlier for MVN University, and if after our discussion here, you wished to transfer your admission to LPU, then the paid fee will be adjusted for your admission at LPU and then you will have to pay the balance for LPU registration fee i.e. $700. I hope this is clear?
06/08/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes
06/08/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 574 7523: Is the processing fee paid along with the registration fee?
06/08/23, 11:51 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. For now, in order to secure the admission, you will have to pay the registration fee and then the admission and processing fee would be required to be paid once you arrive here in India along with your balance tuition fee. I hope you understand?
06/08/23, 11:55 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes
06/08/23, 11:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, Before we wrap up our discussion on your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to raise?
06/08/23, 11:57 am - +263 71 574 7523: No
06/08/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
06/08/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 574 7523: Okay
06/08/23, 11:59 am - Milan Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students. 

The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

It seems to be a good reputable institute
06/08/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter from LPU with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by one of the top Indian universities and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
08/08/23, 9:04 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/08/23, 9:04 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to have a discussion with your family about your offer letter from LPU by now?
08/08/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 574 7523: Yes
08/08/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Glad to hear that please. Now, may I know how did the discussion went, what were their thoughts on the offer letter?
08/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 574 7523: They said its a good university,but their fee is something we can't afford
10/08/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nicole!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/08/23, 10:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that dear. So, in that situation what have you finalized do you wish to go to LPU or should we finalize MVN for your admission?
10/08/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 574 7523: Please finalize MVN
10/08/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please thank you for letting me know of that.
10/08/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, additionally, since you are aware that you are left to pay $500 towards your registration fee, can you please also let me know by when are you planning to do that so that based on the same we can complete your admission and move ahead to the next steps, i.e. VISA Processing and travel process.

10/08/23, 10:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for the update dear.
10/08/23, 10:50 am - +263 71 574 7523: Okay
11/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 574 7523: Good afternoon sir

11/08/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Since you have made the payment through FBC Bank, the transfer charges for the same would be 11% of the amount that you transferred.

Now, may I know by when will you be clearing that as well so that we can confirm the admission and move ahead to the next steps in your admission journey?

04/09/23, 4:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Nicole,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 01:55 pm at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
04/09/23, 4:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
04/09/23, 4:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Nicole 2K21JAN0875*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. Make sure to keep $30 to $40 additional with you for the bus fare. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India.
04/09/23, 4:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.

06/09/23, 10:54 am - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Nicole,

I hope this message finds you well, despite the unexpected challenges you've encountered on your journey to Delhi. We understand that missing your flight from Bombay to Delhi has caused significant inconvenience, and we are here to provide the necessary assistance to ensure your safe and timely arrival at your destination.
06/09/23, 10:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: First and foremost, we want to emphasize that boarding a train as an alternative is not advisable. Train journeys in a new country can be arduous, time-consuming, and pose certain risks. It may take more than 24 hours to reach Delhi, which can be exhausting and may not guarantee your safety. Therefore, we strongly urge you to communicate with your travel agent and impress upon them that your safety and timely arrival are our utmost priorities. Under no circumstances should you consider taking a train.
06/09/23, 10:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: Instead, we recommend booking the next available flight to Delhi. If you encounter any difficulties or resistance from your travel agent, kindly discuss your concerns with them and involve your parents if necessary. Ideally, the expenses for this flight should be covered by your agent since they are responsible for the initial booking mishap.
06/09/23, 10:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: While we understand that luggage expenses are a concern, please firmly convey to your agent that they should bear these costs due to the booking error.

Should you decide to take the SpiceJet flight departing at 09:00 PM, even though it's a holiday in India, please rest assured that our team will be available at the airport to receive you in the morning. However, if you opt for the train journey, it may not be possible for us to provide the same level of assistance, and you may encounter additional challenges.
06/09/23, 10:55 am - Ashi Edoofa: Your safety and well-being are our top priorities, and we are fully committed to supporting you during this journey. Please maintain open communication with your agent, discuss your concerns with your family, and prioritize booking a flight to Delhi. 

Regardless of the circumstances or arrangements made by your travel agent, please stay in touch with us and provide regular updates on your arrival details. This will enable us to be well-prepared to assist you upon your arrival in India.

We understand the stress and inconvenience this situation has caused you, and we are here to ensure a smooth and safe continuation of your journey to Delhi. If you have any further questions or require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
06/09/23, 4:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nicole

I hope you are doing well, We are still waiting for your response, Kindly share an update with us as we need to share your arrival status with the team and university officials to make sure you arrive in Delhi smoothly.

Your immediate attention to this matter is crucial.
