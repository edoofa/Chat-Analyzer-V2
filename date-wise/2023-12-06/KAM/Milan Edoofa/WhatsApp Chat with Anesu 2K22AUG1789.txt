I hope you are doing well today.

I am Mr. Milan, Senior admissions officer here at Edoofa. I was going through the discussion that you were having with Ms. Ashi and I came to notice that you were facing some financial challenges due to which you were planning to pull out from this year's intake and then come in the next year. Hence, I wanted to have a discussion with you regarding the same, so, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for the same?
24/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Good afternoon to you all

31/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 685 5803: Well about Anesu shifting to next year is because we were not well prepared from all the required documents for him to travel about his finances we as parents we have to work hard for it we want the best for him and that's an opportunity for our son

08/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesuy!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/09/23, 1:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that I had a discussion with the academic board and I do have something to discuss with you on that. Hence, can you please let me know by when can we connect with each other for the same?
08/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Monday at 2:30 pm Zimbabwean time
08/09/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know why is it that we cannot do that now dear?
08/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 685 5803: If it is today we can sir but during the weekend I will be busy
08/09/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, let us move ahead now itself. Now, Anesu, regarding your admission, I had a conversation with the academic board about the challenges that you are facing, and we came to help you with a solution for that please. 

Before we discuss that, can you please help me in understanding more about when do you think your parents would be able to raise the finances required for you to arrive here in India and start with your studies?
08/09/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 685 5803: They are starting to raise the money this year sir. They want to do also some projects which can generate more money.
08/09/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 685 5803: They want me to arrive there when all the amounts are paid up and all the requirements are in place which is next year
09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/09/23, 9:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here Anesu. Now, on that note, I would like to mention that I managed to have a discussion with the academic board about the same, and I do have something to discuss with you. Hence, can you please let me know by when can we discuss that?
09/09/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 685 5803: Today at 4pm sir
09/09/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 685 5803: We are fine and you sir
11/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 685 5803: Yes sir but as we descussed with my parents they are planning for me to come to India next July
11/09/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 685 5803: I am sorry sir for not showing up by the time you wanted to have the descuss I have run a short problem my phone battery is low
11/09/23, 1:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand that. Now, since you have mentioned that your parents wish for you to come to India in 2024, in that case, don't you think taking a term off and then coming to India in January will be a better option for you?
11/09/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Yah it is a good idea sir but as for July it will be okay to my family too
11/09/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is indeed true, however, in that case, you won't have to wait till July to come to India, and you would be able to do that in January itself.
11/09/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Yah the wish was to come in January for to raise that amount by January it would not be easy since I have a little sister who is going to sit for her final exams next year and they start to register it on january so that's why we choose July so that everything will be put in place  and I can come to India without any challenges
11/09/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, Anesu, may I know if you have already discussed that with your parents or are you yet to do so?
11/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Yes sir we descussed a little about it
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
12/09/23, 1:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, Anesu, on that note, I would like to mention that since you are facing financial challenges, in coming to India and starting with your higher education, I took the time to discuss the matter with the academic board, and we might as well have a solution that we can offer to you, but for that, can you please help me in understanding about how much it it that your parents can afford as of now for continuing with your higher education?
12/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Good afternoon sir
12/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Let me share with you sir
12/09/23, 2:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, I get that, however, in order to plan the next steps better, it is important that you let me know of the amount that you can raise per annum for your higher education here in India?
12/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Okay sir
12/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 685 5803: Let me try to reach out to them because now I am not with them
12/09/23, 2:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Please do that and then let me know of the same.

I hope you are doing well today.
14/09/23, 12:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, since you have mentioned that you can raise $5800 per annum for Anesu's higher education per annum, may I know why is it that you are not proceeding ahead with sending him to India now?
14/09/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 685 5803: We are good sir and you
14/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 781 3815: Well sir according to what we have gone through his offer letter we realised that we have to prepare well on his documents.His offer reached us in July and Visa requires 6weeks health papers were not signed so we realised it takes time prepare it hence we asked for your kind understanding for him to enrol for next Admission
14/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 781 3815: I once connected to one of his counseling team informing this changes his father was also involved in an accident sometime in April and things were not good for Anesu until his father was back at work in June
15/09/23, 3:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Were you able to complete the VISA requirements by now though?
15/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 685 5803: So sir since we changed our admission to next year July we did not proceed with the VISA
15/09/23, 3:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is understandable, however, what about the situation that we had discussed in which you can arrive here in India in the month of January 2024 as well?
15/09/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 685 5803: I would prefer July sir
16/09/23, 12:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/09/23, 12:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case Anesu can you please also let me know of the reason why is it that you do not with to move ahead with the January intake dear?
16/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 685 5803: I need to sort out some many things before I come
16/09/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 781 3815: How are you sir well we were not aware of the January intake and also from his offer letter it is valid just for August only and cannot be used for next intake

I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please regarding the intake mentioned in the offer letter, I get that point of yours, however, as mentioned in the offer letter, it is valid for August 2023 intake and cannot be shifted to August 2024 intake, however, when it comes to the January 2024 intake, it is basically a part of the August 2023 intake itself, since you would be completing your year at the same time.
18/09/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would also like to know more about the various things that you mentioned about sorting out before you can come, can you please help me with that as well?

19/09/23, 7:32 am - +263 77 781 3815: Good morning sir how are you,Well since we were not aware of January intake we decided to start a project in piggery,poultry and also into tobacco farming so Anesu is helping us to monitoring it sir,We were in a difficult situation when his father was involved in an accident so we do not want to face the same hence we are into this income projects
