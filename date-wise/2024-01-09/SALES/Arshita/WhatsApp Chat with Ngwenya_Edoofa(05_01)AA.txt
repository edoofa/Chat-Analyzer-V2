05/01/24, 4:06 pm - Arshita: Ngwenya, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form to apply. Can you please tell me: 

1)  *What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*

2) *What are your understandings of the program as per your discussions with Mbalenhle?*
05/01/24, 4:07 pm - +27 84 796 4509: I'm fine thanks and how are you
05/01/24, 4:23 pm - +27 84 796 4509: To answer the first question,
I have always dreamed of studying abroad since I was in primary and unfortunately I was staying at rural areas where we don't access to internet and even cellphones.
So when I grew I got access to a cellphone and I saw adverts on this scholarship and I saw that as a good opportunity for me since I had no one who was going to pay for my university fees to add more the Earn While You Learn program motivated me the most because it makes my learning a bit easier. So I would simple say I saw Edoofa scholarship as a dream come true
05/01/24, 4:26 pm - Arshita: I am glad to see your understanding of the Edoofa program and appreciate your aspirations, let me guide you further to gain more knowledge on this opportunity.
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe with some of the most elite schools. In Harare, we collaborate with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent High, Christ Ministries, Harare High, Mablereigh Girls High, St Ignatius, St John’s* and many others. To name a few from *Manicaland, St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class Academy, Chibuwe High, Nagle House* and so on with the children of the DEOs of Chipinge and Mutare having their children under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools such as *Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Dewure High, Chiredzi High* and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita- Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, *Midlands Province(Fletcher, Regina Mundi, etc). Mathebeland(North, South) we have St Mark’s, Usher High, Plumtree, Sizane High etc.* Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Dignitaries of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. *We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Mrs. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA)* who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2500+ Zimbabweans who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
05/01/24, 4:27 pm - Arshita: *I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
05/01/24, 5:07 pm - Arshita: Are we still connected?
05/01/24, 5:08 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Then to answer the second question .

I understood that Edoofa is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions Pvt .Ltd in India , on my discussion with Mbalenhle I understood that Edoofa scholarship solves the problems of lack of affordability and employability in higher education or the tetiary level.

She even told me about the Earn While You Learn program that is a unique work- study which is going to help me pay for my fees if I get the opportunity to be an Edoofian .
Moreso Edoofa is working closely with Zimbabwe and has got 2500+ students enrolled in the program. I also understood that Edoofa stays with their students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker right from creating the application, applying in colleges , training's and making them job ready .
05/01/24, 5:08 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I'm really looking forward to such an opportunity
05/01/24, 5:09 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that, now to help you become a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

05/01/24, 5:21 pm - Arshita: I can understand that

08/01/24, 9:27 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/01/24, 9:37 am - +27 84 796 4509: Thank you 🙏 I also appreciate your time and your understanding.
I applied for the China scholarship last year and never got a reply and then I tried Edoofa scholarship where I get responses and I really appreciate that
08/01/24, 9:38 am - Arshita: Please understand that foreign education is just one challenge in this competitive world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth faces is employability.We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.Let me share an article that is part of our awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad. Let me know as soon as you have gone through and I will be guiding you through your program details.
08/01/24, 9:38 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 9:38 am - Arshita: Let me know once you are done
08/01/24, 9:39 am - +27 84 796 4509: Ok I will
08/01/24, 9:49 am - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I agree the major problem that we face as youths is lack of employment opportunities. For example us Zimbabwean , there are a lot of Zimbabweans who got the chance to go to universities and passed but they never got employed according to the skill and certificates they have some end up selling in streets instead of being in an office or in any other better places
08/01/24, 9:49 am - +27 84 796 4509: I'm done going through the article
08/01/24, 9:51 am - Arshita: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

*Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)*

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
08/01/24, 9:52 am - +27 84 796 4509: Yes you can explain the course to me because I never got the chance to know more about courses
08/01/24, 9:53 am - Arshita: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters.

08/01/24, 10:05 am - +27 84 796 4509: Thank you for the explanation. On the list of subjects needed I saw law and I'm confused  that the law is a subject you learn at school or somewhere else
08/01/24, 10:05 am - Arshita: If you have understood the course well, can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
08/01/24, 10:41 am - +27 84 796 4509: I understood the course well. If I get an opportunity on the Bachelor of commerce that is going to positively change my life and the people next to me. My career plan for the next 5 years is to push myself to excel in every challenge I'm faced with and take more and responsibility. If I become an Edoofian and the opportunity arose I would of course be interested in further job progression and be able to help my family members financially and even advise the younger generation on how I made it . Lastly I see myself influencing students on the advantages of being an Edoofian especially underlining the fact that it makes employment easier
08/01/24, 10:45 am - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career. I believe you will be researching about the course in detail.

*Now, as you know, Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform.*
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
08/01/24, 11:29 am - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I'm furthely researching about the course. I researched that Indian education is more affordable(most Indian schools charge between$3300 and $7800 per academic year regardless of the level of study)and it promotes a balanced approach to education , emphasizing both academic excellence and extracurricular activities. What I liked about India is that it provides early exposure to various career options and opportunities . Lastly the Indian education is more theoretical that is it is more information based  rather than knowledge based
08/01/24, 11:30 am - Arshita: *1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

08/01/24, 2:32 pm - Arshita: Thank you for waiting. 

Are we good to continue?
08/01/24, 2:34 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Studying in India is going to have a positive impact on my career because it is more affordable. Moreso I understood that Indian degrees are globally recognized which means I can get opportunities worldwide or globally. Studying in India is going make me achieve my goals since it has got faculty expertise whereby educational institutions are highly qualified and they bring industry expertise in the classroom which is going to make me job ready making it easier to get a more secure job
08/01/24, 2:34 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes we can continue
08/01/24, 2:35 pm - Arshita: That is amazing, As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

*By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?*
08/01/24, 2:41 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I'm familiar with that for example the University of South africa a student without a scholarship pays an amount of R126 240 per programme
08/01/24, 2:41 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India compared to other global hubs.

In India, international students face an average expense of *$6000-$8000 annually.* While this is very low as compared to the Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc where the cost of education ranges from $15000-$35000 annually, it is still beyond the reach of many.

With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000 per annum* for the students who are found eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility Check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 2:41 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 2:42 pm - Arshita: *So do you feel the reduced cost of education is affordable to your family?*
08/01/24, 2:47 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes It is affordable to my family since there is this program called Earn While You Learn
08/01/24, 2:47 pm - Arshita: Noted, 
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education as well, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help in reducing their fees further.

Do you know how that is done?
08/01/24, 2:49 pm - +27 84 796 4509: No I don't know how it is done
08/01/24, 2:52 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 2:52 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/01/24, 2:52 pm - Arshita: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

*What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
08/01/24, 2:52 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:06 pm - +27 84 796 4509: The Earn While You Learn program is indeed helping I like the fact that it encourages you to turn every situation into an opportunity . It is beneficiary because it makes a learner gain excellent work experience ,thus making you ready to face the challenges in this world.
08/01/24, 3:06 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:10 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I can see that EWYL is a great relief and if the student is working hard
08/01/24, 3:10 pm - Arshita: Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

*1. Expert Career Counselling:* We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

*2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships:* Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off.

*3. Earn While You Learn:* The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing our students for the real world. 

*4.Higher Education Concierge:* A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.*

After going through these facts that make Edoofa different, which one out of the 4 did you feel is the most significant?
08/01/24, 3:25 pm - +27 84 796 4509: The most significant fact is the Earn While You Learn program
08/01/24, 3:25 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn

08/01/24, 3:32 pm - +27 84 796 4509: This is giving me hope since I can see that some students who are human beings like me were able to earn this much
08/01/24, 3:32 pm - Arshita: As you see, there is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/01/24, 3:34 pm - +27 84 796 4509: My mother is going to help me with the remaining fee but I cannot guarantee that because she is self employed
08/01/24, 3:35 pm - Arshita: I believe you'll be discussing everything with her after we complete today's session. Also, after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know their experiences and proceedings well.

May I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
08/01/24, 3:43 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Me studying abroad is my family's wish because my mother wanted to study abroad but she didn't get that kind of chance so this is going to be huge relief if one of her children make it . My family is looking forward to me making it abroad
08/01/24, 3:44 pm - Arshita: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a well-paying job, which would help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
08/01/24, 3:44 pm - Arshita: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
08/01/24, 3:47 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I know also about my punctuality on my sessions
08/01/24, 3:52 pm - Arshita: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/01/24, 3:53 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:53 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
08/01/24, 3:55 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes you can
08/01/24, 3:56 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid only if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program after passing the eligibility check stage, it includes, 

*Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*University sessions and selection*
*A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout the course of an Edoofian*
08/01/24, 3:56 pm - Arshita: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge due to which parents might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short period of 7 days and for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option wherein if the student is found eligible, instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, *parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days thereby reducing the financial pressure.*
08/01/24, 4:03 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Ok I understand that
08/01/24, 4:04 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 4:07 pm - +27 84 796 4509: We have discussed up to stage 2
08/01/24, 4:07 pm - Arshita: Well, 
We also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1:Connect with a counsellor-* As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Edoofa Scholarship.                        

*Step 2:Eligibility Check-* The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Scholarship Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa-* If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter.

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program-* This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with steps 5 and 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
08/01/24, 4:10 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes you can explain
08/01/24, 4:11 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
08/01/24, 4:11 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
08/01/24, 4:11 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
08/01/24, 4:11 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
08/01/24, 4:14 pm - +27 84 796 4509: Yes I understand it thank you
08/01/24, 5:17 pm - Arshita: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision. Ensure to include these aspects during the discussions:-

*About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Edoofians Employment Ready.*
*Value of the career of an Edoofian after pursuing higher education in India.*
*The financial aspects and how Edoofa brings in affordability and self-financing opportunities for students.*
08/01/24, 5:17 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences,

*Please ensure to go through the FAQ document before the next stage and refer the same to your family as it has answers to most of the queries.* Furthermore, if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note them down and we will discuss them in the next session.

Let me also share a few pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program so that you can witness the exposures and their experiences.
08/01/24, 5:17 pm - Arshita: Let me connect you all with Valerie Rukobo, as she is a Zimbabwean Student who has completed BCA(Bachelor Of Computer Applications) from India through the Edoofa program. She got an internship(attachment) with an Indian Company and is now pursuing Masters's Program in India.

You can contact her and get to know more about the program. You can also request her to share with you her Offer Letter which she got from her Job. I am also sharing the contact of Valerie's Dad who is a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe.
