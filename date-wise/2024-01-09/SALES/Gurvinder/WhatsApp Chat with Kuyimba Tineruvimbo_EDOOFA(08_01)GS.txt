08/01/24, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: Good Morning Gladys, Mr and Mrs Kuyimba!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
08/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Good day Sir
08/01/24, 12:18 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Yes it's Gladys
08/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Gladys,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Noted with thanks Mr Gurvinder
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 125 5134: It's also my pleasure connecting with all of you
08/01/24, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Gladys, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tanatswa, is that correct?
08/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Yes
08/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tanatswa, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tanatswa’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Yes she told me about her Journey Experience with the Edoofa Program. 

I have learnt that Edoofa, is a scholarship program which is Indian based. I heard that Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Edoofa helps in solving the issues of lack of affordability in higher education. I also learnt that Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready.
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, let me brief you more.
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Yes that is very correct
08/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Wow this is so interesting
08/01/24, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Gladys, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 125 5134: Yes Mr Gurvinder
08/01/24, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now Gladys, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

08/01/24, 4:12 pm - Gurvinder: You only have two subjects in A-level?
08/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 71 396 2063: I had a third subject which is heritage

08/01/24, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/01/24, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology*
08/01/24, 4:16 pm - +263 71 396 2063: Okay noted with thanks
08/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
08/01/24, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 396 2063: Yes thank you
08/01/24, 4:17 pm - +263 71 396 2063: Noted with thanks
08/01/24, 9:10 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 9:11 pm - +263 71 396 2063: Much appreciated 🙏
