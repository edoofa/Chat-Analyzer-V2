*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.

08/01/24, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Ashley,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
In order to help me conduct a smooth counseling session, I would appreciate it if you are active for at least 2 hours between *7:30 AM-4:30 PM CAT*.
08/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 286 3286: Ok Mr Gurnvider
08/01/24, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Ashley, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, is that correct?
08/01/24, 11:04 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah it's correct
08/01/24, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 78 286 3286: No l didn't learn about Munashe's journey
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah that what am looking for
08/01/24, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Ashley, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 78 286 3286: Yeah l can be a able to meet the first one but as for the parents am not sure
08/01/24, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: Noted, may I know, why is that the case?
08/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 78 286 3286: They rarely spend their time on their fones
08/01/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/01/24, 11:37 am - Gurvinder: Now Ashley, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
