21/11/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: Yes you are absolutely correct Liberty.
21/11/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: Now let me brief you about the program.
21/11/23, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21/11/23, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/11/23, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 150 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/11/23, 11:13 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 258 8071: That's true , I want to mould myself academically
21/11/23, 11:20 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Cleopatra, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
21/11/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 258 8071: As  for 50  %can  be a challenge for my parents since  my mum who was prepared to support me academically    ,her contract was terminated    so she doesn't have constant salary  and above all  she has the responsibility of  my other siblings who are still at primary school
21/11/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
21/11/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 258 8071: May parents  should also participate as for me to get a full scholarship
21/11/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
21/11/23, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: If your parents participate then the chances of getting a higher scholarship increase.
21/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 258 8071: That will be great
21/11/23, 12:56 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so Cleopatra, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

21/11/23, 1:22 pm - Gurvinder: So Cleopatra, could you kindly tell me how much * Gatsi secondary school* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?

21/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 258 8071: What motivates me behind field of study is     that ,being a girl  child I want to stand for our rights ,in some rural areas girls are still deprived of education ,    when I am done with my professional qualification my intention is encourage all parents to educate both not in favour gender ,  and when  the girl is learned chances of abuse are very low , so my area of interest is in the girl child
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: That is a noble reason Cleopatra.
21/11/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?

21/11/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
21/11/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Do you think you can meet the criteria?
21/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 258 8071: Definitely I will

In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
23/11/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
23/11/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 258 8071: If students are entitled to work study  ,it's good ,since I want to pursue and my bread winner lost her job , I am prepared and sleeve up   for work study inorder to reach my destiny
23/11/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: That is great Cleopatra.
23/11/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Cleopatra what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
23/11/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 258 8071: Well it's fine
23/11/23, 11:09 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
23/11/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 258 8071: Yes it's really important
23/11/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Cleopatra, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
23/11/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
23/11/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 258 8071: So it means failure to be innovative   does it mean I won't be able to get something
23/11/23, 11:20 am - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
23/11/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
23/11/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

23/11/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
23/11/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 258 8071: Having hands on and  being a research minded cadre ,this will help me  to  broaden up  my thinking capacity and come up with best products that can be  of  quality
23/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 258 8071: This will benefit me a lot
23/11/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Cleopatra, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
23/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 258 8071: Well it's fine
23/11/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
23/11/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

23/11/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
23/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 258 8071: From what  you've highlighted  to me ,  yes that's the road that can take me to my destiny
23/11/23, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: Malaila, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant
23/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 258 8071: I will be happy if i  am to be considered
23/11/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Cleopatra, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
23/11/23, 1:16 pm - +263 77 258 8071: Yes ,they will support me
23/11/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
23/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 258 8071: Yes I did
23/11/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
23/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 258 8071: My phone ran out of power
23/11/23, 1:52 pm - Gurvinder: When will you join the session back?
23/11/23, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: Well Cleopatra, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
23/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 258 8071: Thanks same to you
24/11/23, 8:29 am - Gurvinder: Greetings Everyone,

*"All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/11/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 258 8071: Morning  ,how are you sir
24/11/23, 8:38 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
24/11/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 258 8071: I am good
24/11/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session.
24/11/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: Cleopatra as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 258 8071: Today I am having lecturers  starting now     till  4 pm ,so l have no time for the session
25/11/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Cleopatra,
I hope you are doing well and available for the session?
25/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 676 3098: Morning how are you
Yes we are available
25/11/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: I am fine Cleopatra.
25/11/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
25/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 676 3098: The student would end up paying $1500-$2250
25/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 676 3098: Spend**
25/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Cleopatra, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/11/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/11/23, 5:49 am - +263 78 676 3098: Noted

29/11/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Cleopatra, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
29/11/23, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

08/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 676 3098: Oky morning
08/01/24, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: May I know, why have you been so inactive?
08/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 78 676 3098: I live in a rural area and my family depends on me to help with farming in order to cover my school fees. This has put a lot of pressure on me and has made it difficult to focus on my watsaap. I'm reaching out to you in the hopes that we can work together to find a solution that will allow me to continue my education while still supporting my family. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
I
08/01/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: I understand.
08/01/24, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
08/01/24, 11:42 am - +263 78 676 3098: Can you resend the same question
08/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students.
08/01/24, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Don’t you think so?
08/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 78 676 3098: I think so
08/01/24, 11:48 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/01/24, 11:48 am - Gurvinder: Cleopatra basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
08/01/24, 11:48 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
08/01/24, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
08/01/24, 9:27 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
