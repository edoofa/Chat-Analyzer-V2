I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
03/01/24, 10:07 am - +260 97 4206356: Alright you can go ahead. Am her elder brother
03/01/24, 10:10 am - +260 97 4206356: EDOOFA is an organization meant to assist less priveveledged students with scholarships in various fields internationally
03/01/24, 10:12 am - +260 97 4206356: One of it's role is to counsel students prior embarking on their choice to enable them make informed decisions and suit in their careers <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, let me brief you more about the program.
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
03/01/24, 10:26 am - +260 97 4206356: Wow this is great!
03/01/24, 10:28 am - +260 97 4206356: My sister is very much ready
03/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Okay so NAME, as we start your daughter's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
03/01/24, 11:58 am - +260 97 4206356: Yes 100%
03/01/24, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mungala, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?

8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
03/01/24, 12:27 pm - +260 97 4206356: 1. Grade 12 who completed last year

They completed grade 12 but didn't further their education most of them
03/01/24, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Being a teacher yourself, Don't you think that education is the key to achieving success and providing for your family?
03/01/24, 12:41 pm - +260 97 4206356: It is because it helps one to unlock keys in life and survive
03/01/24, 12:44 pm - +260 97 4206356: This is the more reason I want to see Martha prosper in life through education
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
03/01/24, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Can you send her Grade 10 and Grade 12 term results?
03/01/24, 1:07 pm - +260 97 4206356: <Media omitted>

03/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Gavin, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
03/01/24, 1:35 pm - Gurvinder: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

03/01/24, 1:39 pm - +260 97 4206356: She can do Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy
03/01/24, 1:49 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, I will be happy to offer her *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*.
03/01/24, 1:51 pm - +260 97 4206356: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 1:52 pm - +260 97 4206356: Wow.. thank you so much
03/01/24, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: As per the eligibility criteria,  In order to help the students get a quality education and a good quantum of  scholarship, Students should clear the following aspects:

1. I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria, in order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 4 Grade 12 passes.

2. Students should manage to clear our in-house scholarship test and interview process with an overall aggregate of 80% and above.

In case a student has a grade greater than or equal to 6 Grade Description: Satisfactory, then we do consider special recommendations by the School Heads taking into consideration other Extra-Curricular or Sports activities
03/01/24, 1:59 pm - +260 97 4206356: Noted thank you
03/01/24, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - +260 97 4206356: Yes
03/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
03/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.
03/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.
03/01/24, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - +260 97 4206356: This is great
03/01/24, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
03/01/24, 2:54 pm - +260 97 4206356: Yes
03/01/24, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: As a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen for your sister, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Is She willing to give her 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come her way inorder to transform her career?
03/01/24, 3:02 pm - +260 97 4206356: Yes she is
03/01/24, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that She is willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to her study abroad and not in your country?
03/01/24, 3:09 pm - +260 97 4206356: I want her to be exposed to various ways of handling different disabilities unlike being limited to one country. She loves research too from different field regarding this field
03/01/24, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have her maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning for her to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you ask her, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
03/01/24, 3:16 pm - +260 97 4206356: She is actually happy that once given the scholarship, she is willing to plough back to her country by helping clients that require attention either physically and mentally by applying the approaches she'll acquire from abroad. She is actually ready to implement the knowledge she'll acquire from abroad locally to people that will need the services locally
03/01/24, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate her sense of hardworking for her community, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
03/01/24, 3:23 pm - +260 97 4206356: I do agree because without a conducive environment, implementation can be difficult. However, this doesn't mean she should just sit idle. She has to use the limited resources available
03/01/24, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
03/01/24, 3:32 pm - +260 97 4206356: Yes
03/01/24, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
03/01/24, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

“*It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve*”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/01/24, 10:04 am - +260 97 4206356: Indeed, thank you
05/01/24, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: So now Mungala, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
05/01/24, 10:27 am - +260 97 4206356: How is the calendar like. Once programs start, how often are students allowed to break for holidays?
05/01/24, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: Please, students get enough holidays in India.
05/01/24, 11:28 am - +260 97 4206356: Okay
05/01/24, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
05/01/24, 11:57 am - +260 97 4206356: No, kindly highlight
05/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
05/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/01/24, 12:31 pm - +260 97 4206356: Okay thanks
05/01/24, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/01/24, 10:05 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*I would like to inform you that today's session is only till 1.30 PM CAT*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/01/24, 12:01 pm - +260 97 4206356: Noted
06/01/24, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: Mungala, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
08/01/24, 8:29 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 9:21 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
