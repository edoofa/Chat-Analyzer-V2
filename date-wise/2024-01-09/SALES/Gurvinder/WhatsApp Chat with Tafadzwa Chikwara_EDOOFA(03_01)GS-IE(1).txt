06/01/24, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Persistance who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
06/01/24, 12:27 pm - +263 78 405 8407: Yes he did

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
06/01/24, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?

08/01/24, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/01/24, 8:42 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
