*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student Lyosa

Since you have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Lyosa, please reach out to your friend to understand their complete journey and views on the program to attain greater clarity and understanding about the program. In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow afternoon at 12 PM CAT, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counselling session so that we can process your application.

08/01/24, 9:17 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
