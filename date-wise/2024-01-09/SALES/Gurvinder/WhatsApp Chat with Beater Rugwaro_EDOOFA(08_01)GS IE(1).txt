✅I have learnt that Edoofa Program unique program enables the student to bring out the best of themselves. Edoofa provide a program called Earn While You Learn which provide professional challenges practically not only theoretically. In Earn While You Learn program, the students are involved in various skills and then work on projects which are related to employability skills like analytic skills critical thinking and communication skills. 

✅As l want to achieve my goals , l believe that Edoofa Program will help me. I want to be a Geomatic Engineer but due to my family background, we  are poor and my father receives little money which is insufficient,therefore they can't afford my university fee But as Edoofa Program you have a program, Earn While You Learn and l believe that as you accept me my education will proceed. For instance, the program provides opportunities for students to engage in service learning and allow us to gain variable skills while making a positive impact in the community. 
Also l should be accepted so that l can connect with other professionals and like-minded individuals from around the world. Lastly, l should be accepted so that l would develop new skills and knowledge necessary to succeed such as language skills and cultural competency.
