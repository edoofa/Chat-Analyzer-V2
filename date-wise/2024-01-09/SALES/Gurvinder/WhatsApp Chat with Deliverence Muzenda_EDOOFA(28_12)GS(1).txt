02/01/24, 7:59 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

03/01/24, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
03/01/24, 7:58 pm - +263 77 212 5822: Halo Mr Gurvinder, I am Mrs Muzenda, Deliverence's mother. Am sorry for a late response to this important issue. We lost a sister in law and so we were busy with the funeral.
03/01/24, 8:00 pm - +263 77 212 5822: Yes, I am now free to discuss with you about the application, Mr Muzenda is currently out of network but has given me a go ahead with the discussion.
03/01/24, 8:05 pm - +263 77 212 5822: Yes, we had some family challenges and could not get time to participate but we are now ready for the discussion. Is Deliverence not supposed to participate in the discussion?
03/01/24, 8:06 pm - +263 77 212 5822: If she is needed as well, below is her number.
