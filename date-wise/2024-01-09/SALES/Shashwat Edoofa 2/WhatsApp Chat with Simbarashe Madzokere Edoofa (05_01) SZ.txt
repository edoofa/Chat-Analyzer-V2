Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your son is, what are his strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
05/01/24, 7:17 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I am 45 and my wife is 43. Simba is the eldest of our 3 children. 
Our highest level of Education is national Diploma for both me and my wife. I have a Diploma in  Instrumentation and Control while Patience has a Diploma in Forestry. 
I am currently working in South Africa as a Technician on a contract basis. 
We always want to equip our children with the best education hence in 2023 we decided to move our children back to Zimbabwe where we believed they will get better education and also scholarships opportunities if they studied Cambridge examinations.  University education is very expensive in Zimbabwe and South Africa hence we support our children to excel in school so that they can qualify for bursaries and scholarships. 
Simba has always been a keen and responsible student throughout his primary and secondary education and now in advanced level he has improved immensely. 
Through his achievements academically and also his conduct, he has been appointed to be a prefect at his current school.  
So besides being an excellent student he is also a natural leader. He is currently studying Business and Economics subjects at A level.

08/01/24, 2:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Mr. Fortune.
08/01/24, 3:04 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Thank you very much. I am done reading. This is very interesting. I wasn't aware of   a lot of information
08/01/24, 3:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Simbarashe to India for his higher studies!
08/01/24, 3:07 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I am definitely interested sir
08/01/24, 3:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
08/01/24, 3:12 pm - +27 78 003 4261: No. I haven't really looked at it yet. But in SA it's expensive and it can go up to more than R100 000 which is expensive for most parents if they do not get government assistance
08/01/24, 3:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Fortune! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/01/24, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
08/01/24, 3:23 pm - +27 78 003 4261: If we get assistance,  we can try by all means to make sure we can afford the reduced fee. It can be done
08/01/24, 3:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Fortune. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
08/01/24, 3:38 pm - +27 78 003 4261: I don't have an idea. But I'm sure Simbarashe would grab any opportunity with both hands as it will assist us pay for his education while we also continue making sure his siblings finish high school
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Fortune. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/01/24, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
08/01/24, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

08/01/24, 3:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child? <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 3:49 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Yes. Of course this will be be beneficial to Simbarashe because besides earning some credit to contribute towards his tuition, he will also be earning some experience and work in different environments and with different people
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/01/24, 6:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

08/01/24, 6:52 pm - +27 78 003 4261: Yes, it's very clear and I'm 100% sure he will be able to do this. I have a lot of faith and confidence in his ability if he manage to be selected for a scholarship.
