08/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Well received, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

08/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 212 1712: It's nice
08/01/24, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Elton!

Do you wish to join the students at this year's event?
08/01/24, 4:18 pm - +263 71 468 3716: Absolutely
08/01/24, 4:19 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Yes
08/01/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate!
08/01/24, 4:20 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/01/24, 4:22 pm - +263 78 212 1712: I am quite confident
08/01/24, 4:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great
08/01/24, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: You shared your interests to pursue Aircraft/Aerospace Engineering,

May I know more about the same as to what motivates you to pursue the field?
08/01/24, 4:23 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Nice
08/01/24, 4:25 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Since l like calculating and also l really like physics
08/01/24, 4:26 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Aerodynamics studies is the topic l really enjoyed at a level studies l felt motivated to pursue a career in aircraft engineering
08/01/24, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

What all did you research about Aerospace Engineering, Elton?
08/01/24, 4:33 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Yes l watched you tube videos of aerospace engineers
08/01/24, 4:34 pm - +263 78 212 1712: And also watched videos of students at aerospace engineering
08/01/24, 4:38 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So let me help you have a better clarity.
08/01/24, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: Now Elton, looking at your interests and passion for aero planes and aeronautics, let me share with you that we do offer *Aerospace Engineering* but as your counselor I would like to highlight a few parameters

-This is a niche course that has a higher cost of education compared to other branches of engineering and the quantum of scholarship offered is low

- If you opt for this branch, your scope of career opportunities will be confined to the branch of Aerospace/Aeronautical itself. At the same time, if you opt for a degree like *Mechanical Engineering*, it can help to bridge you to Aeronautical, Aerospace, Automotive, etc at the same time helps to fulfill your interests to solve challenges, to bring innovations, and at the same time offering a wider spectrum of career opportunities as Mechanical Engineering is known as the mother of Engineering!
08/01/24, 4:44 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Thank you
08/01/24, 4:45 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done.
08/01/24, 4:46 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Ok l will
08/01/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
08/01/24, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow, Elton?
08/01/24, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/01/24, 6:36 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Yes l did
08/01/24, 6:37 pm - +263 78 212 1712: Ok thank you
08/01/24, 6:37 pm - +263 78 212 1712: I Will be on time
