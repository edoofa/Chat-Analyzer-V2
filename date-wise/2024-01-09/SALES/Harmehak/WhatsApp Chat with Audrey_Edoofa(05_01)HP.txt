You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/01/24, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others.

Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

05/01/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

Surely seems to be a great and dedicated student, Mr Clever!
05/01/24, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
05/01/24, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!*

06/01/24, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I shall brief you about Audrey's desired course.
06/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law. It covers subjects related to Arts field such as Economics, History, Sociology and Political Science etc. alongside specialized fields of law like Criminal Law, Corporate Law, Patent Law, Administrative Law, Tax Law, International Law and Labor Law.

This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.
06/01/24, 6:18 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Great course indeed requiring self dedication and self esteem with a lot of public relations in achieving the goals. In attainment of such a course one would become a valuable "asset" in community and would be able to tackle any kind of legal problems faced in future. 
Thanks for the update 👏👏
06/01/24, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Mr Clever!

I appreciate.
06/01/24, 8:36 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Thanks
08/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 77 261 8946: Good morning. You may kindly proceed
08/01/24, 10:38 am - Harmehak: It's great to have you thoroughly following,

So Mr Clever, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
08/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 77 261 8946: I'm following.
As I understand the program is a 100 % funded scholarship I may as well seek some elaboration on
1) How safe and secure is your program form outside scams
2) What contribution is expected from us as the parents? and
3) Are there any possibilities/opportunities the student can enter or acquire during course of the program to have some cushion financially?
08/01/24, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
08/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 77 261 8946: Okay I follow
08/01/24, 11:19 am - Harmehak: While I completely understand your concerns regarding the authenticity issues of the program as a parent!

Are you aware that Audrey got to know about Edoofa from Esnaty, who is currently in India itself?
08/01/24, 11:19 am - +263 77 261 8946: She said so thanks
08/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Alright please, you can request Audrey to connect you with Esnaty and Esnaty's parents too!
08/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Along with the same where you able to read regarding the program's expand all over Zimbabwe, please?
08/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 77 261 8946: Okay thanks
08/01/24, 11:23 am - Harmehak: Regarding your question 2 and 3, I will discuss as we proceed ahead please.
08/01/24, 11:26 am - +263 77 261 8946: Okay
08/01/24, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

2. *Renowned Institutions:* India is home to highly rated institutions known for their academic excellence and quality of education. Students can choose from a wide range of disciplines, including politics, philosophy, engineering, medical sciences, biology, business, and media/journalism.

6. *Cultural Diversity and Vibrant Campus Life:* India's educational institutions celebrate cultural diversity, providing students with a multicultural environment. Additionally, students can engage in vibrant campus life, participate in cultural festivals, and experience the rich heritage of India.

7. *Affordability and Scholarships:* Studying in India is more affordable compared to many renowned institutions worldwide. The cost of education is lower, and various scholarships, loans, and financial assistance programs are available to support students.

8. *English Medium of Instruction:* English is widely used as a medium of instruction in Indian universities, ensuring a comfortable learning experience for international students.

9. *Research and Innovation Opportunities:* Indian institutions offer opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research and innovation. They can collaborate with experts, contribute to advancements in their fields, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

I have realised a lot of people here are opting to study in India
08/01/24, 11:35 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mr Clever 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 77 261 8946: A lot yes a lot indeed 👏👏

08/01/24, 11:40 am - Harmehak: While I would brief you about the cost, may I know if you are aware of *Kadama Michael Tatenda, 2022-23 Head Boy at Chinhoyi high school?*
08/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 261 8946: I may not know him by name but saw him during one of the days at the School Gathering
08/01/24, 11:44 am - +263 77 261 8946: Would find out through the Head Mr. Chigwa

08/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Indeed, Mr Clever!
08/01/24, 11:48 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 11:49 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 77 261 8946: Okay I really follow and understand
08/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Clever, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 12:04 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Sounds good indeed and great relief🙏
08/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/01/24, 12:22 pm - +263 77 261 8946: I'm clearly following and understanding. You have a well designed Institution with well structured entities that integrate to fulfill the Mission of Edoofa 👏👏
08/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate your kind words.
08/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/01/24, 12:24 pm - +263 77 261 8946: I'm also having a feeling that if such an opportunity had befallen on me I would have been someone somewhere 😁
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Okay
08/01/24, 12:28 pm - +263 77 261 8946: My pleasure
08/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, Mr Clever.

While I am glad you are there to support your children now.
08/01/24, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: Letting them pursue higher education is definitely going to assist them to build great futures for themselves as well as the family.
08/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Thanks also for coming in my family for the great aspirations intended to be achieved for a better and brighter future
08/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
08/01/24, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/01/24, 1:08 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Exactly I really get your uniqueness!!
08/01/24, 1:10 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Mr Clever, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/01/24, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: @263772618946
08/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 261 8946: You may proceed
08/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Helloo
08/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Mr Clever, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 261 8946: $2250 at most
08/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/01/24, 2:16 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Okay
08/01/24, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Mr Clever, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Good motive as a helping hand🙏
08/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/01/24, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/01/24, 2:46 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Okay
08/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/01/24, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/01/24, 2:53 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Sure I really do
08/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/01/24, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 3:39 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Okay
08/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
08/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

08/01/24, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Mrs Ruth for a thorough discussion, Mr Clever.
08/01/24, 3:44 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Okay
08/01/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/01/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/01/24, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
08/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 77 261 8946: Okay thanks. I need as well to get in contact with Audrey and her mum for revision since I have solely gone through the Counseling session as we located at different distant locations at the moment. Thanks
08/01/24, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.

While doing the same do connect with Mrs Ruth for a great clarity from a parent's aspect who has two daughters currently in India!
