Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
05/01/24, 10:35 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Here
05/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I am aware of the same please,

I am referring to your understanding of the sponsoring part.
05/01/24, 10:37 am - +265 989 91 19 12: The scholarship
05/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: Alice, kindly follow the question properly please.

You mentioned scholarship as fully funded in part one.

May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship please?
05/01/24, 10:50 am - +265 989 91 19 12: A fully funded scholarship covers all the expenses associated with your education, including tuition, living expenses, and sometimes even travel costs.
05/01/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
05/01/24, 10:52 am - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand that now thank you for the clarification
05/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome
05/01/24, 10:53 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Alice, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD your previous/current institute charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
05/01/24, 10:56 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright
05/01/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Yes please?
05/01/24, 11:09 am - +265 989 91 19 12: My name is Alice Phiri and I am turning 21 years in August. I have two younger sisters and I am the first born. I used to learn at Hope Fountain Combined school and I graduated there in 2021 with a Bachelor's Degree. The fees was R1200which is around $55 per month. I am currently studying Social Work at the University of Lilongwe and I will be finishing my first year in July. The fees is currently Mk425000 per semester . My strengths are in Essay writing and my weaknesses are in Mathematics and Accounting. I recently started playing basketball and I am yet to join the students welfare committee and Entertainment team. 

My father is a well educated man and is working in South Africa as a Fitter and turner.  My mother is unemployed and she is in Malawi in a village called kukathenthere near Matete. My little Sister Ayanda is in Grade11 in South Africa and the last born is two years and stays with my mother. <This message was edited>

06/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: All the students Alice.

Let me share a document for a better understanding regarding the program.
06/01/24, 11:58 am - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay
06/01/24, 11:58 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 12:04 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I understand.  I've seen Sibo do some videos online
06/01/24, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/01/24, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: It's a 21 page long document, do take out time to thoroughly read the document.
06/01/24, 12:05 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: It means the more she does those projects...the more her fees decreases?
06/01/24, 12:05 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I will do exactly that
06/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
06/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
06/01/24, 3:34 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Okay
06/01/24, 3:34 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: And is it possible for me to get employment there without me having to come back to Malawi
06/01/24, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Well in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
06/01/24, 3:36 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: That's very convincing
06/01/24, 3:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: And Sibo told me that her school helps her renew her visa...if I get the scholarship will we be in the same school?
06/01/24, 3:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm just waiting to hear from my father. He's at work.
06/01/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Every student and application is different,

You receive your acceptance letters as per your application and evaluation.
06/01/24, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Kindly have a thorough discussion, meanwhile the discussion is scheduled for Monday at 9:30 AM CAT.

08/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well
08/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Were you able to thoroughly discuss everything with your parents as a family?
08/01/24, 12:06 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Thanks for that
08/01/24, 12:07 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Not as much. The last time I spoke to my dad he encouraged me to participate so I Haven't spoken to him the whole weekend. He's at work right now and he can't answer
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: Haven't you been able to discuss since Saturday?
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes. My phone was off

I await your response, do thoroughly discuss with your parents!
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Thank you ma'am
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I will give you feedback as soon as possible
08/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
08/01/24, 12:15 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Can I ask one question again
08/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Yes please?
08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Is the fees payable in quarters
08/01/24, 12:32 pm - Harmehak: Let me assist you with the same.
08/01/24, 12:32 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
08/01/24, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Now you see Alice, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/01/24, 12:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I didn't know that you also provide meals for the students
08/01/24, 12:37 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: That's incredible
08/01/24, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: The cost after the scholarship includes Tuition fee, Accomodation and food
08/01/24, 12:49 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Alright then
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: I hope you were able to go through the shared document?
08/01/24, 12:57 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I did
08/01/24, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
08/01/24, 1:11 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: 1.The edoofa program was established to help students with a scholarship to inhance employability for students from Africa . It offers a very structured and practical training to selected  students to increase their work experience.
 
2. The financial aspect of the program entails that students are offered a 50% scholarship (at times a 100%scholarship) and after the scholarship has been given...the learner has to pay for accommodation ,fees and food(depending wether they stay on campus or off campus )
08/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: Duly received,

I believe you understood the following too?
08/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 1:19 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: What are the basic university expenses
08/01/24, 1:19 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I understood
08/01/24, 1:20 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I have chosen the $1500-$2000
08/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Can you elaborate?
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Basic university expenses like Library, Gym, Laundry, Wifi.
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Noted
08/01/24, 1:22 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I meant 1500-3000
08/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the same, Alice?
08/01/24, 1:27 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes I did ma'am
08/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you with $1500-2000 a year, Alice?
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes
08/01/24, 2:01 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: They are
08/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Did you discuss with your parents too, Alice?
08/01/24, 4:27 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/01/24, 8:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: Yes i did
08/01/24, 8:21 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: They both agreed
08/01/24, 8:22 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: I'm not sure I will be available since I'm on 12% and there is still no power here
08/01/24, 8:22 pm - +265 989 91 19 12: But I will try to charge my phone
08/01/24, 11:26 pm - Harmehak: You can request them to acknowledge the same using a voice note.
