She also said she knows someone who got a scholarship from Edoofa Scholarship Program 
So she then gave me the form to fill in 
Basically that is all that I know for now
08/01/24, 10:01 am - +263 77 515 5638: Thank you for having me
08/01/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Well received, Rudo, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 944 6200: Oh Wow
08/01/24, 10:07 am - +263 78 944 6200: There is great competition indeed 50,000 applications that is a lot 

I see Edoofa is helpful indeed
08/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I appreciate!
08/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 10:13 am - +263 78 944 6200: Yes 
I really need it otherwise I might not further my studies
08/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Rudo, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Makumbi high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 944 6200: My name is Rudo Mwanza
I am a girl aged 19 and I live in Harare with my mother 
I did my O level at Chinhoyi High School 
And I finished my A level at Makumbi high school 
I’m waiting for my results and from rumors they might come out any time soon.
At Makumbi high school the fees was $512 including boarding fee and tuition fee 
My hobbies are reading novels,baking and watching movies 
My strength is in writing and leadership for l was a prefect at my previous school 
My other strength is in interaction. I believe l am a social person and I love helping others 

My weakness is that I talk fast sometimes and lm scared of heights 

I wish to study law or social work if God permits 


I come from a family of three 
Two girls and one boy and l am the youngest of the three 
My mother is a housewife 
My father was a security guard but now he is self employed (buying and selling )
For my siblings my sister failed her O level and could not continue 
My brother worked so hard and managed to finish his Masters degree with the Midlands State University here in Zimbabwe
08/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Rudo, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

May I know what are your elder siblings doing currently?
08/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 944 6200: Thank you
08/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 78 944 6200: Ok my sister is married and is not working 
My older brother is looking for a job since he just finished his masters degree
08/01/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
08/01/24, 10:37 am - Harmehak: Well Rudo now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
08/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 78 944 6200: Yes I believe it is surely a life Chan decision 
Honestly speaking growing up in a family where my parents worked an extra mile to get me where I am right now getting a scholarship and studying abroad will probably change our lives not just mine but even that of my family 
And also Zimbabwe honestly speaking is hard we are growing in a difficult economy where job opportunities are scarce my brother has a masters degree but is struggling to find a job so l believe studying abroad will open doors for me and who knows probably l will have so many Job opportunities abroad than here
08/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: You see, Rudo, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
08/01/24, 10:50 am - +263 78 944 6200: Very very challenging 
I just thank God that l managed to finish my A level because so many of my friends could not proceed after O level and they are married now
08/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Rudo.
08/01/24, 10:52 am - Harmehak: Rudo, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 944 6200: My parents are in full support 
Being the youngest in the family my parents want nothing but the best for me 
When I told my mom about this Edoofa program she was delighted 
She has not stopped praying for everything to go well 
She is willing to sacrifice anything for me to further my studies and have a good future
08/01/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I appreciate their thorough and dedicated support, Rudo.
08/01/24, 11:00 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?
08/01/24, 11:00 am - +263 78 944 6200: Me too

08/01/24, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Received please

I appreciate your kindness.
08/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Sure please
08/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 78 944 6200: <Media omitted>

08/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Received please
08/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Now let me brief you about your desired course.
08/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 78 944 6200: Okay

The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

08/01/24, 12:03 pm - +263 78 944 6200: No I don’t
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 12:05 pm - +263 78 944 6200: 6000 per year or ?
08/01/24, 12:06 pm - Harmehak: Per year without any scholarship.
08/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 944 6200: And with scholarship
08/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Oh nice
08/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same too?
08/01/24, 12:11 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Oh good
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Rudo, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Sorry?
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: I was referring to the costs.
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Now I understand
08/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 944 6200: This is amazing and helpful 
I think it really makes life easier for us
08/01/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Rudo!
08/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 78 944 6200: 😊
08/01/24, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: Rudo, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/01/24, 12:20 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Yes l agree 

It’s quite expensive here
08/01/24, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Rudo?
08/01/24, 12:21 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Yes I am
08/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/01/24, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/01/24, 12:25 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Amazing
08/01/24, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/01/24, 12:29 pm - +263 78 944 6200: This is good
08/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

You can go through the other resources meanwhile.
08/01/24, 12:42 pm - +263 78 944 6200: I think it’s because of the network 
I’ll keep on trying
08/01/24, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand,

Meanwhile, have you followed the other resources and information discussed so far?
08/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Oh l managed to open the pictures 
Wow that’s a lot of money up to 1,000
08/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
08/01/24, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: The video will help you with a great understanding as well!
08/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 78 944 6200: I’ll keep on trying
08/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: I understand
08/01/24, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Rudo, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Ok
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Yes
08/01/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: Rudo, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/01/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 78 944 6200: $1,500 to $2,250
08/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Okay
08/01/24, 1:16 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/01/24, 1:17 pm - +263 78 944 6200: So after paying am l guaranteed a place or l might be unlucky
08/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: You pay only if you are found eligible and you receive an acceptance letter.

Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission.
08/01/24, 1:21 pm - +263 78 944 6200: It depends if the parents can even get the 350 knowing that the place is there 
That is what I think
08/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Oh that’s good then
08/01/24, 1:22 pm - Harmehak: Can you properly rephrase your thoughts for me so that I am in a better position to understand and assist you?
08/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Sorry my network connection is a bit slow
08/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 78 944 6200: No you have explained here 
Thank you
08/01/24, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I do understand.
08/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Thank you
08/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 78 944 6200: I’ve never heard of such 😭😭this is amazing
08/01/24, 1:31 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Rudo.
08/01/24, 1:32 pm - +263 78 944 6200: REALLY
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
08/01/24, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Yes
08/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 78 944 6200: How long does it take to get to step two
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: We shall begin with the same tomorrow itself.
08/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Oh ok 
On WhatsApp ?
08/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Here in this group itself.

However if you would qualify for the interview stage, it would happen in your separate Interview Group.
08/01/24, 1:38 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Ok understood
08/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Did you follow step 6?
08/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Registration fee is the $350 dollars 
Am l correct
08/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Oh l see 500
08/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: The enrollment fee is $350.
08/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Ok ok understood
08/01/24, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: However the registration fee is not a separate fee and is rather waived off from your first year's tuition fee itself.
08/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Sorry can you please explain a bit in this part please
08/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Really
08/01/24, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: For students who apply by themselves, they have to pay a separate registration fee ranging between $500-1000.

However for our Proud Edoofians, registration fee is not a separate fee and is rather waived off from student's First year's tuition fee.

In conclusion, you donot pay an added fee.
08/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

08/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, you can connect for a great clarity from a parent who has two daughters currently in India!

Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
08/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Ok does she know that l will be contacting her
08/01/24, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: You can request her for a discussion and she shall assist you once available!
08/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Ok
08/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: As of now do you have any queries for me, Rudo?
08/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 78 944 6200: Aaaah no 
I’m satisfied with the discussion
08/01/24, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
08/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 78 944 6200: I just want to know what is next after this
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Tomorrow we shall begin with Stage 2
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Tomorrow, on “09-01-23” at 10:30 A.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, we would proceed ahead and we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
