For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 3:47 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

07/12/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: Geology and bachelors in Geography are two related fields of study. Both disciplines focus on the study of the physical features of Earth, such as its landforms, soils, rocks, and other materials, as well as its atmosphere and oceans.

Geologists and Geographers both use maps and other geographical tools to study Earth's physical features. Geologists use maps to identify different types of rocks, soils, and other materials that are found in a particular area. Geographers use maps to identify landforms, population distributions, and other features of a particular region.

Both Geology and Geography involve the study of Earth's physical features in the context of the environment. Geologists focus on the physical processes that shape Earth's features, while Geographers focus on the interplay between physical features and human activities.

Both disciplines make use of a variety of research methods. Geologists collect and analyze samples of rocks, soils, and other materials to gain insight into the physical processes that shape Earth's features. Geographers collect and analyze data related to population distributions, land use patterns, and other features of a particular region.

In conclusion, Geology and Geography are closely related fields of study. They both involve the study of Earth's physical features in the context of the environment. They both make use of a variety of research methods to gain insight into the processes that shape Earth's features.

03/01/24, 1:25 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
03/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Oh thank you for this I didn't know
03/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you could learn more, Panashe!
03/01/24, 1:30 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow all the resources?
03/01/24, 1:31 pm - +263 71 678 3196: I am still goin through them
03/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Yes I am done reading the good about India ,some that I knew and some that I didn't know
03/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
03/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Yes I read that the cost ranges from $8000 - 12000 per year
03/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
03/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
03/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/01/24, 1:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 678 3196: India is really much affordable indeed
03/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Ok ok
03/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
03/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Panashe! <This message was edited>
03/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 678 3196: I think the earn while you learn is the best and can make education much affordable
03/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 71 678 3196: The remaining annual fee is really much affordable
03/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
03/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

03/01/24, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Ok I now clearly understand about the earn while you learn in detail
03/01/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: That's great
03/01/24, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/01/24, 1:58 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Alright this is good and motivational indeed
03/01/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: I am glad
03/01/24, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 71 678 3196: That's it I am now awre
03/01/24, 2:08 pm - +263 71 678 3196: I am sure to do so when I finally come
03/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
03/01/24, 2:12 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Yes let's goo
03/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: Panashe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
03/01/24, 2:12 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 71 678 3196: For about 1500
03/01/24, 2:14 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Am I to write this statement now?
03/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/01/24, 2:15 pm - Harmehak: No please
03/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Ok
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Ok ok
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Oh ok I see
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
03/01/24, 2:20 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Yes this is really good
03/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Oh ok there is also visa assistance
03/01/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
03/01/24, 2:22 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Edoofa is amazing
03/01/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their O-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final O level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
03/01/24, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 678 3196: I barely understand please
03/01/24, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: The $350 enrollment fee is paid in two installments after you are found eligible.
03/01/24, 2:27 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Alright that's great
03/01/24, 2:28 pm - +263 71 678 3196: The first installment within 7 days and the other before 30 days
03/01/24, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
03/01/24, 2:29 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Ok thank you please
03/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
03/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
03/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
03/01/24, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 71 678 3196: How do you do the ellegibility test and interview
03/01/24, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: Test would be done in this group itself,

Interview would be done with you and your parents through a video call and voice notes.
03/01/24, 2:33 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Oh ok I understood
03/01/24, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/01/24, 2:37 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Ye I do have understood clearly
03/01/24, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

03/01/24, 2:55 pm - +263 71 678 3196: It is affordable I see
03/01/24, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!
03/01/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
03/01/24, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

03/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/01/24, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

04/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: I appreciate
04/01/24, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

D) supplement, which provides an important element of their diet.

7.can pollute waterways
A) NO CHANGE
B) can pollute waterway’s,
C) could have polluted waterways,
D) has polluted waterway’s,

"My Inspirational Story"
04/01/24, 11:34 am - Harmehak: All the best Panashe
04/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 71 678 3196: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 11:36 am - +263 71 678 3196: Thank
04/01/24, 11:37 am - Harmehak: I do appreciate your acknowledgement, Ma'am!
04/01/24, 11:38 am - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

It is believed that many African countries are not yet deloved because of less production system in Agriculture to promote their diets ,However it is. Not true that many African countries have poor diets beacause their farms are stagnant and inefficient 

To a greater extent African farms has been the reason of Africa sustaining there these poor diets are being caused by lack of reasources like fertilizers and lack of education ,knowledge and skills 
African farms are fertile enough to produce higher yields as a matter of fact they have not used this as an advantage thus they have seen their land very useless to them 
The African society farms and land are not stagnant and inefficient beacause many European countries and individuals from Europe are re locating to these African countries to to do farming and agriculture inorder to improve their diets 
We take for example Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe is an African country that is located in the southern Africa society and it is believed to be the bread basket of Africa thus the African farms are efficient enough in promoting good healthy and diets .On the same field we take a look at Botswana ,it is also a productive county in the SADC that is believed in rearing cattle for drought power, growing drought resistant crops like wheat sorghum ,millet and rapoko and this is a clear definition that Africa do not have poor diets because their farms are stagnant and inefficient but it is just the lack of knowledge,skills and passion

Africa is well known in Agriculture,hoticulture ,using their farms ,therefore they sell all their products remaining none of it for their consumption and this is the clear reason why they are facing poor diets not because because of their farma but lack of skill and critical thinking

However to a lesser extent their  farms may be the reason for their poor diets because of the unavailability of inputs like fertilizers,manure ,seeds, pesticides ,herbicides  and they are not practicing crop rotation inorder to increase soil fertility ,therefore their farms have become stagnant and inefficient causing their poor diets and a malnutrition

My inspirational story
*The life of Strive Masiiwa *

Strive Masiiwa inspires me the most when it comes to motivation and inspiration ,for they say it does not only take the bling of an eye to become successful but requires patience and hardwork .

Strive Masiiwa was a local man that everyone knew not beacause of wealth but because of his poor background 

Strive Masiiwa had always wished for tele communication and networking ,one day on his way to his work place he found a well wisher who helped him start up his own and do his inventions, as it seemed smoother his past was even much better ,

The problem was now on how to register his own company known as *Econet* a local networking system .
He faced resistance,he struggled a lot to register his company but patience ,hope and faith kept his continuity,he started to attend some conferences where he had a chance to meet  some whites who helped him with finances inorder for his continuity.
Strive had patience beacause he knew someday it will come.to.pass .
To register his company that was the difficult one as they wanted proof of efficience of his company 
Someday his wish came to.pass as he now registered his company and it is one of the Biggest networking systems in Zimbabwe 
Strive Masiiwa is.now one of the billionaires in Zimbabwe all from hard work and patience accompanied by hope.and faith 


This.inspires me to work hard sometimes I feel like.giving up and I always make sure I set my objectives to achieve my goals
04/01/24, 2:10 pm - Harmehak: Received Panashe,

Let me get it evaluated!
04/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Thank you I am done
04/01/24, 2:10 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Thank you please
04/01/24, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
04/01/24, 4:53 pm - +263 71 678 3196: Good afternoon
04/01/24, 5:51 pm - Harmehak: Good Afternoon Panashe
04/01/24, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
04/01/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
04/01/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
04/01/24, 5:56 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 10th or 11th January 2024 for $200 and the  10th or 11th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 10th or 11th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

06/01/24, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: I did discuss about your application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. 

However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider your Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. *As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days.
