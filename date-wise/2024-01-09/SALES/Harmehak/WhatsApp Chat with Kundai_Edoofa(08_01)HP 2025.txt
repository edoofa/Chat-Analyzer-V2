08/01/24, 9:44 am - Harmehak: Alright so Kundai, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Claire!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
08/01/24, 9:50 am - +263 71 256 8023: My understanding about the Edoofa Scholarship Program is that it is a program that helps in assisting students from Africa in studying abroad, India to be specific. It helps students in understanding the benefits and what they can gain abroad. It helps one to understand more about his/her dream job or what one wishes to study. It also teaches you how to earn while you are still learning.
08/01/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Well received, Kundai, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/01/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 256 8023: Thank you
08/01/24, 9:59 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
08/01/24, 10:00 am - +263 71 256 8023: Yes, it can make their life easier. <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 10:02 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Kundai, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
08/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 71 256 8023: My name is Kundai Katayi. I'm a girl aged 18 years. I wrote my O level examinations in 2022 and came out with a total of 11 subjects. I'm now an upper 6 student at Thornhill High School in Gweru, where l commute to school daily. I am a prefect at my school which is helping me in achieving leadership skills. I am a commercial student doing a combination of Mathematics, Accounting and Economics. I wish to study acturial sciences. I'm really good with numbers and calculating and my weakness is that l'm not that good at subjects that involve a lot of reading eg literature. I like reading and playing volleyball.

I live in Clifton Park with both my parents and l have 2 older sisters and a younger brother who's doing form 3. My older is married and the other one is doing her 3rd year at Midlands State University. My parents are both self employed. My father is an auto electrician and my mother is a tailor. They both work in Gweru. <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Kundai, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

What is your sister currently pursuing at MSU?
08/01/24, 10:19 am - +263 71 256 8023: She's doing Development Studies
08/01/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: That's great
08/01/24, 10:19 am - Harmehak: Well Kundai now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
08/01/24, 10:20 am - +263 71 256 8023: Thank you
08/01/24, 10:23 am - Harmehak: Please!
08/01/24, 10:23 am - +263 71 256 8023: I do believe that studying abroad is a life changing decision because it can open eyes to many different ways of living and promotes understanding and tolerance. It promotes global engagement and exposure. You can learn about different cultures of people and experience a different way of life which broadens a person's horizons and helps in appreciating diversity. Studying abroad promotes exposure to new cultures, languages and way of thinking.
08/01/24, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Kundai!

Would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
08/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 71 256 8023: Yes l definitely am prepared
08/01/24, 10:28 am - Harmehak: Kundai, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
08/01/24, 10:33 am - +263 71 256 8023: My family members are aware of my plans to study abroad and they are willing to support me mentally and financially they might face some challenges because they will be paying for my sister's university fee which is very expensive, my younger brother's fee and  also my fees. Which is why I think they might need some assistance because of our country's economic situation. But l'm sure they are going to try by all means for me to reach my dreams and achieve my educational goals.
08/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I do appreciate their support for their children!
08/01/24, 10:36 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
08/01/24, 10:38 am - +263 71 256 8023: I am confident that l can attain maximum points.
08/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: That's great
08/01/24, 10:39 am - Harmehak: So, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Actuarial sciences?
08/01/24, 10:45 am - +263 71 256 8023: I had a total of 11 subjects, 3 A's, 6 B's and 2C's. I am motivated to study Acturial sciences by my ability of being good with calculations and it was my dream to study acturial sciences which made choose the combination that l'm doing.
08/01/24, 10:50 am - Harmehak: Well received, Kundai.

It's great to know of your interests!
08/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Let me help you have a better clarity regarding your desired field.
08/01/24, 10:51 am - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
08/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 256 8023: Thank you for making me have a better understanding.
08/01/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
08/01/24, 10:59 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome, 

You see, Actuarial Science is not a bachelor's or master's course, rather it is a certification that a student can pursue alongside pursuing their Degree, so what over here I was briefing you about is that the course of Bachelor in Commerce has several specializations, you can specialize in Finance and Accounting starting from the second year of their course. 

Along with this degree you can pursue the certification of Actuarial Sciences itself.
08/01/24, 11:02 am - +263 71 256 8023: Ok l understand.
08/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: Now shall I brief you about Bachelors in Commerce, Kundai?
08/01/24, 11:06 am - +263 71 256 8023: Yes please.

08/01/24, 11:14 am - +263 71 256 8023: Oh, thank you very much now l understand which program l have to do. Which makes me wonder. Is it possible  for me to make changes on my application form because l chose business administration without enough  knowledge about acturial sciences. <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I do understand please.

So which out of the two do you wish to pursue as we speak?
08/01/24, 11:16 am - +263 71 256 8023: Bachelor's of Commerce
08/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
08/01/24, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Alright Kundai, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/01/24, 11:23 am - +263 71 256 8023: If l get into Edoofa's program l can see my self achieving my goal which becoming an acturial scientist. I can come out with good results because l won't have to worry about our financial situation which leads me into excelling. I see my self doing my dream job in 5 years.
08/01/24, 11:28 am - Harmehak: That is really great Kundai, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/01/24, 11:34 am - +263 71 256 8023: I want to study abroad because l believe that it can promote me with global engagement and exposure. I can learn about different cultures and different ways of living. It helps me because l can gain a global perspective while earning credits towards my degree. Helps me to gain intercultural communication, foreign languages, adaptability and problem solving
08/01/24, 11:39 am - Harmehak: That is wonderful, I can see you are looking for maximum exposure, Kundai 

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
08/01/24, 11:46 am - +263 71 256 8023: Studying in India can help me achieve my dream because I learnt that lndia is a diverse country with many different communities, languages and religions which makes studying in lndia a great way in immersing myself in a new culture.
08/01/24, 11:47 am - +263 71 256 8023: And it's universities offer a wide range of courses at affordable prices.
08/01/24, 11:49 am - +263 71 256 8023: And lndia is also known for its academic excellence which makes me want to study there
08/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: I am glad you have awareness, Kundai!
08/01/24, 11:51 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

08/01/24, 12:00 pm - Harmehak: I am glad you found it helpful, Kundai

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/01/24, 12:02 pm - +263 71 256 8023: I am not familiar with the costs. May you help me in understanding the costs of higher education in lndia
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 12:07 pm - +263 71 256 8023: It is indeed affordable after the scholarship. Thank you for familiarizing me with the costs.
08/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
08/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Kundai, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
08/01/24, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for higher quantum of Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.

What are your thoughts on the same?
08/01/24, 12:12 pm - +263 71 256 8023: It is really a great offer and it can motivate a student to aim for maximum results so as to minimize the fee.
08/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate, Kundai.
08/01/24, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Kundai, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/01/24, 12:16 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Yess l would agree. The cost of living is really expensive in Zimbabwe
08/01/24, 12:17 pm - Harmehak: Indeed!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Kundai?
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Yes now l understand better and l can see that it is really affordable to learn in India.
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/01/24, 12:23 pm - +263 71 256 8023: I understand, thank you
08/01/24, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 71 256 8023: I can see that the earning while learning program is really helpful.
08/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
08/01/24, 12:39 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Yes I'm ready
08/01/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Rutendo, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
08/01/24, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - +263 71 256 8023: $1500-$2250
08/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
08/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 12:46 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
08/01/24, 12:49 pm - +263 71 256 8023: That's really great of you to make it affordable.
08/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
08/01/24, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
08/01/24, 12:51 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Yes l do.
08/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
08/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/01/24, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/01/24, 12:54 pm - +263 71 256 8023: I understand
08/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
08/01/24, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
08/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
08/01/24, 12:59 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Yes l do understand
08/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
08/01/24, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:02 pm - +263 71 256 8023: I understand
08/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
08/01/24, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:05 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Thank you
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - Harmehak: Do connect, Mrs Ruth with your parents too, Kundai!
08/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Ok l will
08/01/24, 1:07 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
08/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Thank you, l understand
08/01/24, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: So Kundai, as of now do you have any queries for me?
08/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 256 8023: No l don't have any queries
08/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, Kundai!
08/01/24, 1:14 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Kundai_Edoofa(08/01)HP" to "Kundai_Edoofa(08/01)HP 2025"
08/01/24, 1:15 pm - Harmehak: You can connect your parents with Claire and Claire's parents too!
08/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 71 256 8023: Ok thank you so much
08/01/24, 1:19 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
08/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
08/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
08/01/24, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
