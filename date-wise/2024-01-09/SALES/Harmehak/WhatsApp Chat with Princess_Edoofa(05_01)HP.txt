05/01/24, 3:08 pm - +263 77 544 5199: So the previous time we wanted Actuarial science but you said you didn't offer it. 
And then we opted for Electrical engineering next but it didn't sit well with Princess
05/01/24, 3:08 pm - Harmehak: While I completely understand, Mrs Leorcardia and I would help you with more clarity regarding the same as well.

Don't you believe you could have informed to get a better clarity then itself?

Meanwhile do you have any other queries please?

05/01/24, 3:20 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please!

Meanwhile, first shall I brief you about Bachelors in Pharmacy or I shall provide you with a better clarity for Actuarial Sciences?
05/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 544 5199: Both please
05/01/24, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
05/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor's degree in Commerce can provide a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences. Actuarial Sciences is the study of mathematical and statistical methods for assessing risk in the insurance and financial industries. Here are the steps that one can follow to work in Actuarial Sciences after pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Commerce:

Obtain actuarial certification: Actuaries are required to obtain professional certification from actuarial organizations, such as the Society of Actuaries (SOA) or the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). To obtain certification, actuaries must pass a series of exams that cover mathematical, statistical, and actuarial concepts.

Gain relevant experience: Actuaries are expected to have a strong understanding of the insurance and financial industries, as well as a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistics. To gain relevant experience, one can start working as a trainee in an insurance or financial services company and gain hands-on experience in actuarial work.

Network with other actuaries: Actuaries work in a close-knit community, and networking with other actuaries can help to expand one's knowledge and opportunities for growth. Actuaries can attend professional development events, join professional organizations, and participate in online forums to connect with other actuaries.

Continuously update knowledge: Actuarial Sciences is a rapidly evolving field, and it is important for actuaries to stay up-to-date with new developments and techniques. Actuaries can attend professional development events, participate in continuing education programs, and stay informed of industry news and trends.

In conclusion, a Bachelor's degree in Commerce provides a strong foundation for a career in Actuarial Sciences, but it takes dedication and hard work to succeed in this field. Actuaries are expected to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, and the insurance and financial industries, and must continuously update their knowledge to stay relevant in the field.
05/01/24, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Let me help you have an even better clarity that,

Actuarial Science is not a bachelor's or master's course, rather it is a certification that a student can pursue alongside pursuing their Degree, so what over here I was briefing you about is that the course of Bachelor in Commerce has several specializations Princess can specialize in Finance and Accounting starting from the second year of their course. 

Along with this degree she can pursue the certification of Actuarial Sciences itself. <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 3:24 pm - +263 77 544 5199: OK noted

05/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 73 658 6720: I'm well thanks,  how are you?
05/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Meanwhile, I hope now you have a better clarity as to why Princess was counseled to pursue Bachelor in Commerce as per her interests please?
05/01/24, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well, thank you!
05/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 544 5199: Yes
05/01/24, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: Great!

Now let me brief you about Bachelors in Pharmacy so that you and Princess can take a thorough decision.

05/01/24, 3:42 pm - +263 77 544 5199: Ok understood
05/01/24, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Now that we have discussed about both her desired courses,

Kindly feel free to share any queries that you might have as of now regarding the course.
05/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 73 658 6720: No queries
05/01/24, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Noted!
05/01/24, 3:50 pm - Harmehak: So which out of the two would you like to opt for, Princess?
05/01/24, 3:52 pm - +263 73 658 6720: Pharmacy
05/01/24, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Alright Princess, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
05/01/24, 3:54 pm - +263 73 658 6720: I see myself opening a pharmacy and manufacturing drugs that l will provide for the pharmacy
05/01/24, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Alright, do answer the question elaboratively and properly, Princess.

If you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?

*Kindly note that your responses are being evaluated rather closely as you have been provided with a second chance since you had a confusion regarding the course during our previous discussion.* <This message was edited>
05/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: I was hoping we could continue, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experiences of our Proud Edoofians!*
05/01/24, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 6:31 pm - +263 73 658 6720: I will be able to study pharmacy  at an affordable price as compared to the universities here in Zimbabwe. 
After 4 years l will work in Hospitals but the main aim l want to achieve is the knowledge of the active ingredients of making the drugs .
My dream is to open a well established pharmacy and Edoofa can help me by enabling me to go for university abroad at a much affordable price and with the aid of their Counselors
05/01/24, 6:50 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!

Well answered, Princess.
05/01/24, 7:03 pm - +263 73 658 6720: Thank you
06/01/24, 9:55 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 73 658 6720: Ok we can go on
06/01/24, 10:10 am - +263 77 544 5199: Ok
06/01/24, 10:12 am - Harmehak: So now as we proceed ahead with the discussion, Princess and Mrs Leorcardia.

May I know what all do you recall regarding the costs and enrollment fee from our previous discussion please?
06/01/24, 11:13 am - +263 73 658 6720: It was $350 for the application fee
06/01/24, 11:15 am - Harmehak: Very correct,

What else do you recall regarding the tuition fee?
06/01/24, 11:17 am - +263 73 658 6720: I'm not sure but was it $1000 to $2000 per year
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 11:28 am - +263 73 658 6720: Ok understood
06/01/24, 11:29 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
06/01/24, 11:31 am - +263 73 658 6720: It's good
06/01/24, 11:32 am - Harmehak: I believe you must recall the Earn While You Learn Program too!

Can you please share a summary of your understanding of the Earn While You Learn Program and what all do you recall?
06/01/24, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: I await your response!
07/01/24, 8:36 am - Harmehak: Good morning Princess,

I await your response.
08/01/24, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. 

May I know what challenges are you facing?
08/01/24, 9:39 am - +263 73 658 6720: Good morning 
So l  had gone for church choir
08/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I do understand.
08/01/24, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Kindly address the same now.
08/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 73 658 6720: I dont really recall but was it $2000
08/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Alright!
08/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
08/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

08/01/24, 11:45 am - +263 73 658 6720: Noted
08/01/24, 11:46 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 73 658 6720: Noted
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/01/24, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries, Princess?
08/01/24, 12:56 pm - +263 77 544 5199: Yes sir
08/01/24, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak please.
08/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
08/01/24, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

08/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
08/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 13th or 14th January 2024 for $200 and the  13th or 14th of February for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 13th or 14th January 2024. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 544 5199: 14th of January
08/01/24, 1:42 pm - Harmehak: Sure please,

However which option from the two would you like to opt for please?
08/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 544 5199: 14th of January
08/01/24, 1:44 pm - Harmehak: I would like to highlight that you have two options!

One is to pay $200 by 14th January.

Another one is to pay $350 by 14th January.
08/01/24, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Have you gone through the same?
