You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/01/24, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

06/01/24, 10:22 am - Harmehak: That's great, did you discuss your learnings with your parents too?
06/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 77 401 9351: Yes
06/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
06/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
3. Now that you must have understood you would need financial support, are your family members willing to support you?
06/01/24, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: I await your response, Tafadzwa.
06/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 77 401 9351: I understood that Edoofa program is there to support children who have aced their studies in good universities and also make sure that they get skilled and employable
06/01/24, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, what more did you learn?
06/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 77 401 9351: I'm sorry was out of data
06/01/24, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
06/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 401 9351: They offer a schoolarship 
You can also learn while earning
06/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 77 401 9351: Yes my parents are willing are willing to help
06/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 77 401 9351: I also understood that with edoofa the tuition fees is reduced to an affordable price per year
06/01/24, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: Received please,

What is your knowledge of the Finances involved, Tafadzwa?
06/01/24, 1:50 pm - +263 77 401 9351: For international students tution fees is up to $6000 - $8000
Per year but with Edoofa it goes down to $2000 - $3000 per year
06/01/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
06/01/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/01/24, 1:51 pm - Harmehak: What is your take on the same?
06/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 401 9351: So we will only have to pay $3000 per year
If i perform well it go down to 2000
06/01/24, 1:54 pm - +263 77 401 9351: I think it's understandable
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - Harmehak: If a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and;

Even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/01/24, 1:55 pm - +263 77 401 9351: I get it now
06/01/24, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries?
06/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 401 9351: No
06/01/24, 2:05 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted
06/01/24, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: So are your parents willing to support you with $1200-1500 a year, Tafadzwa?
08/01/24, 9:32 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?

08/01/24, 10:26 am - +263 77 401 9351: Okay
My parents have been thinking about it
I don't think they can afford
08/01/24, 10:29 am - Harmehak: I do understand.
08/01/24, 11:03 am - +263 77 401 9351: Ohk thank you
08/01/24, 11:05 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
08/01/24, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Let me then close your application in such a case. Feel free to re-apply when you are both mentally and financially ready to come to India for your higher education. However, in case you come across any of your friends or family members who would like to study abroad for their higher education, please share the following document with them and ask them to read it.
