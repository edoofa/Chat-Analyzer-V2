I want to  study aeronautical engineering because I'm interested in working with aircrafts. The feeling of being a female aeronautical engineer is incredible as it is a male dominated career. My mother is a primary school teacher. She has a diploma in education. I have a twin brother, he is at university, Nadine and Natalie are at primary school level. My parents payed my fees at primary level and at high school level the Franciscan Friars payed my fees under a best performance  bursary. My parents will support me at higher education level. It was $380
