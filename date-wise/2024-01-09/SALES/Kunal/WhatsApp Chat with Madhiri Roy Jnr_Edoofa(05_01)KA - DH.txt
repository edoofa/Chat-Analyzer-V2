06/01/24, 12:23 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
*Mr Madhiri* ,I will be taking you through all the aspects of the Edoofa Program but just before that, I would like to know you better as a parent. 

Please take a moment to share about yourself, including your occupation, highest educational qualification, your province, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education.
06/01/24, 1:38 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 9:36 am - +263 77 393 5053: Good morning
08/01/24, 9:39 am - Kunal: Good morning, Mr Madhiri
How are you doing?
08/01/24, 9:41 am - +263 77 393 5053: I'm a male adult  aged 45 . l completed my A level 1997 and worked in the private sector and government from 1998 to 2003. 1st of 2003 l left Zimbabwe to South Africa for greener pastures. In South Africa l failed to secure a job and turned into self employment. 2010 l returned to Zimbambwe and start my Hardware and Airtime business and later moved to grocery business to date. I wish my son study to University level considering is more into books  and is a God fearing person. I also personally feel education is the only investment good for kids than material things.
08/01/24, 9:45 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing about your journey and I appreciate your commitment to your son's education. Education is indeed a valuable investment in a person's future.
08/01/24, 9:46 am - Kunal: Could you shed some light on what kind of student you feel your child is, what are your child's strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe *Roy* as a person, please?

Please include these aspects so that we can guide you with the best way
1. Educational qualifications and current Education Level.
2. Career aspirations
3. Hobbies and interests
4. Family members, siblings
5. Name of O-level and A-level school
6. Term fee at school and who has been supporting the child's education so far.

You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
08/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 77 393 5053: I think Roy is an obedient and God fearing child.He is also very sociable.I think the fact that he was a prefect in primary school and currently senior prefect as an upper 6 student may confirm that he has an acceptable behavior.one of the weaknesses that  I noted in him is  disorderliness at times.One of His strength is that He loves and trusts in God so much that he desists from a lot of problematic behaviors shown by a lot of kids of his age.To support his love for God aspect,he is at times given a chance to lead and preach in main services at school,however he needs to balance this with his school work.                         In educational qualifications he got 6 units at grade 7 ,at form 4 he wrote 12 subjects including computers with hexco which he passed with a distinction.                        He is aspiring to be a mechanical engineer.               He is interested in being a pastor apart from engineering thus his hobbies are mainly on biblical research as well as other related books.       He is the 1st born and has 2 siblings.                   He did his O-level at Daramombe where he is currently  doing form 6.Term fee is currently pegged at 450us,which I'm strg
08/01/24, 10:41 am - +263 77 393 5053: ...which I'm struggling to pay on my own as I have been paying for his education from the onset.

08/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 77 393 5053: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 10:48 am - Kunal: Thank you for shairng about Roy honestly
I am glad to know more about him

May I know if you have applied for the Edoofa program earlier too?
08/01/24, 10:49 am - +263 77 393 5053: No,we have not
08/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 77 393 5053: But we are not sure if he had made some applications from school
08/01/24, 11:06 am - Kunal: Alright please
May I know about his career aspirations?
08/01/24, 11:07 am - +263 77 393 5053: He is aspiring to be a mechanical engineer
08/01/24, 11:08 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
So, may I know what fascinated him about pursuing a course and career in mechanical engineering?
08/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 77 393 5053: I'm not so sure on that one but I think that he might have been motivated by a relative and also it seems to be a rewarding career which is a fact which he stated for sure.He grew up wanting to do something related with science but not medicine so I think mechanical engineering came up as an optimum option for him.
08/01/24, 11:28 am - Kunal: That is fine
May I know about the subjects of Roy in A level?
08/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 393 5053: Mechanical Mathematics , Computer science, Physics and Pure Mathamatics
08/01/24, 11:32 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about him achieving it.
08/01/24, 11:37 am - +263 77 393 5053: Thank you very much for taking time and briefing us,we are very hopeful that he will make it.
08/01/24, 11:38 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
08/01/24, 11:39 am - Kunal: May I know with his interests in Mechanical engineering, why didn't he opt for chemistry at A level?
08/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 77 393 5053: He didn't do very well in chemistry at O-level and also that he said that it was more of a medicinal requirement which he didn't want.
08/01/24, 11:59 am - Kunal: I understand, let me tell you since he is not having chemistry at A level, he is not eligible for Mechanical engineering
At the same time, may I know if he is having any alternate career aspirations?
08/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 393 5053: He was all into mechanical engineering, but since we made an error as to the regards of the requirements of mechanical engineering may you kindly help us with an alternative career path as we will also make an effort to let him see the light of this new development.
08/01/24, 12:23 pm - Kunal: Alright, may I know if he is inclined towards any other field?
08/01/24, 12:43 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 1:45 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

08/01/24, 4:12 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 4:13 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued about your child to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on his career?
08/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 393 5053: India is greatly recognised for  offering credible education which is internationally recognised thus increasing his chances of obtaining a good career
08/01/24, 4:52 pm - Kunal: Indeed, I believe your child would learn a lot from the exposures offered if found eligible and works hard to achieve the dreams. Moving ahead, by any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
08/01/24, 4:55 pm - +263 77 393 5053: No  ,I haven't researched on that yet
08/01/24, 4:57 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/01/24, 4:58 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Thanks for the information
08/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Is the amount to be paid all at once or there is a payment plan?
08/01/24, 5:11 pm - Kunal: *This cost is paid in two equal installments.Each installment is paid before a semester.There are two semesters in a year*
08/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Yes since it is divided into 2 ,I think it is affordable
08/01/24, 5:15 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
08/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 77 393 5053: That is great news indeed,i'm not aware as to how this is done.
08/01/24, 5:21 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that are equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies and needs, converting an Individual into a market-ready professional. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/01/24, 5:21 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, such as:
*Africa Global Radio-* The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project and hear from the CEO about the exposures of the Edoofa program.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
*Skooqs-* This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*Recruitment Partners:-*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

*Webinars:-*
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars regularly with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
-Digitalization of Industries: How to Become an all-rounder in the Ever-changing Professional World by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
-How to Network like a Boss by Ms Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
-How to be industry-ready before graduating? Hear it from an Employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
-It’s Never Too Late to Pursue Your Passion: My Journey from Real Estate to Entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
-Decoding the Science of Personal Branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/01/24, 5:21 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 5:28 pm - +263 77 393 5053: I think it is very beneficial, and yes I will appreciate it most if he does enroll for the program.
08/01/24, 5:28 pm - Kunal: Indeed,
If I have to help you explain how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable compared to Local Universities, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now, if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, bringing the cost further down to $1000 per year including the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month. _This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

*You can see this even in this scholarship credit certificate where one of our star performers, our Proud Edoodians  Masinire Miriam earned $1965 within a year.* I hope you can now realize the power of the EWYL program to reduce the financial pressure on families?
08/01/24, 5:28 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Yes this is great indeed,gaining experience and reducing the burden on the parents at the same time.thanks for the enlightenment.
08/01/24, 5:32 pm - Kunal: Indeed
Great, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :

08/01/24, 5:53 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?

08/01/24, 6:08 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
08/01/24, 6:10 pm - +263 77 393 5053: It feels great,it's a great achievement for me ,kind of a dream come true even for him.
08/01/24, 6:11 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
08/01/24, 6:11 pm - Kunal: *As we move to the last part of the session, let me highlight a few requirements while a student applies alone* 

*1) Application Form* -An online or offline form that asks for your personal details and academic background.

*2) Statement of Purpose-* An essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and your aspirations for your career.

*3) Letter of Recommendation-* from Senior authorities, School Heads or others on why they recommend you to be a right fit for an international university.
Do you know about other requirements?
08/01/24, 6:20 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Probably, stating who will be responsible for paying  the fees and stating the next of kin incase of any emergency.
08/01/24, 6:21 pm - Kunal: Absolutely, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose costs between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally and act as a major parameter to decide the child’s eligibility. If you apply to 5 Universities, the average costs for the mentioned would be $1350-$1750, *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected*

*Edoofa has identified a solution for this uncertainty and unaffordability.* If a student qualifies after the eligibility check, not only does Edoofa help them draft their statement of purpose but also helps in terms of Visa Documentation Assistance, University Session and selection, Individual mentorship, etc, reducing the costs significantly to $750 which is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/01/24, 6:21 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 6:35 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
08/01/24, 6:50 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Yes,please
08/01/24, 6:51 pm - Kunal: There are 3 phases to the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Acceptance Letter. You are supposed to pay the enrollment fee of $350 in 7 days for the scholarship seat reservation and to begin the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting the Earn While You Learn program session(Each student will have an opportunity to earn scholarship credits that can be used to reduce their fee even before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A-level results are out and the student has passed the requirement as per Edoofa, then their final university evaluation and Admission will continue. However, if the student wouldn’t meet the requirements as per the university and Edoofa, then the $350 will be refunded to the parent.

The amount of credits earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the first year’s annual fee itself so that parents are relieved from financial stress paving the way for proper financial planning for higher education.
08/01/24, 6:51 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
08/01/24, 6:51 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/01/24, 7:09 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed and finish this session?
08/01/24, 7:45 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Yes
08/01/24, 7:48 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 8:07 pm - Kunal: I am expecting your response, please
08/01/24, 8:25 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
08/01/24, 8:30 pm - Kunal: This message was deleted
08/01/24, 8:38 pm - +263 77 393 5053: We have discussed up to stage 06
08/01/24, 8:39 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
08/01/24, 8:41 pm - +263 77 393 5053: Yes
08/01/24, 8:42 pm - Kunal: *Step 5:* After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/01/24, 8:42 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
08/01/24, 8:49 pm - Kunal: We have come to the end of your counselling session. Before I guide you Step 2 of the Eligibility Check, I want you to have a full-fledged discussion of the Edoofa program within your family as higher education is supposed to be a family decision.
