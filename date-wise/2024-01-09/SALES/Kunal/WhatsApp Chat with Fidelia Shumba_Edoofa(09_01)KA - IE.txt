What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship? I have learnt from jesca that Edoofa offers a partial scholarship in which it helps us in financing our selfs through EWYL program in which we will not be receiving money but grants and credits. That will only be gotten out of hard work and commitment.

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)?
Because I am a very hardworking student who has a lot of passion, dedication and commitment to my goals. And I want to fulfill my dreams through Edoofa because I was told about how great it is and I want to experience this as well.It's a passion. I'm just passionate and particular about how the human body works and making drugs to administer. I would like to introduce new things like new drugs that could help human body to function effectively.I lost my grandma to cancer and so that also triggered my passion for medicine and also interest in pharm D. I just have the determination of making new drugs for the incurable diseases

And I know Edoofa is a place for all of that.
