03/01/24, 1:17 pm - Kunal: Noted
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about her achieving it
03/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 896 4887: Yes lam confident  since she is a hardworking  somebody and lam going to support her in extra lessons for her A level inorder to achieve it .l will try my level best although  lam facing monitory challenges will support her A ll cost
03/01/24, 2:01 pm - Kunal: I understand
03/01/24, 2:01 pm - Kunal: As you know, higher education is a big decision that can create a significant impact on your child’s future

As a parent, what are your financial plans and preparations for it so that your child receives access to the best opportunities?
03/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 77 896 4887: True lam doing a project for chickens
03/01/24, 2:18 pm - Kunal: Alright please
03/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: Let me help you understand, since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
03/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: Since she is not having Physics, I regret to inform you that she is not eligible for Medicine, but considering her interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that she is eligible for and which can help fulfill her dreams of working in this field

03/01/24, 5:08 pm - Kunal: *BSc Cardiovascular Technology* is a 4-year degree program that deals with diagnosing and monitoring diseases related to the heart and the circulatory system. In this program, students will get familiar with various complex procedures such as performing stent implants, setting up cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators in the treatment of heart diseases. The BSc Cardiovascular Technology syllabus includes subjects such as Human Anatomy, Cardiovascular System, Physiology, Pathology, Electrocardiography and Echocardiography.

*BSc Cardiovascular Technology: What is it about?*
-BSc in Cardiovascular Technology deals with various topics on the vascular or the circulatory system. 
-Through this course, one gets to learn about the arteries, veins and the blood vessels that carry blood throughout the human body. These blood vessels are also instrumental in delivering oxygen and essential nutrients to the body tissues.
-With the help of this course one gets to learn about the various cardiovascular diseases that affect the human body. 
-This course also helps a cardiovascular technologist or technician to learn about the various procedures and tests while assisting the physician in diagnosing and treating a patient ailing from heart disease. 
-Some of the complex procedures that a student learns in this course are implanting of stents and setting up a pacemaker. They learn through this course, both invasive  as well as non-invasive procedures in the treatment of heart diseases.

*Why Should You Study a BSc Cardiovascular Technology course?* 
-BSc Cardiovascular Technology is a prestigious and popular stream of study in the field of allied health sciences. This field of study has a lot of importance and applications as it concerns directly with the treatment of heart diseases. Let us see here some of the reasons why one should study B.Sc Cardiovascular Technology.

-With more and more people suffering from heart diseases because of many factors including lifestyle, genetics and environment, the importance of this field of study is ever increasing.
-Cardiologists and other heart surgeons greatly depend upon the services and support of cardiovascular technologists and technicians for carrying out various complex procedures on patients suffering from heart ailments.
-With congenital heart diseases too on the rise, that is those that are prevalent in patients from birth itself, there is an increased awareness among different walks of people about the risks associated with such heart diseases. This in turn, further brings the field in limelight, as people are more likely to avail the services of a cardiovascular technologist.
