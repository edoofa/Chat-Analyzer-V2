 I learnt that edoofa program is  a program   that  offers 50 - 100% Scholarship in terms of tuition fee for students across africa so that they get quality education in India at reduced cost . I learnt that edoofa main job is  to fight the problem of affordability since quality education  is higher in current times
 


I think I should be accepted into edoofa program because l am looking forward to get quality education  but it is expensive for my parents so edoofa program can help my parents to pay fees  since  edoofa reduces fees with certain percentages
