*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/01/24, 10:39 am - +263 71 139 5810: Yes
06/01/24, 10:41 am - +27 62 983 6325: Good morning and how are you
06/01/24, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
06/01/24, 10:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know that have you gone through the document?
06/01/24, 10:47 am - +27 62 983 6325: Yes i did
06/01/24, 10:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to support Irvine financially?
06/01/24, 10:54 am - +27 62 983 6325: According to the document , it difficult for me to get that amount
06/01/24, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Emeny, I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
06/01/24, 11:04 am - +27 62 983 6325: Yes i compare it , that one for Zimbabwe is less but I'm still struggling to raise it
06/01/24, 11:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months last year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
06/01/24, 11:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child’s career, aren't you?
06/01/24, 11:11 am - +27 62 983 6325: Yes I'm looking for such opportunity
06/01/24, 11:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is it, Mr. Emeny, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is assisting you with the same, so, May I know if you are willing to continue?
06/01/24, 11:18 am - +27 62 983 6325: Yes let us continue
06/01/24, 11:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!
06/01/24, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Moving forward, please send your O level and term results with me, preferably in picture format for your academic evaluation.
06/01/24, 11:24 am - +27 62 983 6325: O'level results for Irvine ?

06/01/24, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, 
Let me brief you that, I want to brief you that the criteria before the pandemic was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is *a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/01/24, 12:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
