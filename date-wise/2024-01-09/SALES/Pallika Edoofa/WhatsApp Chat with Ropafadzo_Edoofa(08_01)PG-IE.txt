I welcome you to this session.

I am *Ms. Pallika*, and am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Austin*, our Senior Career Counsellor, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.

We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *Kudakwashe* from Zimbabwe


I would like you to come online so that I can discuss with you the Scholarship opportunities for there higher education abroad.
08/01/24, 3:16 pm - +263 71 740 0072: Thank you for considering my application
08/01/24, 3:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Ropafadzo,
How are you doing today?
08/01/24, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As per the program protocols, it's essential to have the representation of your parents/guardians or whoever is supporting your education in the group. This ensures that they can follow the sessions, comprehend the program thoroughly, and pose any questions they may have. Given that higher education is a significant decision requiring family support. If they are currently unavailable, they can still join the group and catch up on the conversations later.
*So, I am making you the group admin. I see one of your parents is already a part of the group. Please add other parent/guardians or educational supporters and let me know the names and the relations once done. Let me know if there is any challenge.*
