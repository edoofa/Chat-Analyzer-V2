From grade 3 until O level she has been 💯 under my care and did very well in her O’level .
On my side she is the only child , however she has 2 other half siblings from her father who only ncane into her life after she completed O’level after doing all the work on my own from a very young age .

O’level school - Usher high school
A’level school - Msitheli high school
