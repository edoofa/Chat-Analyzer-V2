*“Education is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire.”– W.B. Yeats*
With my experience, I have come across many students who have a dream of studying abroad but fail to find a reliable source. They often fall for brokers/agents with no distant aim for future career. It may also be possible that you would have come across any University publicizing for Admissions from the UK, Australia, Poland, or even India. We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad. 

I hereby request you to go through this detailed article to compare your previous experiences if you had one. You can feel free to share the Name of the University you applied to or the Name of the Organization that offered you admission at any of the Universities. Let me know as soon as you have gone through and I will be guiding you through your program details.
