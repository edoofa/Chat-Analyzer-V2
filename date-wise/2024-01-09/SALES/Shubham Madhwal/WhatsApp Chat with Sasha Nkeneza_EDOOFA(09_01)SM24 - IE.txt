We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student *Tadiwanashe* <This message was edited>
08/01/24, 4:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, I have managed to reserve a time slot *tomorrow morning at 10 AM CAT*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counselling session so that we can process your application
08/01/24, 4:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Since you *have gotten to know about the scholarship program from Kelvin, please reach out to your friend* to understand their complete journey and views on the program to attain greater clarity and understanding about the program. In the meantime, can you also please share your answers to the preliminary 6 questions that your friend might have asked you while sharing the application form with you. So that we can verify your application?
