08/01/24, 10:20 am - Shubham Madhwal: Great so Cassandra, After understanding your interests and motivation 
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts in Psychology*
08/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 899 9749: *_-Certainly_*
08/01/24, 10:44 am - Shubham Madhwal: *Bachelor in Psychology* is a 3-year undergraduate course.

*What is a Bachelor in Psychology course?*

In Bachelor in Psychology, students learn mainly about the processing of the human mind and human behaviour. They study how humans behave differently in different circumstances while dealing with different sets of people. On the basis of this, various conclusions are drawn.

 *What is it about?*

Psychology, in simple terms, is the study of human mind and human behavior. A student of psychology has to study how a human mind works in different situations, how it develops perception, what are the various circumstances and how they affect the development of human behavior. Although psychology is introduced at school level in India, it is only at the college level when one learns the basic theories and applications related to Psychology and Psychoanalysis. Psychology courses at the undergraduate level are generally application based and prepare students for entry level jobs in related fields.

BA Psychology is ideal for students who have a leaning towards Arts and Social Sciences and are willing to take up an in-depth study of psychology.

*Career Prospects*

What can you do with a BA degree in Psychology?

The graduates of BA Psychology have a lot of opportunities ahead, both in academics and in the job sector.

*Jobs*

The graduates of this course get various opportunities to work in many different fields in both the private sector and the government sector. They get work in departments like hospitals, educational institutes, corporate organizations, etc. Some of the profiles which are open for them are Social Worker, Sales Representative, Recruiters, Teachers, etc.
08/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 78 899 9749: *_-That's intriguing_*
08/01/24, 10:54 am - Shubham Madhwal: So does this course align with your career aspirations?
08/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 78 899 9749: Very Much so.
08/01/24, 11:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: That's amazing, can you tell me If you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams? *Answer in Detail*
08/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 78 899 9749: *_-Achieving a BA in Psychology is a great accomplishment and I would want to use the skills I gained to pursue a career in mental health counseling or starting a private practice maybe or even teaching at University level. Also it would be pleasing to me to further my education and obtain a masters or PhD in psychology. So getting into Edoofa's program would be an honor that would give me validation and encouragement that I have potential and of cause it will open opportunities that might not have been available to me otherwise,such as networking and internships_*
08/01/24, 12:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time,

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career?
08/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 78 899 9749: Most certainly.
08/01/24, 12:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
08/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 78 899 9749: *_-I'm more than confident. I'm doing 3 A level subjects and I'm confident I'll achieve that_*
08/01/24, 12:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons why Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education destination?
08/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 899 9749: Yes I've been meaning to inquire about that
08/01/24, 1:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future.
08/01/24, 1:34 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
08/01/24, 2:07 pm - +263 78 899 9749: The opportunity to experience a new culture and learn about the world from a different perspective. Studying abroad also allows students to improve their language skills, gain independence, and broaden their horizons.
08/01/24, 2:19 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/01/24, 8:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
08/01/24, 8:26 pm - +263 78 899 9749: I did  research on the cost of the program and whether financial aid is available. Also  researched on the location and culture of the host country, including the climate, safety, and language. Went through some Edoofa videos and pdfs including the courses offered, the quality of the instruction, and the academic reputation of the program. Just had difficulties with living arrangements, including housing, food, and transportation.
