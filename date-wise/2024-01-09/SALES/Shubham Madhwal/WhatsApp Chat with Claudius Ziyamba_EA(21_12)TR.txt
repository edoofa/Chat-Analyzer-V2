23/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 622 8473: Hello my name is Claudius Ziyamba a young man aged 18 last born of four children ,currently studying Pure Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics at Mt Selinda High School in Manicaland Province with my final high school year (Upper 6) being in 2024. 

After completing my studies hopefully wth flying colours i would like to pursue a degree in Aeronautical Engineering as i have always been fascinated by the science behind aeronautics.

I would say My weakness is not achieving a goal i set for myself and my strength is socialisation as i can interact exceptionally well with people around me .

Mother : nurse : diploma in general nursing and midwifery
Father : teacher : diploma in teaching 

My mother currently pays for my school fees which is USD 385 but really stuggles to pay for it due to the current economic challenges in the country and also has to pay for my other siblings' university fees 

My first born sister is doing her final year in chemical engineering. 

My second born sister is doin her third year in a S.H.E degree .

My third born brother is doing his attchment for his Accounting degree. 

My mother and my sister will be supporting me for my education abroad given that she gets a job by the time i start my higher education.

 
I like reading novels and i do public speaking and debate at school
23/12/23, 10:18 am - Tushti: I hope the mother and sister both are added to this group?

27/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 622 8473: Wow .....quite excellent
27/12/23, 11:38 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
27/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 77 622 8473: Yes i have researched about costs at  CTU
27/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 622 8473: As well as charndigarh university
27/12/23, 11:41 am - Tushti: Can you tell me what the costs are, according to your knowledge?
27/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 622 8473: For the degrees i had in mind they where in 3500 to 4500 ranges
27/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: Very well
27/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
27/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
27/12/23, 11:55 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: In simple words Claudius, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 622 8473: Quite impressive indeed ...my friend told me about that aspect (EWYLP) and its also one of the reasons why i applied for this programme as it really is a game changer
27/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: That's right
27/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/12/23, 12:06 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*
27/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 622 8473: Wow she must have really worked really hard for such an amazing credit
27/12/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: Indeed
27/12/23, 12:13 pm - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that *you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.*

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 77 622 8473: Yes
27/12/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: Claudius as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 622 8473: $1500 - 2250
27/12/23, 12:50 pm - Tushti: Exactly Claudious, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/12/23, 12:51 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 1:14 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
27/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 704 0782: Yes
27/12/23, 2:12 pm - Tushti: Please answer
27/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 704 0782: I agree as i have seen that it reduces costs hence facilitating affordability fot the student and their family
27/12/23, 2:17 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/12/23, 2:17 pm - Tushti: So, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
27/12/23, 2:17 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
27/12/23, 2:17 pm - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
27/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 704 0782: Yes I understand
27/12/23, 2:19 pm - Tushti: Does your parent understand?
27/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 704 0782: Yes she does
27/12/23, 2:20 pm - Tushti: I would like her to answer
27/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 704 0782: Yes i do
27/12/23, 2:30 pm - Tushti: Can the parent answer using a voice note?
27/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 622 8473: Yes that would be quiet helpful indeed
27/12/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
27/12/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
27/12/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
27/12/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.
27/12/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
27/12/23, 2:45 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
27/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 704 0782: No
27/12/23, 2:57 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/12/23, 2:57 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
27/12/23, 2:58 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

7.

Are you clear about the same?
28/12/23, 4:26 pm - Tushti: The questions must be answered by the parent, not the student
28/12/23, 4:49 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>

5.$350 .....$200 to be paid in 7days and the rest ($150) to be paid in the next 30 days

6. I understand that the Earn While You Learn Program is a program in which the student will get live online projects during which they aquire work experience in which they will be awarded with scholarship credits which will be  directly proportional to the amount of performance of the student. The scholarship credits will be in form of cash which can be used to pay off a significant part of the students' fees hence reducing the university education costs.What i greatly understood about the program is that it keeps the student up to date with the transformations within a particular sector they will be studying in turn making them quite eligible to tackle every endeavour that they may face in their area 


7. Yes i understand that
29/12/23, 9:35 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

In case you do not follow these terms then your child's entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
29/12/23, 10:18 am - Tushti: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *6th January 2024* for $200 and the  *6th February 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *6th January 2024*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE

My Inspirational Story

Ever since the day I escaped from my mother's womb on the 18th of the Hot September month the only thing i remember till this day is my passion for everything aero.As i grew older , my mother always told me that i would sour through the skies as a pilot and would brag about it to her colleagues each time i excelled at the end of each school term.As years went by my passion for the sector also grew with age.When uncle who was a pilot passed in a plane crash i researched through various news platforms see what had caused the tragedy but to no avail .Since that day i made a promise to myself that i would make it my life mission to make sure that crashes would never take anyones loved one again. I then studied extra hard to make my dream a possibility and will make sure that nothing, no endeavor will stop me from reaching where i want to go

I am Mr Shubham, Senior Academician at Edoofa

02/01/24, 2:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please I hope you have been following the session so far.

So are there any questions that you or your family would like to ask regarding the program details?

02/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 704 0782: Yes

02/01/24, 4:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
02/01/24, 5:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 9:21 am - Shubham Madhwal: Good Morning Claudius and Mrs Ziyamba @263777040782 @263776228473, How are you?
03/01/24, 9:51 am - +263 77 704 0782: We are okay
03/01/24, 10:42 am - Shubham Madhwal: So before proceeding with the session, are there any questions you would like to ask?
03/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 77 622 8473: No
03/01/24, 11:12 am - Shubham Madhwal: I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
03/01/24, 11:12 am - +263 77 704 0782: Yes i am aware
03/01/24, 11:23 am - Shubham Madhwal: So *Mrs Ziyamba @263776228473*, before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that *Claudius* would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
03/01/24, 11:29 am - +263 77 622 8473: 1.Aeronautical Engineering

2.India

3.$6000-$8000

4.$4000

5.$350 .....$200 to be paid in 7days and the rest ($150) to be paid in the next 30 days

6. I understand that the Earn While You Learn Program is a program in which the student will get live online projects during which they aquire work experience in which they will be awarded with scholarship credits which will be  directly proportional to the amount of performance of the student. The scholarship credits will be in form of cash which can be used to pay off a significant part of the students' fees hence reducing the university education costs.What i greatly understood about the program is that it keeps the student up to date with the transformations within a particular sector they will be studying in turn making them quite eligible to tackle every endeavour that they may face in their area 


7. Yes i understand that
03/01/24, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263776228473*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
03/01/24, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *@263776228473* Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Claudius* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.  

In case you do not follow these terms then *Claudius's* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
03/01/24, 12:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the *10th or 11th of January 2024* for $200 and the *09th or 10th of February 2024* for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the *10th or 11th of January 2024*

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
03/01/24, 12:08 pm - +263 77 704 0782: 1
03/01/24, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please ask your parents to answer the same
