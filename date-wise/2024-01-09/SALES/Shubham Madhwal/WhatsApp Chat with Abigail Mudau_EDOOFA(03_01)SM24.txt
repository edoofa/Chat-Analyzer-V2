04/01/24, 11:05 am - +263 77 121 0321: OK what i understand about Edoofa scholarship is that it helps our kids to go abroad and do their studies without any costs like it helps kids to fulfill their dreams even to us parents it we appreciate it coz we don't pay anything
04/01/24, 12:13 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
04/01/24, 12:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
04/01/24, 2:19 pm - +263 77 121 0321: Woooow that's good news thank you so much for the updates 🙏
04/01/24, 3:22 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ms Eunice

As for me I was only be able to get to high school and currently lm self employed doing buying and selling. For my kid to study abroad this will open a lot of opportunities in her life as the education is the only key to achieving and thus she will network and learn more from other people from different backgrounds and cultural backgrounds an countries.
