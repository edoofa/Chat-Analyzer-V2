19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program myself.
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
19/12/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes it is.
19/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 574 5393: This idea is exactly the one l am looking for.
19/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Employability skills is a scarce commodity in most of us(students) so may you kindly shed more light on that point. l need to understand.
19/12/23, 12:37 pm - Gurvinder: Please be patient, let us continue the counselling session, your every concern related to this will be addressed ahead.
19/12/23, 12:38 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Craig, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes indeed sir.
19/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now Craig, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

23/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?

23/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

23/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Wow, sir it sounds like India will actually change the future of the world through its big success. Looking at CEOs Indians are the ones ruling big  companies. I look forward to seeing  India succeed. If l get a chance to get a scholarship in India l would be very happy because l have heard that your country has a larger majority of 
english speakers and can improve my tongue. Sir those pictures have touched me, l hope my country will copy from your country and also become self sufficient in future.
23/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: So now Craig, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
23/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok sir l wanted to ask that do you do your studies in English only or you do mix with your native language.
23/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Thank you for sharing these links, have a Merry Christmas filled with joy. We will meet on Tuesday.
26/12/23, 8:35 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
26/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 574 5393: How are you sir.
26/12/23, 9:48 am - Gurvinder: Please, the medium of Education in India is English only.
26/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 574 5393: Ok sir l also wanted to ask that suppose l am on  Edoofa scholarship do l seek my attachment or or you do provide.
26/12/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: Please, let us be patient and move ahead with the counselling session, as all your concerns will addressed ahead automatically.
26/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 574 5393: Noted, thank you for notifying me.
26/12/23, 11:25 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
26/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 574 5393: Actually some of my family members know a little bit.
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 12:02 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok so this means that  students can pay the remaining tuition fee through the Earn While You Learn even in their first year at the University.
26/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
26/12/23, 1:06 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
26/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes sir please do explain.
26/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Craig, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Alright thank you for shading more light on the program.
26/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
26/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
26/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

SHARE SEMINAR POSTERS THEN THE BELOW MESSAGE

These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
26/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 574 5393: In my on point of view, it benefits at a greater extent because students can have knowledge on aspects like advertisements, technology, and lastly they can learn through experience.
26/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Craig, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
26/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes l am sir
26/12/23, 3:11 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 3:12 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

26/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok l have seen that this program plays a pivotal role in promoting students and also gaining excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits. It also helps students to learn and develop 21st Century job skill like research, content writing,  SEO, Digital marketing, creative content creation.
26/12/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Craig, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
26/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok sir the main reason l have applied for this scholarship is that most of my family member are poor, my wish is to get assistance from you.
26/12/23, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: By bringing down your fees from $6000-$8000, are we not giving assistance?
26/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Pardon me sir l did not understand properly.
26/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: Craig, we have brought down the your fees down to $2000-$3000, the EWYL program helps you reduce the cost down more, but for rest of the cost, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for that?
26/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok so how much must my family members pay
26/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I have given you the range of the cost of education after the scholarship, how much you are able to reduce it depends on you.
26/12/23, 3:47 pm - Gurvinder added +263 77 120 6156
26/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Alright l have understood  that it is payed after the scholarship.
26/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 120 6156: How Mr Gurvinder. l'm Craig's brother. Thank you for adding me
26/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 120 6156: How are you Mr Gurvinder. I'm Craig 's brother. Thank you for adding me
26/12/23, 4:00 pm - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you.
26/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
26/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok l will be proactive as you have said.
26/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 120 6156: Okay sir will be proactive
26/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: Craig as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
26/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Suppose student A applies in 5 universities he/she pays about a sum of $1500-$2250 in all.
26/12/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Craig, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
26/12/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok so in January the price will be $750.
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
26/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
26/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok it is well but currently on my side things are still tight and l don't have the amount right now.
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: Craig basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
26/12/23, 4:31 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
26/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok thank you for notifying.
26/12/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 574 5393: No sir l am not.
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Craig, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
26/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Now l have understood the cycle far much better thank you.
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
26/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.

28/12/23, 9:59 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 574 5393: I am fine sir. How are you.
28/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 120 6156: I am well sir, l hope you're as well.
28/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, I understand your problem, but education and general living is expensive in Zimbabwe too
28/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: In our quest to provide an education that is affordable, accessible and employable, our Founders have been to African Nations multiple times. Recently during their stay in Zimbabwe in June 2023, they gained valuable insights. Inflation has been a real challenge for Zimbabwean families from the last 20 years.

Until a few years ago, cost of tertiary education in Zimbabwe was affordable for majority of families, however with the recent collapse of the Zimbabwean Dollar, a lot of parents shared their experiences, emphasized the financial challenges of pursuing higher education. In today’s time *Tertiary education expenses in Zimbabwe can amount to approximately $2500-$3500 annually. This surely varies from course to course.*
28/12/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: While the cost of education rose by 25% and is within the range of $1200-$1500 per year, the cost of living is notably high. *Even a basic meal of Sadza and curry can cost a student $1 per serving. This means around $1100 is allocated solely for food, with additional essential costs such as internet which costs around $25-$35 a month, accommodation, and transportation pushing the total to $2000-$2500 per year.
28/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok l have seen. Sorry for my late response we are under bad weather here in Zimbabwe.
28/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, please acknowledge this.
28/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Standards of living in Zimbabwe are very low due to political instability and economic sanctions causing a deterioration to our monetary policies and fiscal policies.
28/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: So don't you think that studying in India is a far better choice rather than in Zimbabwe, isn't it?
28/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Education plays a pivotal role to the economy. In most less developed countries like Zimbabwe. The annual inflation rate is 943% currently. So this shows that the Zimbabwean dollar is depreciating as compared to the US dollar. Moreso this is causing poor standards of living in Zimbabwe. Thats why many parents are failing to tuition fees. Furthermore, this is why many educated and even less educated people are failing to pursue higher education. Conclusively this is leading to high crime rate and drug abuse in Zimbabwe due to poor standards of living, unemployment and high rate of inflation.
28/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes it is. Being educated in developed countries (India) is far much better because the inflation rate, exchange rates, employment rates, balance of payment, GDP, GNP and lastly  economic growth are favourable.
28/12/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: So knowing all this, don't you think that you should try to arrange those finances for the enrollment fee, that will help you start the EWYL program in January, and when you will join the University in August, assuming you earn $100 from the EWYL program, you will already have $600-700 for the University fees, thus less financial burden on your family.
28/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Yes l think its a good idea. It is my wish to be put of your Edoofa family but due to financial crisis l and my family is facing currently its not easy to find the whole sum of the enrollment fee at the particular moment.
28/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: May I know, till when can you manage to arrange the finances?
28/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Maybe in February.
28/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Please, if you try for January, then only I can take your case to the academic board to find a solution for you.
28/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok you would have helped me l will try.
28/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Please ask your brother to answer in voice note that when can he manage to collect the finances of your enrollment.
28/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 574 5393: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 574 5393: Ok sir l hope my brother will be assisting me. Sir l also want to explain something about my family. We have no unity in our family due to some previous disputes between my father and his family (they wanted a share of his property). When my father succumbed to tuberculosis in the year 2013 they pledged that they will never assist anyone in our family both our education and our basic needs. When my elder brother finished his A level he tried to ask for help but the replies were touching. From the day he finished hisg studies in 2016 until now he has never advanced to university. So thats that's why l did not respond well when you were  talking about my family members. So my hope is that if l qualify in the program l will carry the burden of assist my brother as he is following my step. So all this previous years l have been getting assistance from BEAM (Basic Education Assistance Module) in the last years, but sometimes the scholarship expired and we had to pay. The reason my brother is pushing the payment date to the 31st day of January is because my younger brother is starting his A level in January as well so the enrollment is in mid January.
29/12/23, 8:22 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
29/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 574 5393: Morning. How are you sir
29/12/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: I understand your problem, *@263775745393 @263771206156* as you know due to the acting policies and standards of the Academic Board the Board is not viable to change the 7-day deadline period. However, after careful consideration, they might be willing to consider your situation and provide, you with a part fee payment plan of $100. Which will have to be completed within the next 7 days to secure your child's seat. You can then pay 2nd $100 to complete the enrollment formalities by the 31st Of January.

That's the maximum I can do for you after looking at your situation right, I hope this will be helpful?
29/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 77 574 5393: Alright my mother has said she will try doing as you have said.
29/12/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Noted.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

WHAT IS LIFE IN RWANDA LIKE 16  YEARS AFTER THE,, GENOCIDE THERE?
Genocide has brought calamities in the the Eastern Regions of Africa and even broken the trust between tribes inhabiting the Congo region and Uganda. During the time the genocide was taking place in Rwanda kany people especially the Tutsi, Twas and half Hutus were faced many consequences that  even developed long term  problems.

Thousands of children being left homeless and orphaned as their parents were devoting their lives in order to secure their victory in the dispute, they did not wish for their tribes to be dismantled. The Tutsi were living in despair and had sick refuge in DRC under there leader Mr Paul Kagame. Their massive migration is the biggest one ever expected. Fear was ever as the Hutu power seeker under Akayesu were indisputable.

When the genocide ceased in 1994, calamities became lower as the war hard calmed. Rwandans had unity at last.  At this particular moment most of the Rwandans can now afford to find enough food to feed themselves freely. The nation is now united under President Kagame's delegation and no more genocide is even to be expected. Although Rwandans tried to cause war in Goma in DRC with the aid of Uganda peace is still available in the Republic.

Most of the survivors have played a pivotal role in developing the country. Since the year 1995 the growth rate has even raised by 7-8% annually and civilians now enjoy a better maternal health. Moreso their infant mortality rate has plummeted. Residents now experience a low corruption rate their life is of high quality. They are working hard in order to produce innovative ideas filled with research and exploration.

This makes Rwanda one of the world's fast growing economy both economically and politically. In the previous years its economy has became stable with a steady economic growth rate. Although the COVID19 pandemic tried to threaten the economy through impacts and lockdowns but but economic stability is still available. The government has tried by all means to maintain  peace by placing warriors at vulnerable boarders to prevent invading ethnic groups. They do not want the ideas official Akayesu from destructing Rwanda again.

SECTION 6: My Inspirational  thoughts
My hopes are always scattered in my mind, they sound like dreams l expect to come true one of the days. By any mere chance l hope to transform  other people's lives through change.

I hope that one day l will transform daily lives through technology. In my commmunity technology is a scarce commodity and many people think it is bad to interact, with technology. Education and technology are far from good  in my community. Most students are not embarked with the merits of technology but are filled with its demerits.

My hope is that one day l will plant the knowledge in most of my community, training most of the youngsters to access modern technology. I can sense that the absense of technology in my regional education sector and caused a downfall in passrate as more students are not getting enough knowledge. My hope are that when l am accompanied by my degree l will play a pivotal role in creation of a platform  of education assistance.  I hope that parents will no longer be burdened by children. Children will be getting assistance from the platform throughout the homework in every subject.

In the modern day world, education is the only way thats leads an individual to a standard daily living. I hope that my platform will update children with current up to date syllabi of my region helping them summaries their knowledge and lastly, boost their passrates.
