04/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Tapiwanashe.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
04/01/24, 5:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
05/01/24, 6:34 am - +263 78 861 2112: I am willing to give it maximum effort and all the hard work it demands maam
05/01/24, 9:42 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263788612112 @263779314145 , Hope you are doing well.
05/01/24, 9:42 am - Garima Edoofa: As discussed yesterday I am here to continue with your counseling session, shall we start?
05/01/24, 9:42 am - Garima Edoofa: I am glad to know that.
05/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 78 861 2112: Yes ma'am
05/01/24, 11:22 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, please, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/01/24, 3:41 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Okay maam 

As you know Zimbabwe is a developing economy operating under economic sanctions at the same time suffering high rates of unemployment and inflation respectively.

Studying abroad would give me an opportunity to tackle the effects of unemployment faced in my home country and I would get a chance to be employed elsewhere. 

Also studying abroad delights me an opportunity to interact with people from various parts of the world and would get to learn foreign language as well as cultures of other countries.
05/01/24, 3:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/01/24, 4:04 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Okay..

I want to make use of the differences between the 2 educational systems.. (the Indian and the Zimbabwean educational systems) to come up with an improvement of the educational system in my home country. 

I.e copy and improve(if possible) 

Therefore, seeing and learning how other countries operate would   enable me to implement the plan
05/01/24, 4:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Tapiwanashe, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Yes I do Ms Garima..
05/01/24, 4:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: I admire your willingness to put in the effort necessary to advance your career. 
I trust you will conduct further research into the course.

05/01/24, 4:12 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Indeed
05/01/24, 4:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, now that you have a clear picture of your career and an understanding of the program, do you know which countries Edoofa suggests for higher education?
05/01/24, 4:14 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Yes maam
05/01/24, 4:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: Could you please help me with the name of the country that Edoofa suggests for higher education?

05/01/24, 4:28 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Yes I have maam
05/01/24, 4:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Tapiwanahe, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
05/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 78 861 2112: 1. India being a country recognized by rich and influential personalities like Bill Gates and Steve Daines to mention but a few... I see it assisting me to to obtain employment opportunities across the globe and in highly prominent companies In the world

2 The engine towards any ambition is hard work ...so through a high degree of commitment and perseverance I see myself as a total achiever as a result of not only studying in India but also getting to pass with flying colors in India
05/01/24, 4:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tapiwanashe. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
05/01/24, 4:58 pm - +263 78 861 2112: None of us is aware aware Ms Garima
05/01/24, 4:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/01/24, 4:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 5:04 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Yes ma'am I feel that my family can afford it even though it means a little sacrifice
05/01/24, 5:12 pm - +263 78 861 2112: They will definitely afford it
05/01/24, 5:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Tapiwanashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
05/01/24, 5:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate that, please.
05/01/24, 5:18 pm - +263 78 861 2112: I think I have an idea of what the EWYL program could be about ...shall I brief you of what I know before you further explain ma'am?
05/01/24, 5:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please Tapiwanashe.
05/01/24, 5:22 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Ok ..so 

Basically I just understand the EWYL program as a system employed by Edoofa which aids the student in getting partly employed to as to pay for University and living expenses in India with little to no help from parents
05/01/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, exactly, Let me help you have a better understanding of the same.
05/01/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/01/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/01/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
05/01/24, 5:34 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Indeed ma'am I think it would be beneficial to the highest of extents as it would not only reduce the university costs but also make me a creative and a noble employable personality
05/01/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/01/24, 5:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

05/01/24, 5:57 pm - +263 78 861 2112: I have understood it clearly ma'am and I am delighted by how Edoofians are different from other students and graduates ..

I have also been fortified by the proud Edoofians you have share with me who have been awarded descent amounts of scholarship credits to yearn for such an opportunity
05/01/24, 6:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Tapiwanashe, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
05/01/24, 6:16 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Yes maam
05/01/24, 6:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tapiwanashe as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
05/01/24, 6:33 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Around..1500-2250USD
05/01/24, 6:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
05/01/24, 6:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 6:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
05/01/24, 6:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
05/01/24, 6:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey to higher education.

Don’t you think so?
05/01/24, 6:38 pm - +263 78 861 2112: I feel so Ms Garima
05/01/24, 6:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
05/01/24, 6:41 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Ok maam
05/01/24, 6:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tapiwanashe Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
05/01/24, 6:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/01/24, 6:49 pm - +263 78 861 2112: I understand Ms Garima
05/01/24, 6:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tapiwanashe, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
05/01/24, 7:26 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Ok 

The application process is around 1500-2250USD so Edoofa, In a bid to make it affordable for the student it charges the student $350 for inclusion In the program and it will assist the student in Applications to universites and EWYL
05/01/24, 7:29 pm - +263 78 861 2112: Due to COVID-19 Edoofa has reduced this amount from 750 to 350 USD and If the students parents can not afford the sum they. Can pay 200USD for the first 7 days and then 150 in the next 30 days
05/01/24, 10:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
05/01/24, 10:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 9:12 am - +263 78 861 2112: Ok Ms Garima

We have discussed the personalized counselling session and Eligibility check test & interview so far
06/01/24, 10:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
06/01/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: I hope you have understood till step 5 properly?
06/01/24, 5:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was looking forward to hearing back from you, but unfortunately, I didn't receive a response. Lately, our conversations have been a bit disrupted due to the timing not aligning with our available hours. I remain hopeful that we can have a smoother conversation on monday at 10:00 a.m., CAT.
