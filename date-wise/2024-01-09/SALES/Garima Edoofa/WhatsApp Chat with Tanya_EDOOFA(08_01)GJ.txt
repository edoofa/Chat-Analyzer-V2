08/01/24, 7:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
