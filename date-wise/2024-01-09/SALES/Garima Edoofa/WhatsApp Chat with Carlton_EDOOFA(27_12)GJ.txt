*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.
*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

05/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Ohk i understood
05/01/24, 4:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Carlton, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
05/01/24, 4:39 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Ohk 
1) Studying in India has a positive impact on my career as India offers quality education and research which can give me the highest amount of knowledge on the law course which I have chosen , not only that but as I have understood that degrees from Indian Institutions are globally recognized which means they can open doors to a wide range of career opportunities
05/01/24, 4:43 pm - +263 73 789 0885: 2)  i hope to be placed in a proper learning environment with limited disturbances , allowing me to focus on my school work
05/01/24, 5:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Carlton. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the student is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.
05/01/24, 5:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
06/01/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263737890885 @263773058541 , Hope you are doing well.
06/01/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with your counseling session, shall we start?
06/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 73 789 0885: I am doing well thank you
06/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 73 789 0885: Yes we can start
06/01/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay, so Carlton are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
06/01/24, 11:24 am - +263 73 789 0885: No , we are not aware
06/01/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.

Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/01/24, 11:40 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/01/24, 11:42 am - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think is this affordable for your family?
06/01/24, 1:11 pm - +263 73 789 0885: No , I don't think its affordable for my family
06/01/24, 1:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Carlton what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
06/01/24, 1:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know why? what are the challenges they are facing?
06/01/24, 1:51 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand Carlton. I had a discussion with the academic board, However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive Highest Quantum scholarship. With the Highest Quantum Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc! And keeping that in mind we have limited number of slots left for Highest Quantum scholarship, so would want you to discuss the same with you parents so that I can get your application approve from the higher board.
06/01/24, 2:02 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Yes please  brief me about the earn while you learn program
06/01/24, 2:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
06/01/24, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/01/24, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/01/24, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

06/01/24, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 2:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
06/01/24, 2:05 pm - +263 73 789 0885: I am afraid my family's wages cannot match the university expenses mentioned
06/01/24, 2:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Carlton through EWYL you can self-cater your education and that will reduce the burden on your family
06/01/24, 2:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Through the EWYL program so many students have earn scholarship credit.
06/01/24, 2:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/01/24, 2:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: @263737890885 I would like you to go through this video and learn how students are self-catering there education.
06/01/24, 2:17 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Ohk
06/01/24, 2:18 pm - +263 73 789 0885: May I please  know if the expenses must be paid in full
06/01/24, 2:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on that what do you exactly mean?
06/01/24, 2:21 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Are the university expenses required in one payment or in instalments
06/01/24, 2:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Carlton, University expenses can be paid in instalments, please.
06/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Ok i understand
06/01/24, 3:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
06/01/24, 3:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
06/01/24, 3:58 pm - +263 73 789 0885: I appreciate the first point , affordability through guaranteed scholarships
06/01/24, 4:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Carlton, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/01/24, 4:10 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Yes they will be
06/01/24, 4:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Carlton, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
06/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Yes I'm ready
06/01/24, 4:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Carlton as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/01/24, 4:41 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Not less than $1500
06/01/24, 4:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
06/01/24, 4:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
06/01/24, 4:46 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Yes , I think that the amount mentioned above ($350) is very affordable for someone in the same financial situation as me , therefore i believe that edoofa is really helping people out there
06/01/24, 4:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/01/24, 4:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Carlton basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
06/01/24, 4:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/01/24, 4:52 pm - +263 73 789 0885: I understand
06/01/24, 4:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Carlton, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
06/01/24, 5:16 pm - +263 73 789 0885: I understood that the program offers a 3 phrase enrollment process , phase 1 is the counseling session with the student /parents and seat reservation and if the student qualifies for the program they receive their reservation letter and has to pay a part of the program fee which is $350 within 7 days . phase 2 once the student complete his/her phase he begins his/her Earn while you learn program classes where they earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee whilst waiting for their A level results. Phase 3 , is the continuation of the admission once the final A level results are out, however if the results don't match the program's and the university's requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents .Edoofa helps a students arrange and pay his finances all by himself by providing the earn while you learn program whereby the credits earned by the student during phase 2 will be used for the student's first year annual fee
06/01/24, 5:18 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
06/01/24, 5:23 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Ok
06/01/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/01/24, 5:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/01/24, 5:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
06/01/24, 5:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/01/24, 5:32 pm - +263 73 789 0885: Yes I understand
06/01/24, 5:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that 
particular University chosen by you.
06/01/24, 5:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Basically, this registration fee of ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments*. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).

06/01/24, 5:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

06/01/24, 5:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/01/24, 5:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: And for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have.
