05/01/24, 12:15 pm - +263 77 715 6653: I am    a girl who is more focused  on my education  and l do like  education  alot .  I have completed  my advanced  level last year in November . On my ordinary  l passed  with 5  subjects and l went to  do my Advanced  level at St Matthias  Tsonzo  High  school which is along Nyanga road near St David's  Bonda Girls High. I would like to do a course  of real estate  or logistics  or economists and climatologists.  My fee l  used to pay for each term was $450 USD.   I wish to study economics.   My strengths is to socialize  with people and listen to music and when l look at  my goal  it gives me a great percentage  of my strenght . My weaknesses  is when l think of my mother  and my grandmother  who passed away some  years back . My favorite  hobby  is soccer
05/01/24, 1:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself. 
So, could you kindly tell me who in your family financially supports your education abroad, and what profession they are in?
05/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 715 6653: My aunt . She is now a retired    . She was a doctor
05/01/24, 2:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: Will she help you for your education abroad ?
05/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 715 6653: Yes if l talk to her   . I will talk to her  when she is back
05/01/24, 2:15 pm - +263 77 715 6653: If the fees are not  thats high she will agree

05/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 715 6653: No but firstly l will talk to her she doesn't  like to be added  in groups
05/01/24, 2:52 pm - +263 77 715 6653: Can l ask you something  do  you offer  full scholarships
05/01/24, 2:55 pm - Garima Edoofa: Beaullah, May I know what exactly you mean by a full scholarship?
05/01/24, 3:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since higher education plays an important role and during your counseling session we would be discussing the cost in depth and since you mentioned your aunt will be sponsoring your higher education I would suggest you add her to the group so that she is clear about the cost for higher education, please.
05/01/24, 3:59 pm - +263 77 715 6653: Oops sorry  l didn't  mean it
05/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 77 715 6653: You can just give me the details  of the cost  so that l can show  her
05/01/24, 4:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: For me to align with your thoughts what exactly do you mean by a fully funded scholarship?
05/01/24, 4:36 pm - +263 77 715 6653: Where one is just  given the opportunity  to attend  school without  payment   as an offer
05/01/24, 4:41 pm - +263 77 715 6653: That will be a fully  funded  scholarship
05/01/24, 4:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
05/01/24, 5:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
06/01/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Moring @263777156653 @263777716945 , Hope you are doing well.
06/01/24, 10:08 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to continue with your counseling session, shall we start?
06/01/24, 11:25 am - +263 77 715 6653: Yes we can start
06/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through this message?
06/01/24, 3:04 pm - +263 77 715 6653: Yes l did  and now l understand
06/01/24, 3:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know what according to your understanding Edoofa is from the above two options?
06/01/24, 3:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *Monday again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
