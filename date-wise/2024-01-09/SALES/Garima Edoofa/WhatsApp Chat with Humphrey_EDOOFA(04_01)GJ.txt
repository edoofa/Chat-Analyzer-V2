08/01/24, 3:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time, Humphrey.

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

So are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
08/01/24, 4:00 pm - +263 71 390 9736: Very much ,,l will put required efforts to earn good grades, that l promise
08/01/24, 4:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 71 390 9736: My country does not base with commercials but arts so the opportunities are very much limited
08/01/24, 4:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/01/24, 4:32 pm - +263 71 390 9736: Those will be big dreams but ...if possible l would start my own instructions like CAA  in my country so that l would encourage students to do commercials for better development of my country, however l will be giving high thanks to edoofa for the way long
08/01/24, 4:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hardwork for your community Humphrey, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
08/01/24, 5:30 pm - +263 71 390 9736: Yes l agree with you totally
08/01/24, 5:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
08/01/24, 5:54 pm - +263 71 390 9736: Yae India is known of its best educational services that it offers ..im sure of it
