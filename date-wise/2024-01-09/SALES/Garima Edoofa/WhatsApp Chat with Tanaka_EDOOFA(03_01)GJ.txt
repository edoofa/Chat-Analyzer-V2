05/01/24, 4:51 pm - +263 78 282 3843: The cost of education in Zimbabwe vary depend on type of institution (public or private) and the specific course of study.ln Zimbabwe, tuition fees for masters programs in public universities range from 1000dollars to 5000dollars per year depending on program and institution.
Private universities tend to have higher tuition fees and cost can be significantly higher like Zegu university it's 2000 to 10000per year
05/01/24, 5:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Tanaka I would like you to inform you, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/01/24, 5:04 pm - +263 78 282 3843: I agree a lot on these costs
05/01/24, 5:07 pm - +263 78 282 3843: Yes l agree on that but varies also with the university , private universities cost high then public universities this 2024 are costing also a lower than private
05/01/24, 5:16 pm - +263 78 282 3843: I was researching also on Indian institute of technology -chennai it cost 209550 year fees ,new Delhi 70000,flame university ,pune ,its 1045000 rupees per year
05/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 282 3843: On the website link collegedunia.com/Indian universities ?

05/01/24, 6:50 pm - Garima Edoofa: International students are not eligible for public universities abroad as they are only reserved for tax payers of that country that is the reason cost is low as tax is being paid by their families so all seats are reserved for native students .
