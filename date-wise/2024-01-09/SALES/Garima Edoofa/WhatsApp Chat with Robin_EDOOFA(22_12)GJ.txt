C in Commerce
C in Literature in English
B in Geography
C in Combined Science
And a C in Indigenous Language. I proceeded to A level....and I got 7 points in an Art combination of History(e)
Family and Religious Studies(B)
Literature in English (D)
It's very unfortunate that my father passed on when I was about to go for form 1 and I had noone to pay for my fees...which was $55 per term. My mother and my father were divorced long back...my mother was and is still a housewife she has never been employed so paying for my fees was something she was totally incapable of doing. Thanks to my nephew whom I only saw once......he is the one who paid for my fees up until A' level but he is no longer capable of paying for my tertiary. The course I always wanted to go is Law. Since I was a little kid I always wished to be a lawyer one day. My weakness i am not so sure but as for my strength.... my strength is my bitter past and it keeps pushing me to looking forward for the best and I am a guy of optimism. My hobbies are singing and playing soccer.

So, now that you have a clear picture of your career and an understanding of the programme, do you know which countries Edoofa suggests for higher education?
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Unmm I don't know honestly.....
03/01/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
03/01/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
03/01/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:11 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/01/24, 3:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, don't you think it is affordable for you and for your family?
03/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 78 687 8577: I think if I earn as I learn I may manage it myself because my mom is not in any position to pay for me....but if I earn as l learn I will like it
03/01/24, 3:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Some students have catered their annual fees through The Earn While You Learn program.
03/01/24, 3:25 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Yeah I would like that
03/01/24, 3:25 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Robin what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*


*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
03/01/24, 3:26 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Yes
03/01/24, 3:27 pm - +263 78 687 8577: So is it not possible for me to just earn as I learn because honestly my mother can't pay that amount but If you allow me I will do the earn as I learn to enhance my education
03/01/24, 3:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Robin, I would like to inform you that we as an organisation there are certain rules too, once the student has cleared the interview with the program director and get himself/herself enrolled then the student is eligible for the Earn While You Learn Program.
03/01/24, 3:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.


It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
03/01/24, 3:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
03/01/24, 3:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 3:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
03/01/24, 3:47 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Ok
03/01/24, 3:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
03/01/24, 3:49 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Yes
03/01/24, 4:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
03/01/24, 4:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/01/24, 5:11 pm - +263 78 687 8577: I'm willing to work hard for it
03/01/24, 5:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
03/01/24, 5:17 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Okay thank you Ms Garima....have a blessed night too
04/01/24, 10:04 am - +263 78 687 8577: Good morning Ms Garima
04/01/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning, Hope you are doing well.
04/01/24, 10:05 am - +263 78 687 8577: I'm doing good
04/01/24, 10:05 am - Garima Edoofa: I am here to start with your counseling session, shall we start?
04/01/24, 10:06 am - +263 78 687 8577: Yes we can
04/01/24, 10:27 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
04/01/24, 10:27 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
04/01/24, 10:30 am - +263 78 687 8577: Point number 2 and 3
04/01/24, 11:41 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Robin, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
04/01/24, 11:55 am - +263 78 687 8577: Yes
04/01/24, 12:26 pm - +263 77 309 0102: Good afternoon Ms Garima
04/01/24, 12:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Greetings @263773090102
04/01/24, 12:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Robin, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
04/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Yes I'm ready
04/01/24, 12:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Robin as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying to multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
04/01/24, 12:53 pm - +263 78 687 8577: If its 300 it would be $1500....for 5 universities
04/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
04/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
04/01/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
04/01/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.
Don’t you think so?
04/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 78 687 8577: I wanted to complete the application but honestly....no one will pay that $350 for me...because my mother hardly finds even a dollar so I don't think I will qualify
04/01/24, 1:40 pm - +263 78 687 8577: Everything is nice and affordable but my mother unmm she is not capable Ms Garima

For me to have a better understanding and align with your thoughts on how are your daily expenses being catered to since you mentioned you want to pursue LAW, I would like to understand that is your mother aware of the same and have she made any future plans on how is going to cater your higher education for example, any investment or saving?
04/01/24, 6:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you on *tomorrow again at 10:00 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

Have a good night
God Bless You!

Lately, our conversations have been a bit disrupted due to the timing not aligning with our available hours. I remain hopeful that we can have a smoother conversation on Monday at 10:00 a.m., CAT. Your availability would be greatly appreciated; however, if you're unable to make it, please understand that, as an organization, we strive to be fair to all students. I may have to consider closing your application to ensure fairness in providing opportunities to other deserving students.
