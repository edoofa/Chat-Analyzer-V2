However, we have dedicated school heads and student families in Zimbabwe who proudly represent our program. You have the opportunity to meet them in person. Additionally, we have established partnerships with over 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabwe since you are living in Harare let me give you more relatable example we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries ,Hilbright Science College , St.Mary , St.Ignatius and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School.

We also have many former students from your school currently in India like 
Yvonne Tanatswa Bamu
Praise Tendaiishe Mutandahuruva and many more
