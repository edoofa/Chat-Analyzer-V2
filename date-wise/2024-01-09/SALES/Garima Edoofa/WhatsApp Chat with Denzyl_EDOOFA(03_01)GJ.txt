06/01/24, 4:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.

08/01/24, 7:19 pm - Garima Edoofa: Hi, I hope you are doing well!

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible and employment-oriented higher education program.

I will be waiting for your response.
