28/12/23, 10:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 278 9814: Yes I’ve been wondering

28/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 278 9814: I don’t understand do you mind explaining
28/12/23, 11:23 am - Garima Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, it is my lunch break and we'll be connecting shortly after One Hour.
28/12/23, 12:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Good day, I am back from my lunch, shall we start?
28/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Yaa sure
28/12/23, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate what you did not understood?
28/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Does it mean that after I am done with the program it will be easy for me to get a job in India?
28/12/23, 12:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Thank you for the question, Jerome, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying jobs!

You see the whole purpose of the Earn While You Learn Program is to make the students of Edoofa so competent that by the time they reach the final year of their education, they should be able to get good job opportunities.
28/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky …. Thank you it’s now clear
28/12/23, 2:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Jerome, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
28/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 278 9814: 1) studying in India will give me a chance to focus on my studies without any distractions 

2)I feel like I will have an opportunity to work abroad
28/12/23, 2:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Jerome. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the students is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
28/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 278 9814: I have no idea
28/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
28/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 14 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky that is amazing… what about students who are on scholarships
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Jerome what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same?
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on that?
28/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Ohh oky now I understand
28/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 278 9814: It’s very good
28/12/23, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
28/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Yes ma’am
28/12/23, 3:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/12/23, 3:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/12/23, 4:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*
29/12/23, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Good morning, hope you’re doing well.

As discussed yesterday, I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
29/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 77 278 9814: Good morning ma’am …. I’m sorry about yesterday I was not feeling well
29/12/23, 10:00 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand, I hope you are doing well now.
29/12/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 278 9814: Feeling much better now
29/12/23, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright moving ahead.
29/12/23, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/12/23, 10:26 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

29/12/23, 10:27 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
29/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 278 9814: M looking forward to experiencing that too
29/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 278 9814: So are there any students you helped on the earn while you learn program?
29/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 278 9814: This is exactly what I am looking for
29/12/23, 11:28 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate that you are also looking for the same.
29/12/23, 11:31 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes indeed, we have many students with us.

Later in our session I would be connecting you with some of our students who are already the part of the program.
29/12/23, 11:32 am - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
29/12/23, 11:32 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
29/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 278 9814: Oky ma’am I am looking forward to talking to them
29/12/23, 11:33 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes please.
29/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 278 9814: I think point 2 drew my attention most
29/12/23, 11:35 am - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Jerome, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
29/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 278 9814: Yes my mom will be helping me with the finances
29/12/23, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Jerome, I would want your mother to come active and acknowledge the same in the form of a voice note.
29/12/23, 5:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for TUESDAY 2nd January at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
29/12/23, 5:01 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 10:47 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263772789814 @27848852800 , I hope you all are doing well.
02/01/24, 10:48 am - Garima Edoofa: As discussed I am here to continue with our counseling session, shall we start?
02/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 278 9814: Good morning ma’am
02/01/24, 11:34 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Jerome I was expecting your mother to come active and acknowledge the same in the form of a voice note.
02/01/24, 11:38 am - +263 77 278 9814: She is at work but she promised to send a voice note as soon as she gets off today
02/01/24, 11:42 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Jerome.
02/01/24, 11:43 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Jerome, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
02/01/24, 11:48 am - +263 77 278 9814: Yes I am
02/01/24, 12:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Jerome as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/01/24, 12:52 pm - +263 77 278 9814: So are they any chances that I can be denied
02/01/24, 12:53 pm - Garima Edoofa: Jerome I would like you to answer this question that I just asked you?
02/01/24, 1:03 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky sorry … let’s say a student applies I 5 universities at the cost of 450 he will be paying 2250 usd

But if the same student pays 300 per application he will only use 1500
02/01/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/01/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 1:05 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
02/01/24, 1:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/01/24, 1:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
02/01/24, 1:16 pm - +263 77 278 9814: I really appreciate the program
02/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 278 9814: That’s good
02/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 278 9814: So is this done on the internet?
02/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Yaa and it also sounds safe
02/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Jerome basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
02/01/24, 1:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky that’s sounds fantastic
02/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky that is reasonable
02/01/24, 1:42 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Talking of the A level results…. How many points do you require
02/01/24, 1:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
02/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Yaa the Covid pandemic really affected our education
02/01/24, 1:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, and that is the reason the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
02/01/24, 1:48 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky thank you…. It’s nice to know that the Edoofa program is giving us access to good education
02/01/24, 1:49 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Oky
02/01/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please, I appreciate that.
02/01/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Jerome, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
02/01/24, 1:56 pm - +263 77 278 9814: I have understood that’s edoofa is making the %50 scholarship very accessible and  cheap as evidenced by the payment plan …. I understand that Edoof makes studying in India very cheap and affordable than local universities , adding on with the earn while you learn program which supplements the school fees . Therefore this makes Edoofa a  first choice
02/01/24, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
02/01/24, 1:59 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Understood
02/01/24, 2:00 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes Jerome and I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
02/01/24, 2:00 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Yes ma’am
02/01/24, 2:02 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
02/01/24, 2:03 pm - +263 77 278 9814: Sorry to ask this but I’ve been wondering since this scholarship program helps many countries will there be any race problems such as racism ?
02/01/24, 2:04 pm - +263 77 278 9814: I’m not aware
02/01/24, 2:10 pm - Garima Edoofa: I would rate racism in India for international students as a 3 on a scale of 1-10. India is a big country so you see, a person might face some challenges, however since it is not overly widespread or severe. If a person has well researched about India he/she would find that people are welcoming and open to interacting with international students.

In addition, there are many initiatives in India to combat racism and reduce its prevalence. For example, there are various anti-discrimination laws, as well as several organizations working to promote social harmony and respect for diversity.

Furthermore, most universities in India have a strict policy against racism and they strive to create a safe and inclusive environment for all students. International students are encouraged to report any incidents of racism and the universities take appropriate action to address them.

Overall, while racism is a problem that needs to be addressed worldwide, it is not a major issue in India and international students can generally feel safe and accepted in the country.
02/01/24, 2:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: As the academic board was going through your result I think there is a mismatch and to clear that may I know what is the year of passing your A-level?
02/01/24, 2:30 pm - +263 77 278 9814: 2021
02/01/24, 2:32 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please share the picture of your A-level result with me?
02/01/24, 2:32 pm - +263 77 278 9814: I only have the portal one
02/01/24, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand you can share that with me, please.
02/01/24, 3:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?
02/01/24, 3:28 pm - +27 84 885 2800: Good day, i hope you are well i really appreciate everything you have done so far for my son.
02/01/24, 3:28 pm - +27 84 885 2800: I think he's phone it's now off because his battery was low
02/01/24, 3:30 pm - +27 84 885 2800: Can i please have EDOOFA email address
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please, If you want to enquire you can enquire at academicboard@edoofa.com and studentwelfare@edoofa.com.
02/01/24, 3:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: Thank you for asking I am doing good and thank you for your kind words we wish the same for Jerome.
02/01/24, 5:16 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for tomorrow at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation*      
                                                                                                                                                                                   Have a good night

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Thursday on “04-01-24” at 10:00 AM CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
