Case Studies and Practical Applications: Incorporating case studies and real-world examples of how technology influences and shapes business operations is a common practice in BBA programs. Analyzing cases where IT has been instrumental in business success or failure helps students understand the practical implications of technology in different industries.

Internships and Practical Experience: Many BBA programs encourage or require internships or practical experiences. Students might intern at companies where they can apply their business knowledge in conjunction with IT systems. This hands-on experience helps students understand how businesses leverage technology in real-world scenarios.

Industry-Relevant Projects: BBA programs often involve group projects or capstone experiences where students work on solving real business problems using IT solutions. These projects allow students to apply their knowledge gained throughout the program to address contemporary business challenges.

Have a good night
God Bless You!
28/12/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
29/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 71 523 9347: Morning Ms Garima
29/12/23, 9:20 am - Garima Edoofa: Good morning, hope you’re doing well.

As discussed yesterday, I am here to continue our session, shall we start?
29/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 523 9347: Yes

29/12/23, 10:35 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Innocent, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
29/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 523 9347: No
29/12/23, 2:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate on that?
29/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Yes I agree typing error
29/12/23, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
29/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 523 9347: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 523 9347: But why Indian alone
29/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 523 9347: India I mean
29/12/23, 2:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please, let me help you in giving more clarity on it.

29/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 523 9347: So it was the colony of Britain
29/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 523 9347: I see
29/12/23, 2:46 pm - Garima Edoofa: May I know if you understood everything properly?
29/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
29/12/23, 2:54 pm - Garima Edoofa: Okay well Innocent, since you have understood all the reasons properly as well, can you now tell me:-

1)How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career?

2)How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
29/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 523 9347: I think studying in India will boost me through providing me with better institutions etc
29/12/23, 3:04 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Innocent. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students are capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
29/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 523 9347: No
29/12/23, 3:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 6-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
29/12/23, 3:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:13 pm - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 3:14 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Innocent what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we allow the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok I understand
29/12/23, 3:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your thoughts on the same?
29/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 523 9347: I think schoolarship is the best
29/12/23, 3:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please elaborate what exactly do you mean by scholarship?
29/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 523 9347: a grant or payment made to support a student's education,
29/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Am I  correct
29/12/23, 3:45 pm - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
29/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Can I ask
29/12/23, 3:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please.
29/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Edoofa falls under which program between the 2
29/12/23, 4:30 pm - Garima Edoofa: As per what we have discussed so far what according to you does EDOOFA fall in ?
29/12/23, 4:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for TUESDAY 2nd January at 10 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
29/12/23, 4:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Schoolarship I think
02/01/24, 9:57 am - +263 71 523 9347: Morning Ms Garima
02/01/24, 10:25 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263715239347 , hope you are doing well/
02/01/24, 10:25 am - Garima Edoofa: As discussed earlier I am here to continue with our session, shall we start?
02/01/24, 10:36 am - +263 71 523 9347: Do we have session today
02/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
02/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
02/01/24, 10:53 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes correct.
02/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
02/01/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
02/01/24, 10:55 am - +263 71 523 9347: Yes Ms Garima
02/01/24, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
02/01/24, 10:56 am - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
02/01/24, 10:57 am - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
02/01/24, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/01/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: 2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
02/01/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi

02/01/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 11:18 am - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
02/01/24, 11:18 am - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
02/01/24, 12:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
02/01/24, 12:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

03/01/24, 9:26 am - +263 71 523 9347: Sorry I was busy
03/01/24, 9:41 am - Garima Edoofa: Good Morning @263715239347 , Hope you are doing well.
03/01/24, 9:42 am - Garima Edoofa: @263715239347 I would like to inform you as EDOOFA receives more than 1277 plus applications a day and EDOOFA being a fair scholarship program gives equal opportunity to all the students in that case I would want you to complete your application in the next 48 hours or we would be forced to close it.
03/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 71 523 9347: How can I apply
03/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 71 523 9347: Can you help me My counselor Ms Garima to apply
03/01/24, 10:54 am - Garima Edoofa: You can complete your application by completing your counseling session in the next 48 hours.
03/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 10:54 am - +263 71 523 9347: Let's do it pliz
03/01/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: Since we were talking about EWYL. Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling
03/01/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: 1.*Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.*Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.*Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.*Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
03/01/24, 11:45 am - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
03/01/24, 1:12 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Number 4 and 2
03/01/24, 1:14 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Sorry for late replies I was recharging the cellphone
03/01/24, 1:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Innocent, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
03/01/24, 1:15 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand.
03/01/24, 1:15 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 1:18 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Meaning they will be paying the whole amounts
03/01/24, 1:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Innocent, basically once we complete your counseling session I would give you time to properly discuss about your entire application once again with your family members so that they too could have much better clarity regarding the same. Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
03/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
03/01/24, 1:23 pm - +263 71 523 9347: I am ready
03/01/24, 1:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: Innocent as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
03/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 71 523 9347: It is expensive
03/01/24, 1:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: Can you please to the question that I had just asked?
03/01/24, 1:27 pm - +263 71 523 9347: I don't understand
03/01/24, 1:28 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok if the student applies to 5 universities the cost will be 1500
03/01/24, 1:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
03/01/24, 1:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 1:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
03/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 71 523 9347: I understand
03/01/24, 1:29 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 1:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
03/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 1:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
03/01/24, 1:35 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Yea
03/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
03/01/24, 1:36 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 1:36 pm - Garima Edoofa: Innocent basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
03/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Can I ask Edoofa takes how man intakes per year
03/01/24, 1:37 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa takes one intake internationally that is July and August.
03/01/24, 1:39 pm - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
03/01/24, 1:39 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok August is the best
03/01/24, 1:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: Did you read this?
03/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ooo sorry let me see
03/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok that's a great thing
03/01/24, 1:42 pm - Garima Edoofa: Innocent, as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspect of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his finances all by himself (in 80 to 100 words)?
03/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok I will
03/01/24, 1:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes, please.
03/01/24, 1:44 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am waiting for your response.
03/01/24, 2:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected ?
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Okay  I understand that  if the student is willing to pay at his or her own  for the application to universities for example each university cost between 300-450 so the cost will be greater than when the student is being assisted by the Edoofa program because it will be 750 and due to covid pandemic Edoofa program has reduced the fees to $350  because most African nations are facing economic challenges so the fee of applying will be paid in 7 days to make it better to parents and it will be paid in small quantities 200 in first 7 days and 150 in the next 30 days
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Am I correct Ms Garima
03/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Yes
03/01/24, 2:37 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you
*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications,SOP,Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions etc all you need to pay is $350
 
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee,Accommodation,Food,Wifi,Laundry,Library,Gym fee etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
03/01/24, 2:42 pm - +263 71 523 9347: Ok
03/01/24, 2:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/01/24, 2:56 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image I have shared.
03/01/24, 2:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
03/01/24, 2:57 pm - Garima Edoofa: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
03/01/24, 3:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected?

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
04/01/24, 10:29 am - Garima Edoofa: Mrs.Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

05/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 71 523 9347: She said it's a good program

Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .

I would like to ask you a few questions, but before that with immense pleasure, I would like to share the glimpses of the Africa Visit of our Founders which took place in June 2023! 

It was a much-awaited event and they were welcomed by Ministries, Educationalists, Edoofians, and Parents across different African Countries. This is a must-watch video depicting the Acceptance of the Program in the African Continent, especially in Zimbabwe!

05/01/24, 2:25 pm - +263 78 685 3897: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:26 pm - +263 71 523 9347: That's my mother Ms Garima
05/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
05/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
05/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
05/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/01/24, 2:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 12th or 13th January 2024 for $200 and the 12th or 13th of February for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 12th or 13th January 2024. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
