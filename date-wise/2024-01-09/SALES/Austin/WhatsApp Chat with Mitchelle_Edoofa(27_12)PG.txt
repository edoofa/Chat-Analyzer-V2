29/12/23, 11:54 am - +27 65 730 0423: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mitchelle,

Acquiring cross-cultural communication skills, independence, and a global outlook will undoubtedly open doors to a range of exciting career possibilities. The exposure to new cultures, languages, and academic opportunities not only prepares you for the working world but also enriches your overall perspective.
29/12/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this.
29/12/23, 11:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
29/12/23, 12:02 pm - +27 65 730 0423: No mam
29/12/23, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
29/12/23, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
29/12/23, 12:11 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam it will affordable and I really thank you Edoofa family for such a helping hand
29/12/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
29/12/23, 12:36 pm - +27 65 730 0423: From my understanding based on one of the videos is that if I do assignments or any role for Edoofa I will be receiving credits for completing the assignment or duty <This message was edited>
29/12/23, 12:40 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Meaning that as I contribute to the Edoofa family while also increasing my skills I will receive credits that may help reduce some of my costs
29/12/23, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/12/23, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/12/23, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
29/12/23, 12:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

29/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
29/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
29/12/23, 1:00 pm - +27 65 730 0423: My views are actually that Edoofa is prioritizing my development as individual that has no experience in the working world and they helping me obtain skills that may later on help in my career going forth. The tasks will help me meet deadlines as workplaces require that as a basic necessity, and its teaching me self discipline. And I believe i will benefit from the program as I pursue my career. The program will also decrease financial burdens on my parents helping them save the money and also teaching me how to save before finishing school meaning I will obtain alot of qualities that I will use in future for my day to day living. So it will not disturb my studies but instead enhance them
29/12/23, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
29/12/23, 1:12 pm - +27 65 730 0423: I understand mam
29/12/23, 1:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!
29/12/23, 1:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - +27 65 730 0423: 4
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
29/12/23, 1:18 pm - +27 65 730 0423: My parents will be helping me with the remaining fee
29/12/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
29/12/23, 1:22 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Thank you mam and yes

My parents are excited as they only desire what's best for me and my dad discovered your program as he knew that my future would be secured in your hands and that I will receive the best education anyone can ask for. So I conclude they are very happy about this opportunity
29/12/23, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mitchelle, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
29/12/23, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
29/12/23, 1:32 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Yess it is mam
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
29/12/23, 1:37 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Yes please mam
29/12/23, 1:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
29/12/23, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

29/12/23, 1:58 pm - +27 65 730 0423: I understand mam

29/12/23, 2:01 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Stage 5
29/12/23, 2:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
29/12/23, 2:02 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
29/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright
29/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
29/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
29/12/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
29/12/23, 2:24 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Yes mam
29/12/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
29/12/23, 3:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

I also explained to them Edoofa vision in helping students with the finances and also providing opportunities and new skills for them and also discovering their full potential. I explained to them that Edoofa offer 50-100% ranging tuition for selected individuals and I showed them the prices they would pay once I am eligible or chosen. I also explained that Edoofa will help with the visa and the application for my course which they were impressed about as it would give them less stress and more assurance , I explain the earn while you earn and how the credits are given to student and how they help.
01/01/24, 5:56 pm - +27 65 730 0423: That would be about it sir.
01/01/24, 5:57 pm - Austin: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through our entire conversation which we did during your counselling session!

I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. So may I know if your family has any queries, please
01/01/24, 5:58 pm - +27 65 730 0423: No they do not sir
01/01/24, 5:59 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
01/01/24, 6:07 pm - +27 65 730 0423: My parents were very concerned at first knowing that the enrollment overseas is usually costy  but I had told them Edoofa not only helps but it also reduces the fee to $350 and I explained the time frame they are given to pay the money so they became at ease knowing that Edoofa helps students pay for the fee. Explaining to them the cost of education was the easiest part as I told them the normal figures without Edoofa and then the fee with Edoofa where they saw a big change  which means they can save while I study for my other siblings . And I explained that other countries are more expensive when it comes to education compared to India which has more opportunities.
01/01/24, 6:08 pm - Austin: It is good to see that you have discussed in details and guided your family well through the learnings and aspects of the program!

04/01/24, 8:00 pm - Austin: Since you are in SA, there is a cheaper mode known as Mama Money, have you heard of it?
04/01/24, 8:01 pm - Austin: The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
04/01/24, 8:02 pm - +27 65 730 0423: No sir
04/01/24, 8:02 pm - +27 65 730 0423: I understand sir
04/01/24, 8:10 pm - Austin: Mama money is a cheaper mode of payment from South Africa through which you can pay in Rands at the nearby shops. 

There are two options for the same, 1) We have Mrs. Christine Rockson, the Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, Kempton Park Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa who has her child, Tadiwanashe Rockson studying in India under the Edoofa program!

She has been helping parents in South Africa to create Mama Money orders for the payment of enrollment fees. We will share the Mama Money order with you. You can visit nearby shops to pay the order

2) We can share the order with you and you can proceed with the transaction at the nearby shops <This message was edited>

04/01/24, 8:12 pm - +27 65 730 0423: Can I confirm with my parents sir
