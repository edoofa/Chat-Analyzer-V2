26/12/23, 2:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe ,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. I am here at the scheduled time to have a discussion about your academic journey futher. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
26/12/23, 3:30 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Good Day Ma'am.
Sorry for the late response, we have been having network challenges but am ready for the discussion!
26/12/23, 3:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Before we start our session for today, May I know if you remember the benefits shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
26/12/23, 3:42 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Benefits of Edoofa Scholarship Program?
26/12/23, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: These one dear, May I know if you remember them?
26/12/23, 4:23 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes l remember them!
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me continue from there in that case.
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
26/12/23, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/12/23, 4:40 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Crystal clear!
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
26/12/23, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/12/23, 4:57 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Understood
26/12/23, 5:02 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/12/23, 5:03 PM - +263 71 359 5826: No ma'am
26/12/23, 5:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
26/12/23, 7:50 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma'am!
26/12/23, 7:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *QUEST GROUP OF INSTITUTIONS* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

5/1/24, 11:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263713595826
8/1/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kudakwashe ,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
8/1/24, 3:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
8/1/24, 3:54 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Good Afternoon Ma'am!

We did go through the newsletter thoroughly.
8/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
8/1/24, 4:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
8/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Okay, thank you!
8/1/24, 4:02 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes please!
8/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
8/1/24, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) What's your Miscellaneous and Uniform Fee (applicable for first year only) ?
4) What's your University Related and Examination fee [Per annum] ?
5) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
8/1/24, 4:14 PM - +263 71 359 5826: 1.$1000 USD
2.$700 USD for a normal room
3.$100 USD
4.$75 per annum, $25 per semester
5.$1000 USD
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please allow me to correct you here The University Related and Examination fee per annum is $50. As you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1000.
						
Along with this, there is a $50 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $50 to the per annum tuition fee of $1000, the total comes out to be $1050.
8/1/24, 4:20 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Noted!
8/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Thanks for the correction.
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If a student wishes to get a more affordable accommodation, they can stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
8/1/24, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $600 per annum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1050  + $600 = $1650. I hope you are clear about this?
8/1/24, 4:25 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Crystal clear!
8/1/24, 4:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
8/1/24, 4:29 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor their higher education, you can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma'am!
8/1/24, 4:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1650 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1650 - $1000 = $650 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
8/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma'am!
8/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 19th 2024*.
8/1/24, 4:40 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
8/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes please, I don't quite remember the details clearly.
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $450 before the first deadline date of *January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $450 before the second deadline date of *February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before January 19th, 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
8/1/24, 4:49 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes, thank you for clarifying!
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
8/1/24, 4:51 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes,l am currently residing in Harare
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
8/1/24, 4:56 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Noted!
8/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
8/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
8/1/24, 5:02 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes please!
I will have to discuss with my family which method they are more comfortable with when they return from work.
8/1/24, 5:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738

8/1/24, 5:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263713595826. Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Yes ma'am, I did not quite understand on the waiver that is offered on the hostel fee.
8/1/24, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Could you please elaborate your query ?
8/1/24, 5:27 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Is it offered at the end of each year or when l finish my program?
8/1/24, 5:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear, I am not able to understand your query here, May I know which offer have you mentioned here ?
8/1/24, 5:30 PM - +263 71 359 5826: The waiver of $150 on the hostel fee
8/1/24, 5:41 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share that you can go for the off-campus accommodation dear
8/1/24, 5:45 PM - +263 71 359 5826: Okay thanks
8/1/24, 5:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome dear, Let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
						
It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.

8/1/24, 5:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:53 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on Wednesday at 4:00 PM. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
