I trust this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to the response from your side, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. 

I am more than willing to continue with your journey, Hence I wanted to understand if there is something that is bothering you. If you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the discussion. If my understanding is correct, I am assuming that you have something that you want to share with us, right?
