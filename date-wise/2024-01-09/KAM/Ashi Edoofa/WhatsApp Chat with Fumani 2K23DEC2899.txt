8/1/24, 4:34 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Done reading thank you we may proceed
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes they are clear
8/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
8/1/24, 4:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
8/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes I am following
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
8/1/24, 4:50 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Very clear thank you
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 4:53 PM - +263 77 341 0203: Yes i believe we may
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

8/1/24, 6:44 PM - +263 77 341 0203: In my understanding of the first video we are introduced to the Edoofa Co-Founders and the video generally focuses on the most important aspects and qualities required from Edoofians ,these being an open minded individual and be very teachable.The other major point is having Decipline especially with following the Edoofa instructions as this will make the process very quick and as enjoyable as possible.

The Co-Founders also showcase the Edoofa Scholarship wall of Fame 
And confirm that all the students/Edoofians involved are very happy,smiling and leading their dream lives.

The second video defines in detail the traits that distinguishes the successful students from the rest of the Crowd.The importance of making employable and relyable students and how Edoofa  contributes to this.The SEELS program is also mentioned and explained.

The third video mainly focuses on the Educational Institutions involved/working with Edoofa,about 250 schools if i am not mistaken.It also highlights how trustworthy and quick Edoofa is as compared to other Programs,which also take long.A short story about a student who wished to travel to China and payed a different agency an excessive amount of money   and was dissapointed.

The forth and final Video focuses preparing to interact in sessions with Schools.The video touches on the Statement of Purpose (SOP).It explains why the SOP is very important and that it is the most important step to secure a good scholarship.
8/1/24, 6:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear, I am highly impressed with your insights. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
8/1/24, 6:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
8/1/24, 6:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
