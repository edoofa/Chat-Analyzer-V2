I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.

6/1/24, 12:06 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly. 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
6/1/24, 12:22 PM - +267 75 038 731: Good day sorry for been late
6/1/24, 12:25 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Good day

6/1/24, 12:34 PM - +267 75 038 731: Can you please explain on the issue of 50% scholarship and accommodation
6/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No worries please,  As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
6/1/24, 12:34 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
6/1/24, 12:43 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Ok thanks
6/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
6/1/24, 12:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
6/1/24, 12:59 PM - +267 75 038 731: 1) 1800USD
2) 3 years 
3) 300USD
4) 750USD
6/1/24, 1:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
6/1/24, 1:17 PM - +267 75 038 731: Yes it does thank you
6/1/24, 1:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
6/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
6/1/24, 1:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
6/1/24, 1:53 PM - +267 75 038 731: So this means the scholarship doesn’t cover accommodation
6/1/24, 2:01 PM - Ashi Edoofa: @26775038731 The accommodation is covered in the scholarship please. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
6/1/24, 2:06 PM - +267 75 038 731: Thank you for the clarity
6/1/24, 2:10 PM - +267 75 038 731: so what are the requirements that we are supposed to adhere to as parents
6/1/24, 2:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I will be assisting your regarding the same soon @26775038731. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
6/1/24, 2:21 PM - +267 75 038 731: Yes we are understnd
6/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
6/1/24, 2:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on January 19th 2024*. I hope we are together so far?
6/1/24, 4:08 PM - +267 75 038 731: Yes we are together
6/1/24, 4:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
6/1/24, 4:32 PM - +267 75 038 731: Yes I would appreciate if you explain
6/1/24, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $650  of the registration fee. This $650 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$325 before the first deadline date of January 19th, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$325  before the second deadline date of February 19th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
6/1/24, 4:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $650 within 15 working days, before *January 19th 2024*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
6/1/24, 4:59 PM - +267 75 038 731: Now its very clear
6/1/24, 4:59 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
6/1/24, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
6/1/24, 5:35 PM - +267 75 038 731: We are based in Harare
6/1/24, 8:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
6/1/24, 8:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
6/1/24, 8:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
6/1/24, 8:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As I was waiting for your response, Kindly do let me know when you will be able to reconnect with us so that we can complete our discussion. Looking forward for your response, Have a good night ahead!
8/1/24, 3:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Samantha , Wishing you a good day! 

In regards to our previous conversation, I would like to know if you are ready for our today's discussion so that we can discuss about your offer letter. I've been looking forward to our today's discussion to plan the next steps in your admission process. Could you please share your response with us ?
8/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Good afternoon
8/1/24, 4:29 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Yes continue
8/1/24, 4:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response @263772956265, May I know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan contact ?
8/1/24, 4:33 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Yes l have thank you
8/1/24, 4:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
8/1/24, 4:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
8/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Oky
8/1/24, 4:41 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Yeah kindly do so
8/1/24, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Thanks
8/1/24, 4:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Oky
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - +263 77 295 6265: So the scholarship covers all the costs or ?
8/1/24, 4:58 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263772956265, The scholarship covers all the cost, I am sure you have got the better clarity of the fees break up now, right ?
8/1/24, 4:58 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Yes l do thanks
8/1/24, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
8/1/24, 5:03 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 77 295 6265: Yeah we are following
8/1/24, 5:11 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
8/1/24, 5:12 PM - +263 77 295 6265: I understand 😊
8/1/24, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
8/1/24, 5:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
8/1/24, 5:13 PM - +263 77 295 6265: So far so good I understood you clearly
8/1/24, 5:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
