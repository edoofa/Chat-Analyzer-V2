I hope you are doing well and blessed. Over the past couple of months I have been trying to reach out to you with regards to the admission process. It seems all my efforts are in vain now. I would like to let you know that all of your peers have completed or started the admission process. I strongly encourage us to proceed with the admission process so that we do not fall behind schedule and might be losing out on the opportunities that lies ahead of you. Hence if you are receiving my messages please let me know so that we can continue your admission process.
