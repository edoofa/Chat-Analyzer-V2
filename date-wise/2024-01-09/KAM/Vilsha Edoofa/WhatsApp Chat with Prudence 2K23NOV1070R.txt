10/11/23, 9:41 AM - ~ Shashwat Edoofa created group "Prudence 2K23NOV1070R"
19/12/23, 10:20 AM - You joined using this group's invite link
19/12/23, 11:00 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand and appreciate the update, Prudence. Once you've completed the payment of your remaining fee, kindly share the payment receipt with us. This will enable us to liaise with the accounts team for confirmation and update your scholarship application accordingly.
19/12/23, 11:00 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Moving forward, now that we've concluded discussions on your statement of purpose and received updates on the remaining portion of your enrollment, let us proceed with the next steps in our conversation.
19/12/23, 11:02 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Okay, noted
19/12/23, 11:02 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: To confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Bachelors of Commerce and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India as per the August 2025 intake. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/12/23, 11:03 AM - +263 77 487 2765: We may proceed
19/12/23, 11:06 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes it is
19/12/23, 11:08 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation, Prudence. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.

To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a *Financial Secure Plan* that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes.
19/12/23, 11:12 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year.
19/12/23, 11:12 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education. Therefore, the *Financial Secure Plan* that we have designed aims to alleviate such financial pressure and streamline the process of your arrival to India. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
19/12/23, 11:14 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes can you tell me more about this *Financial Secure Plan*
19/12/23, 11:15 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Prudence. *Edoofa Financial Secure Plan* is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:
19/12/23, 11:15 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship is offered so that they are not caught off guard.
19/12/23, 11:16 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on your parents when you are ready to join university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
19/12/23, 11:16 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.
19/12/23, 11:16 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
19/12/23, 11:16 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.
19/12/23, 11:16 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving a child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
19/12/23, 11:17 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when political reforms are changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Financial Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.
19/12/23, 11:17 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: *Peace of Mind:* Having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
19/12/23, 11:19 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Now Prudence, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
19/12/23, 11:20 AM - +263 77 487 2765: It definitely is what we need
19/12/23, 11:21 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am happy to hear that Prudence. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
19/12/23, 11:25 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes you may proceed
19/12/23, 11:34 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Alright, Prudence, as you are aware, we are currently in December 2023, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
19/12/23, 11:34 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
19/12/23, 11:34 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
19/12/23, 11:37 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes I agree with that, it's manageable
19/12/23, 11:37 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Right, Prudence, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
19/12/23, 11:38 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
19/12/23, 11:38 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
19/12/23, 11:42 AM - +263 77 487 2765: This plan can be really helpful
19/12/23, 11:44 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed Prudence. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
19/12/23, 11:44 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
19/12/23, 11:44 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
19/12/23, 11:44 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
19/12/23, 11:45 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes that's correct
19/12/23, 11:48 AM - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Prudence, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
19/12/23, 11:51 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes please, how can this be achieved?
19/12/23, 12:00 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 20, 2023.
19/12/23, 12:00 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Under the *Edoofa Financial Secure Plan*, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
19/12/23, 12:00 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
19/12/23, 12:15 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes
19/12/23, 12:17 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Does the 150 has to be deposited in your  account or our own savings account
19/12/23, 12:23 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Prudence, the monthly payments of $150 will be made into your dedicated account under the Edoofa Accounts Team. If you deposit the funds into your personal savings account in Zimbabwe, you will have to incur nominal charges to keep your account active each month, adding to your financial burden. 

Therefore, the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is designed to eliminate this burden for you and your family. If this addresses the query you had, shall I help you understand the reason why the Edoofa Financial Plan is mandatory for 10 months and not for 20 months?
19/12/23, 12:25 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Okay noted
19/12/23, 12:25 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Why is it mandatory for 10 months and not 20 months
19/12/23, 12:26 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Prudence, if you see the bigger picture, you will realize that the reason is quite simple. Upon the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will initiate the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities to secure their scholarship and their university seat.
19/12/23, 12:26 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Reserving seats earlier increases the chances of obtaining a maximum scholarship. A higher scholarship means lower fees, and by securing the seat, you will be entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university, not the new one implemented in January 2025. Furthermore, when applying to the universities, you will receive an offer letter or a letter of intent detailing the fees, scholarship, and registration fee.
19/12/23, 12:26 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: As explained during the enrollment process, the registration fee is a portion of your first-year university fee, paid to reserve the seat. It ranges from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. 

From the $1500 you saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university, securing the seat. For instance, if the registration fee is $1000, Edoofa will pay $1000 from the $1500 saved in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $500, which will be paid to the university upon your arrival in India.
19/12/23, 12:26 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: This eases the financial burden on the parent, as there is no immediate payment required upon the student's arrival. The $500 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year, as specified in the offer letter from the university. What are your thoughts on this?
19/12/23, 12:31 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Well this is explicit
19/12/23, 12:32 PM - +263 77 487 2765: In that case, I will share this with my parents
19/12/23, 12:38 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely, Prudence, this is something you will need to discuss with your parents and before doing so, as a student, it's important for you to understand all the details yourself. This way, you can help them better comprehend the process. Right?
19/12/23, 12:40 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes I will
19/12/23, 12:41 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far Prudence. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
19/12/23, 12:44 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes it is correct
19/12/23, 12:44 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
19/12/23, 12:45 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Okay
19/12/23, 12:45 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
19/12/23, 12:45 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
19/12/23, 12:49 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Sounds good
19/12/23, 12:50 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Prudence. Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 12:53 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Yes I have understood it
19/12/23, 1:00 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: That's great, Prudence. Now that you have all the information, I want you to take some time and discuss the financial security plan with your family members. Help them understand its importance and details. Once you're done, we can reconnect, have a discussion, and address any queries you may have. After resolving your concerns, I'll guide you through starting your financial security plan. 

While most students can discuss this with their parents the same day, I understand everyone is different. Could you let me know by when you think you'll have the discussion with your parents? This way, we can schedule our next session accordingly.
19/12/23, 1:23 PM - +263 77 487 2765: I will talk to them tomorrow
19/12/23, 2:31 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: That's perfectly fine, Prudence. In that case, we will conclude today's conversation, and I will connect with you on Thursday to resume our discussion. In the meantime, I hope you'll have a detailed discussion with your family and jot down any questions or thoughts you have regarding the Financial Secure plan.

Wishing you a good day ahead, and please extend our regards to your family.
19/12/23, 5:55 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Okay, thank you
20/12/23, 1:50 PM - +263 77 487 2765: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 2:06 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prudence,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for the remaining part of your enrollment fee. We have duly noted the same and have forwarded it to the accounts team as well for payment confirmation. 

Once the payment is confirmed, we will reach out to you and provide an update here in your admission group. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to let us know.
20/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 77 487 2765: It's okay thank you
20/12/23, 2:20 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome @263774872765.
26/12/23, 8:45 AM - +263 77 487 2765: Good morning
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Prudence,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to extend my apologies for not being able to connect with you the other day. I was caught up in a few meetings and, unfortunately, was not in a position to reach out. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
28/12/23, 1:16 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: On a positive note, during one of our recent meetings, I received an update from the accounts team regarding the payment you made for the remaining portion of your fee. I am pleased to inform you that the accounts team has confirmed receipt of the remaining enrollment fee. Below is the payment receipt for your reference -
28/12/23, 1:21 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 1:21 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you do that, we can reconnect and proceed with our discussion regarding the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan that we talked about the other day.
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Confirmed
28/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 77 487 2765: We are all well, Prudence will try to connect with you tomorrow, today we experienced power shortages so my battery is running out
28/12/23, 3:20 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: I see, and that is quite alright, @263774872765. Also, thank you for providing confirmation for the receipt. I understand that you are facing power challenges, which might hinder our connection today, but you plan to connect tomorrow. However, as it is the festive season here in India, I am afraid that for the next few days, we won't be available to connect with you. 

In such a case, we can schedule our discussion for next week on the 4th of January. May I know if that would be fine with you as well?
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - +263 77 487 2765: It's okay, no problem
Thank you and enjoy your holiday
28/12/23, 3:30 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding, @263774872765! We appreciate your flexibility. As we navigate the festive season, I want to extend my warmest wishes to you and your family for a joyous New Year. May it bring you prosperity, good health, and wonderful opportunities.
28/12/23, 3:30 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the holiday season, our team will be unavailable for the next few days. However, I look forward to reconnecting with you on the 4th of January to resume our discussion. If you have any urgent concerns or questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out.
28/12/23, 3:31 PM - Vilsha Edoofa: Wishing you a splendid holiday season and a fantastic start to the New Year!
28/12/23, 3:31 PM - +263 77 487 2765: Thank you and same to you too
