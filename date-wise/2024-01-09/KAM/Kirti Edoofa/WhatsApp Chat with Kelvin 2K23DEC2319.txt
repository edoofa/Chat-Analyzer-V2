8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
8/1/24, 4:21 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s clear
8/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
8/1/24, 4:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
8/1/24, 4:28 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Just to be clear on step two it means l will be communicating with a number of universities to get the offer letter from the multiple number of colleges as step 4 says?
8/1/24, 4:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, however, please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
8/1/24, 4:36 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s now clear let’s move on
8/1/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process, the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
8/1/24, 4:39 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
8/1/24, 4:42 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: It’s clear
8/1/24, 4:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
8/1/24, 4:48 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: Yes let’s proceed
8/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
8/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
8/1/24, 4:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

8/1/24, 5:46 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I have also learnt the aspect of Edoofa being present with their students through out the scholarship program as the founder said it that we need to take them as our parents
8/1/24, 5:49 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: I learn that Edoofa makes sure that their students get to universities that do not focus on making profits out of education but seeing that their students archive their goals and the founder gave an example of that university that had it walls not painted which shows that this university was just there to make a profit
8/1/24, 5:55 PM - +265 984 00 71 30: From this l learn that l have to be a person who will follow instructions as this will enable me to get the rightful scholarship that l desire
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
8/1/24, 6:27 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
