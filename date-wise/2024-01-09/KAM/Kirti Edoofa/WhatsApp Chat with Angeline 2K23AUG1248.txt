29/12/23, 8:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Angeline. 

I hope you are doing well. I understand your perspective, and I want to clarify a point regarding our recent communications. Upon reviewing the messages, there was indeed a clerical error on our end. This discrepancy was an oversight from our side, and it seems it wasn't noticed by you as well. The reason we share the breakdown with you as parents is to avoid these errors. I want to assure you that there's no intention to assign blame here; our focus is on finding a constructive way forward.
29/12/23, 8:23 PM - Kirti Edoofa: We have supported you in the past and continue to stand by you. What we need now is to figure out how best to proceed. Could you please share your plans for making the remaining deposit of $16?
