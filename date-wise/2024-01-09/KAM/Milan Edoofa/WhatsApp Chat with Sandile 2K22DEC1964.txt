27/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 580 2889: Hie
27/12/23, 3:00 PM - +263 77 580 2889: We are okay this side
27/12/23, 5:44 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l am well and how are you
27/12/23, 7:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that I am great too, thank you for asking. May I know if you are now prepared to take on the session for your admisson process?
27/12/23, 7:23 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l am prepared
27/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
27/12/23, 7:25 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/12/23, 7:26 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l have l concern l would like to raise
27/12/23, 7:52 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, please share it with me.
27/12/23, 7:59 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l would like to exit the scholarship program
27/12/23, 8:00 PM - +263 77 580 2889: We as parents wonder it is taking too longer to respond to this matter
27/12/23, 8:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know what happened?
27/12/23, 8:48 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l can no longer continue with the scholarship program because of certain personal issues
27/12/23, 8:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know, may I know if you might be able to share me with these issues ?
27/12/23, 8:50 PM - +263 77 580 2889: The issues are too personal
27/12/23, 8:51 PM - +263 78 019 2995: l am not able to tell you everything
27/12/23, 8:51 PM - +263 77 580 2889: We don't feel comfortable to disclose them and I hope you understand

8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Milan Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:57 PM - Milan Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
