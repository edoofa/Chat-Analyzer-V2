29/12/23, 2:27 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Okay
29/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 77 810 7361: I understood that we are going to move on to the fourth stage which is the offer letter since we completed the first three stages of the message from founders, the statement of purpose and university counselling
29/12/23, 3:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

29/12/23, 3:15 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?

29/12/23, 3:29 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Alright I understand everything
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
29/12/23, 3:35 PM - +263 77 810 7361: This is really great.There are so many advantages being an edoofa student
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
29/12/23, 4:06 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:27 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Ok the explanation is clear
29/12/23, 4:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
29/12/23, 4:28 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
29/12/23, 4:35 PM - +263 77 810 7361: Yes its clear
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
29/12/23, 4:54 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 30, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
30/12/23, 3:41 AM - +263 77 271 5565: Greetings. Our apologies for the late response and it was due network challenges from our side. I have few questions though and I was following all the above detailed narratives. First question is , will the student given a list of good universities to choose from and respective scholarship percentage being offered and the tuition fees after scholarship fees so that she and the parents can make a decision. Second question is on Endowment fee , I understand the fee will be deducted from the initial registration fee but  we are suggesting if you could give us more time to raise it since it will be a burden for us to raise it all together with the registration fee.Third question is on registration fee , I understand that you will be given ample time frame period of 30 to 45 days to settle the split amounts after a student is offered an offer letter, will the fees payable before or after the results have been released ,on this I was suggesting or proposing to pay the fees after the outcome of the results.Thank for your time and earlier explanations and we are eagerly looking forward for the response. Many thanks.
