5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

5/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Noted
5/1/24, 7:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I'm done
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
5/1/24, 7:16 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
5/1/24, 7:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Following
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
5/1/24, 8:18 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
5/1/24, 10:08 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes
5/1/24, 10:09 PM - +263 71 438 0324: My apologies I was not online for the past hours due to network challenges

8/1/24, 3:05 PM - Milan Edoofa: It truly is, Blessing.

Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 3:28 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I have decided to spend more time with my family and friends learn a lot of skills from the people around me, commence my bachelor's,meet new friends and learn other cultures moreso helping other students get into Edoofa scholarship program
8/1/24, 3:37 PM - Milan Edoofa: That is so great, Blessing! Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 3:37 PM - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 71 438 0324: I was at school and we weren't allowed phones there,yes now it's the right time for me to focus on my university admission journey
8/1/24, 4:34 PM - Milan Edoofa: That is completely understandable, dear. Schools implement such policies for the benefit of the students, allowing them to concentrate and perform at their best during examinations.

It is great to know that you are now available to take your admission process forward.

I would like to schedule a detailed conversation regarding the same for tomorrow. Would you be available at 9:00 AM tomorrow? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 4:52 PM - +263 71 438 0324: Yes I will
8/1/24, 5:07 PM - Milan Edoofa: Alright Blessing. I will connect with you tomorrow. Till then, take care and have a good night!
