5/1/24, 4:31 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. I can also see that you have seen my messages. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*. It has already been 5 months now.

I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session, or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better. <This message was edited>
5/1/24, 4:35 PM - +263 71 257 6605: Good day sir. Definitely wanted to proceed with the registration but surely things in Zimbabwe have fallen apart. The economy is dysfunctional and raising the required funds is a challenge. Dont know if the situation can be helped.
5/1/24, 7:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: The current situation in Zimbabwe has indeed presented significant challenges, particularly in terms of the economic instability, making it difficult to raise the required funds for the registration. May I know if you have made any plans on regards to the higher education?
5/1/24, 7:02 PM - +263 71 257 6605: Currently am tying to mobilise funds for local colleges
5/1/24, 7:08 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know if you are able to select the university of your choice?
5/1/24, 7:10 PM - +263 71 257 6605: If she scores higher mark will choose university of Zimbabwe as first priority and it is my prayer that there won't be challenges again.
5/1/24, 7:13 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's understandable. Education is crucial, and navigating these challenges showcases your determination.
5/1/24, 7:18 PM - +263 71 257 6605: Thank you so much.
