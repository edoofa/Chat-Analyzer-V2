8/1/24, 2:04 PM - Milan Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 2:04 PM - Milan Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 2:04 PM - Milan Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?

8/1/24, 4:02 PM - Milan Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 4:15 PM - +263 71 488 7380: I am learning new skills as well...I started doing short courses today namely baking, catering, till operation and beauty therapy
8/1/24, 4:25 PM - Milan Edoofa: That is so great, Priviledge!

Absolutely, with learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 4:43 PM - +263 71 488 7380: And i will surely make you proud
8/1/24, 4:56 PM - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, dear. 

Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:07 PM - +263 71 488 7380: It was due to my exams ma'am
8/1/24, 5:08 PM - +263 71 488 7380: We can now continue
8/1/24, 5:11 PM - Milan Edoofa: It is great to know that you are now available to take your admission process forward.

I would like to schedule a detailed conversation regarding the same for tomorrow. Would you be available at 9:00 AM tomorrow?
8/1/24, 5:16 PM - +263 71 488 7380: Unfortunately i have courses in the morning, is it possible to reschedule to 3pm
