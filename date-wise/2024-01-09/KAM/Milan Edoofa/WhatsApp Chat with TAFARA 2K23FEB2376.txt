4/1/24, 1:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
4/1/24, 3:40 PM - +263 77 376 4654: We are fine how are u, compliments of the season
4/1/24, 5:46 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
4/1/24, 5:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
4/1/24, 5:47 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.

This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.
