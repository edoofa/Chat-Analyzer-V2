This transition marks a significant chapter in my life as I will be bidding farewell to the cherished moments at the Admissions Team in Edoofa.

8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tanatswa,

I am *Ms. Siddhi Singh, Admission Officer at Edoofa* and I am honoured to assume the responsibilities previously held by Mr. Shivjeet. I will be guiding you toward realising your dream education with Edoofa. I am confident that together, we can ensure a promising start to your educational journey, leading to the right employment opportunities and ultimately, success for you and your family.
8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Milan Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into your dreams and aspirations to advance your academic career. Upon reviewing your application file, I was both impressed and reassured to assist you in achieving these goals here in India, which will unlock doors to incredible opportunities in the future.
8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Milan Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life. It signifies a significant scientific advancement, laying the groundwork for future progress.
8/1/24, 1:54 PM - Milan Edoofa: This achievement has not only pushed boundaries but also has inspired young minds all over the world to pursue their dreams. On the same note, I wanted to extend my heartiest wishes for the New Year to you and your family and check in to see how you and your family started your year?
8/1/24, 3:15 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Hello Ms Siddhi Singh.l am happy to be on this journey with .

We started 2024 on a good note
8/1/24, 3:16 PM - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Tanatswa.

A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 3:19 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I have decided to claim 2024 as my year making progress in life bringing the most out of me in this new year l will only be chasing my dreams and of course learning new skills
8/1/24, 3:24 PM - Milan Edoofa: That is so good to hear. With learning comes transformative changes that offer the opportunity for personal growth and success, I am looking forward for you to explore all the adventures that lie ahead of you.
8/1/24, 3:24 PM - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 3:27 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Sorry ma'am if l may ask what formalities
8/1/24, 4:01 PM - Milan Edoofa: That's alright, Tanatswa. Let me help you recall.

The last time we were in contact, we successfully completed some aspects of your admission process, including initial formalities such as the Feedback Form, Student Application Form, and preparation of your Statement of Purpose (SOP). However, to progress further in the process and assist you in securing a scholarship seat with the best university for your education, we were supposed to help you obtain your scholarship offer letter to complete university registration formalities. Unfortunately, this was left incomplete, possibly due to your preoccupation with exams. Do you recall the procedures we underwent during that time?
8/1/24, 4:03 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes l remember l did send my statement of purpose and l was told to wait for 3 to 4 days l am not sure and l will receive an e-mail from the college
8/1/24, 4:17 PM - +263 77 328 7663: If l still remember well that was 2022 when l sent it and  when l inquired about not receiving any e-mail from the college they said we will continue with the college admission process next year meaning 2023.
So since then l have been waiting.
8/1/24, 4:17 PM - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
8/1/24, 4:26 PM - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is correct. That was the last stage that was covered. However, after consulting with Mr. Shivjeet he brought to my attention that you had certain concerns with going forward with your application, and that is the reason why you were unable to proceed to the next stage. May I know more about it? <This message was edited>
8/1/24, 4:27 PM - Milan Edoofa: Also Tanatswa, I would like to ask you to help me understand with your 2nd message better? Which college did you email?
8/1/24, 4:28 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I wanted to change my program
8/1/24, 4:30 PM - +263 77 328 7663: I did not e-mail any college rather l was told that a college wilk e-mail me after l sent my SOP I'm sure that is also when l sent a task l was given they were few questions l was supposed to answer
8/1/24, 4:45 PM - Milan Edoofa: Alright. I would like to discuss the same in a detailed conversation tomorrow. Would you be available at 9:00 AM tomorrow?
8/1/24, 4:46 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Yes Ms Siddhi
8/1/24, 4:55 PM - Milan Edoofa: Alright Tanatswa. I will connect with you tomorrow. Till then, take care and have a good night!
8/1/24, 4:59 PM - +263 77 328 7663: Same with you ma'am
