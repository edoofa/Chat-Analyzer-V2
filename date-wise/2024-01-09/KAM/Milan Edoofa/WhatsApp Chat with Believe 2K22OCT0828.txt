8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Milan Edoofa: In the past few days, I had an in-depth discussion with Mr. Shivjeet and had the opportunity to review your scholarship application file in our records.

8/1/24, 2:19 PM - Milan Edoofa: Before we get into the specifics of your admission journey and talk about your admission process, I would like to share an exciting milestone that India as a country achieved within the first week of 2024 – the successful *India's Chandrayaan-3 Engine Test.* This accomplishment is responsible for the third lunar mission, aiming to land a rover on the Moon's south polar region and conduct scientific studies that could check Moon's viability to sustain life.

8/1/24, 3:08 PM - Milan Edoofa: A new year brings forth a multitude of possibilities and fresh opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Though the new year itself may not bring immediate transformation, it marks a symbolic turning point, a chance to reflect and set new goals for ourselves. This year, I have decided to practice more compassion, learn at least one new skill, and assist students who were unable to proceed further with their admission process in 2023, guiding them to build their envisioned future.

May I ask what changes or additions you have decided to make in the year 2024?
8/1/24, 4:19 PM - +263 77 709 8241: It is a wonderful opportunity meeting you, and having you assist me in partaking this academic journey, I'm so much honored knowing you are here to guide me accordingly. 

I stand firm with my goals and have my eyes set on my university education.

8/1/24, 5:01 PM - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would like to shift focus to your admission process. As per your application file, it seems that you were unable to proceed with your admission formalities scheduled for August 2024. Since a few months have passed, and this is our first interaction, I would like to inquire why you were unable to do so and if now is the right time for you to focus on your university admission journey for higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 5:34 PM - +263 77 709 8241: Due to the October examinations I could not handle both the examination pressure and processes online, hence I took a break from my social media platforms. Now as I await the announcement of my results, I decided to continue with the admission process
