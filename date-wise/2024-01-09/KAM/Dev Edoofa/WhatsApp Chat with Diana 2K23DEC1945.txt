3/1/24, 10:17 AM - Dev Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
3/1/24, 10:20 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Yes we may start

3/1/24, 11:10 AM - +263 78 129 0541: l have noticed it thank you sir
3/1/24, 11:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
3/1/24, 11:12 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
3/1/24, 11:14 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Noted and very understood
3/1/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
3/1/24, 11:18 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
3/1/24, 11:20 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Yes sir lm following and lm understanding
3/1/24, 11:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
3/1/24, 11:25 AM - Dev Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

3/1/24, 11:29 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
3/1/24, 11:36 AM - Dev Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them.

5/1/24, 8:42 AM - Dev Edoofa: So shall we start with our session?
5/1/24, 8:42 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Yes sir
5/1/24, 8:51 AM - Dev Edoofa: That is good to know.
5/1/24, 8:52 AM - Dev Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (5th January), i.e. today.
5/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Sir am l supposed to carry my phone at school inorder to do the EWYL program
5/1/24, 8:53 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Ok sir  thank you
5/1/24, 8:55 AM - Dev Edoofa: If you are allowed to carry your phone to the school, then you may proceed with it. But if not, your parents/guardians can take part in the EWYL sessions, so that your journey with Edoofa is not hindered
5/1/24, 8:56 AM - Dev Edoofa: I hope you are clear with this?
5/1/24, 8:57 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Ok sir but isn't it wise to ask permission from the head to bring a phone so that l can be able to know EWYL program well
5/1/24, 9:00 AM - Dev Edoofa: Yes, Diana. It is wise to ask permission from the head regarding this, but schools have strict policies on electronics as it can be source of distraction for students in the school. So, this plea has a high chance of getting rejected.
I hope you understand.
5/1/24, 9:02 AM - +263 78 129 0541: Yes sir I understand thank you l think my parents will continue with the sessions once l go back to school

8/1/24, 10:50 AM - Dev Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope all of you had a wonderful weekend and are completely ready for this week.
I have taken note of this Diana and I wish you to have an excellent semester at school.
So, if we are ready to proceed with the admission process, shall we start with our session for today?
8/1/24, 11:27 AM - +263 77 338 9207: Good morning Mr Dev.Diana has left for school.I am a bit tide up at the moment with work. We can commence at 1300 hours in the afternoon if possible
8/1/24, 12:38 PM - Dev Edoofa: I understand Mr. Zhou. I wish Diana best of my wishes for the semester and hope she will excel in her studies at school.
8/1/24, 12:39 PM - Dev Edoofa: We will have our session at 1:00pm today.
8/1/24, 1:03 PM - +263 77 338 9207: We also wish her the best.
8/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 338 9207: Its ok we can as well start at that time.
8/1/24, 1:04 PM - Dev Edoofa: Let us start with our session, Mr. Zhou.
8/1/24, 1:04 PM - +263 77 338 9207: Its okay.
8/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our experience of over 14 years and having assisted over 5000 students from different countries, we have realized that financial planning is the most important factor when a student plans for his/her higher education abroad.
8/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am sure that you must be aware that 20-30% of students who are admitted into universities abroad are unable to fulfill their dream and come to India due to a lack of financial planning. The funds needed for booking flights, accommodation, and covering living expenses after arrival often become overwhelming, leading to the decision to defer their admission for a year. This, in turn, creates a gap in the child's education.
8/1/24, 1:06 PM - Dev Edoofa: To assist both students and parents in this regard, Edoofa Management has designed a Financial Secure Plan that aims to help you prepare for your higher educational finances without experiencing stress or last-minute rushes. I believe you must be wondering about the details of the same plan and how it helps the parents?
8/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 77 338 9207: Definitely. We would like to thank Edoofa for this extended assistance.
8/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: We are delighted to know that!
8/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.
8/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.
8/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.
8/1/24, 1:14 PM - Dev Edoofa: *Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.
8/1/24, 1:15 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, when you go through all the above benefits, I am sure you can see that the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan is an important financial tool for parents/students who are supposed to enter the university soon. 

It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship. Isn't this something you and your family also wish to have?
8/1/24, 1:21 PM - +263 77 338 9207: The fact that Edoofa is proactive in all its plans assist us greatly.
8/1/24, 1:22 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through the above points, do you want me to help you understand how the Edoofa Secure Plan works?
8/1/24, 1:24 PM - +263 77 338 9207: You can go ahead sir.
8/1/24, 1:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as you are aware, we are currently in January 2024, and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for your finances before you start your university education in 2025.
8/1/24, 1:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: During the counseling session, you were informed that at Edoofa, we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees. Hence, the cost of education, including food and accommodation after the scholarship, would be between $2000-$3000, and it could be even less. Not more than that.
8/1/24, 1:25 PM - Dev Edoofa: This means that if you can save $150 per month for the next 20 months, you will be able to save $3000. This amount is more than enough for the first year of university fees, including tuition fees (if any), food, and accommodation. I hope you agree with this?
8/1/24, 1:27 PM - +263 77 338 9207: I definitely agree.
8/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Right, this means that by the time you would be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first-year fee.
8/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, in these next 20 months, I am sure you would also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if you secure a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years are already secured.
8/1/24, 1:30 PM - Dev Edoofa: Now, for a 3-year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 years, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent will be easy and smooth. I believe you must be able to see this perspective?
8/1/24, 1:32 PM - +263 77 338 9207: The interpretation is very clear and as such the perspective is visible.
8/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
8/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
8/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
8/1/24, 1:33 PM - Dev Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
8/1/24, 1:37 PM - +263 77 338 9207: The nostro is already available.My son has visa card for the payment.
8/1/24, 1:38 PM - +263 77 338 9207: I mean nostro account.
8/1/24, 9:12 PM - Dev Edoofa: Thank you Mr.Zhou for informing. I have taken note of it, but I was just conveying it as one of the examples of some constraints that usually others face in Zimbabwe. I hope you understand.

We will resume our session at 12pm tomorrow to discuss the Edoofa Finacial Secure Plan in detail. Wish you a blessed night!
8/1/24, 10:31 PM - +263 77 338 9207: Understood. Its okay.
