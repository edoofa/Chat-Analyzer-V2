6/1/24, 12:41 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!!
7/1/24, 12:38 PM - Aditi Edoofa: Hello Parents @263715507792 @263774390175 

If you would have been following our messages, you might have come across to read about *SLICE-CON'24 (Symposium of Leaders, Inventors, and Creators with Edoofa) – an Industrial Visit* curated especially for our students next week. 

The visit is one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect with industry specialists, engage in workshops with CEOs, founders, and co-founders – an experience that goes beyond the classroom.
And here's the exciting part – *it's a fully funded event by Edoofa, ensuring your child's comfort from food to travel to stay.*

Your child has shared the confirmation to the official invitation that was sent from our end. Were you aware of the same and what do you think about this?
7/1/24, 2:22 PM - +263 71 550 7792: Good day @919625219934, indeed we have been following the messages regarding this industrial visit on the 9th of January. It is a privilege for Cleopatra to be part of this visit as it exposes her to latest industrial trends in the early stages of her undergraduate studies.

Of particular note are the conference speakers who are relatively young and are already entrepreneurs in their own right, with titles of "Founder & CEO". This shoud give Cleopatra more enthusiasm to aim higher in life.

We also note that our own Zimbabwean ambassador to India H.E Dr. Godfrey Majoni Chipare is also a guest speaker. We know he will impart valuable knowledge to Cleopatra and her colleagues studying in India.

We wish the SLICE- CON'24 a success.
