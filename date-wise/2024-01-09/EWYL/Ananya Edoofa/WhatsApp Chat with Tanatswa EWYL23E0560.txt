22/12/23, 4:06 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, however since our session time is over, we will connect in our next session which is on Tuesday. Meanwhile, start connecting with other students as well. Use social media, and try connecting with your school juniors to widen your community for the second project! Start exploring and working so that you can submit at least 2 application forms with me by tomorrow! Utilize the weekend. Now, let us conclude our session here, and we shall reconnect on Tuesday. Make sure to follow your EWYL ritual tomorrow, as I will be sharing your weekend activity.

5/1/24, 1:11 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Tanatswa!

I'm disappointed to see that you missed today's session. It's crucial to be responsible and attend on time. A lack of punctuality affects not just your progress but also the overall effectiveness of our mentoring. Let's take this seriously, and I expect better attendance in the future. Punctuality is a non-negotiable part of our commitment. Ensure you're on time for our next session.
5/1/24, 1:34 PM - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am. I am sorry for missing my session.
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening!

I wanted to share some exciting news with all of you. As you may have noticed, my schedule has been quite packed lately due to work commitments. The reason behind this is something truly special – our team has organized a three-day long industrial visit called SLICE CON' 24 for our Indian Edoofians! 🚀

During this event, we are fortunate to have the Co-founders and CEOs of prominent brands who will be present and sharing their invaluable experiences in one-on-one sessions. Yes, you read that right – they will be there live, right in front of us! What's even more thrilling is that a few of our students are presenting a presentation directly to these CEOs, showcasing why Africa, your homeland, is the best market for their products. 🤝
7/1/24, 8:48 PM - Ananya Edoofa: While I am filled with excitement for this event, please note that due to my involvement in the visit on the 8th, 9th, and 10th of January, our regular sessions won't be taking place on these days. When we connect on the 11th of January, I'll share my students' experiences and pictures with you. 📸✨
8/1/24, 9:02 PM - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am. That would be delightful indeed
