On a very emotional, happy, and jolly note, I am happy to announce that it's time to roll up for our Christmas celebrations🎄. From tomorrow until Monday, our entire team will also be immersed in the festivities, celebrating this time with our families. 

I, your proud mentor, Ms. Saloni, want to wish you a Merry Christmas🎁. It would have been amazing if I were there with you in person, but I sincerely wish you all the happiness, love, joy, and cozy family time, and, yes, may all your wishes come true, just like mine did by having you as my wonderful student🥺♥️

Happy holidays! I am sure you are going to make the most of this time. 

And, wait, don't forget to share pictures of your celebration with me. 📸
