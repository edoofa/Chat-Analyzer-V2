I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
18/12/23, 2:29 pm - Gurvinder added +263 77 837 3731
18/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Good afternoon Sir
18/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Mrs Mpofu,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Noted Sir Gurvinder
18/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Good afternoon everyone
18/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs Mpofu, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Donavan, is that correct?
18/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes
18/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Donavan, also do tell me whether you learnt about Donavan’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
18/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 297 5426: We only got a link and we applied through Donavan
18/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 297 5426: My daughter went to school with him and they were in the same class
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
18/12/23, 3:13 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
18/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
18/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
18/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
18/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
18/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes my daughter is looking for this opportunity
18/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 297 5426: And thank you for introducing us to this program
18/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Mpofu, as we start your daughter's counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
18/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 837 3731: Good afternoon 
I have read and understood what you are saying.
18/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I will try my best
18/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I think I do
18/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Network is a bit slow this side
18/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 837 3731: Which courses are offered and at which university

19/12/23, 9:54 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Sc. Agriculture*
19/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 71 297 5426: Yes
19/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 71 297 5426: Good morning Mr Gurvinder this is Nicole
19/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
19/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
19/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 297 5426: This is Nicole I am confident
19/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: That is great, So shall I brief you about the program?
19/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes Sir

Agriculture* involves the study of agricultural sciences and the use of modern scientific equipment and techniques in agriculture, land surveying, soil science, water resource management, animal, and poultry management, basics of biotechnology etc. The objective of the course is to use these concepts to train students to improve agricultural productivity.  B.Sc. Agriculture Syllabus includes subjects such as Agronomy, Plant Biochemistry, Water Management Engineering, Study of Pests and Crops, amongst many others. The syllabus is designed to provide an overall knowledge of agriculture and all its related disciplines.
19/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: B.Sc. Agriculture graduates can find jobs in both the public and private sectors.

19/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
19/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 837 3731: Yes sending now
19/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 297 5426: If l do get the opportunity to study the course that in the next five years l see my self in working hard to improve the ways of production.As an agronomist I would use my knowledge and skills to help farmers grow healthy and sustainable crops.l would also get to research new ways to improve crop yields.And perhaps most importantly I get to see the tangible results of my work in the form of abundant health crops and people getting to have crops that are healthy for them and contains enough nutrients for them <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Nicole, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
19/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes I am
19/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
19/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 297 5426: If l study abroad l would have more a global network of contacts and many provided opportunities for future career growth <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 3:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
19/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I could work with local educators to incorporate elements of my study abroad experience into the curriculum, such as by adding new perspective on world issues.
I could also share all my experiences with students and teachers back home to give them a first hand account of the things I learnt
19/12/23, 4:13 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Nicole, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
19/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I do
19/12/23, 4:18 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
19/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes
19/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I always thought all countries that share the same history as India were considered to have lower education
19/12/23, 8:42 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 8:41 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

20/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 71 297 5426: This is amazing
20/12/23, 11:27 am - Gurvinder: So now Nicole, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
20/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 297 5426: No
20/12/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
20/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 837 3731: Yes I have
20/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Good morning. Am not sure of the amount but I know it's expensive
20/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
20/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 1:02 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 297 5426: With EDOOFA its less expensive
20/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 297 5426: So how do the students  reduce their remaining annual fee
20/12/23, 1:37 pm - Gurvinder: For that shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
20/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Ok Sir
20/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Nicole, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I understand
20/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

20/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I think I will benefit from all of this given the opportunity.
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I will try my best to follow all the steps and work extra hard
20/12/23, 3:15 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Nicole, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 297 5426: So if I work extra hard and earn more it means my mother will pay less
20/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
20/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/12/23, 3:29 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
20/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 297 5426: This is amazing and exciting
20/12/23, 3:39 pm - +263 71 297 5426: These certificates prove that hard work pays if I get the opportunity I will give it my all <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 3:48 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Nicole, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
20/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes Sir my family will be supporting me
20/12/23, 4:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
20/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 297 5426: My mother knows that I wish to study abroad. When I applied I was hoping to get a chance to study abroad with the hope of getting financial assistance
20/12/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes
20/12/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: Nicole as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 4:45 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Around $1500-$2250
20/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Nicole, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 4:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 297 5426: It's affordable
20/12/23, 4:48 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 4:52 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I do
20/12/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: Nicole basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/12/23, 4:54 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
20/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 297 5426: I understand
20/12/23, 5:00 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
20/12/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 297 5426: No Sir
20/12/23, 5:04 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 5:04 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Nicole, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
20/12/23, 5:04 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/12/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 297 5426: Yes I do
20/12/23, 5:10 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/12/23, 5:10 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
20/12/23, 5:10 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
20/12/23, 5:10 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
20/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 297 5426: No questions sir
20/12/23, 5:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
20/12/23, 5:14 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/12/23, 5:15 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
