*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kelvin ?*
20/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 195 0427: 1)Well what motivated me to apply for the schoolarship program firstly was the Edoofa schoolarship program covering 50-80% of all expenses for my stay and learning in Indian and secondly quality education that statistics has shown is very high in India with a lot of diverse opportunities for success and lastly am a huge fan of the Indian culture and traditions so this came as an opportunity for me to learn more about the nation 

2)*The Edoofa Scholarship Program* 

▫️The Edoofa Scholarship Program is a transformative initiative aimed at providing *Quality International Tertiary* Education to deserving students, particularly from Africa. 
▫️Managed by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions* Pvt. Ltd. founded by *Mr.Angad and Mr.Avreen Singh* , the program addresses the challenges of both *affordability* and *employability* that many students face in pursuing tertiary education.
•Key Features of the Edoofa Scholarship Program

•Imagine having the opportunity to pursue your dream education without the burden of very high tuition fees. 
•Edoofa provides scholarships covering 50-80% of tuition costs, ensuring that financial constraints don't stand between you and a Quality International Education.
Studying in India without the scholarship granted by Edoofa is way too expensive and may cost around $7000-$8000 per year
But once I saw that with the Edoofa schoolarship program I would need a range of *$2000-$3000* per year including all academic and living expenses.
•Through the Earn While You Learn Program, Edoofa gives you the opportunity to alleviate the financial burden even more, by participating in online projects and earning scholarship credits <This message was edited>
