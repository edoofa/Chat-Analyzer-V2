I am *Ms. Pallika*, and am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Austin*, our Senior Career Counsellor, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *10:00 AM CAT tomorrow (04/10/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

I hope you all are doing fine.

We have been expecting your responses and participation in the session.
Since we are experiencing a rush of applicants, we wish that no deserving candidate misses the opportunity
So, if you are unwilling to continue, we will be revoking your application by the end of tomorrow *(13/10/2023)* and allotting your slot to the next applicant.

In case you wish to proceed with the program, make sure to notify the group at the earliest so that I can guide you ahead

Stay blessed!
