17/10/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 414 6201: Yes
17/10/23, 8:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome to the session, Kamambo , It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Abigail ?*
17/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 414 6201: What motivated me to apply for the Edoofa scholarship program was this
Since I was young it was my dream to study abroad and attain high quality education from abroad and when I heard about Edoofa then I applied to Abigail Bidi though I was scared of being scammed until she shared about her experience with Edoofa scholarship program. After she shared her experience I developed great interest and decided to go ahead with Edoofa and I have great hope that Edoofa scholarship program will help me to fulfill my dream
17/10/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 414 6201: *The Edoofa Program*  

• Edoofa is an Educational program which firmly focuses on *Quality Higher Education* that *leads to*
*employment.* 
As we see with the changing times & ever-increasing penetration of internet, there is an 
increasing demand by employers for new age skills and experience along with college degrees 
from the students.
Edoofa has, *over the last 10 years* , been recognised  as the premier institution to focus on this 
area by becoming employability partners of Government Recognized Top Indian 
Colleges/Universities.

• To be able to positively impact the lives of more and more students, Apart from the menace 
of *lack of employability* within the students, Edoofa has recognized another problem that it 
wants to solve. 
The problem pertains to the *lack of affordability* that is currently affecting millions 
of students who struggle to get higher education each year.

• Therefore, Edoofa has created *a unique opportunity* by taking over the seats in various universities and colleges 
(under State Government universities for example, The Punjab Technical University, Uttarakhand Technical 
University & UPTU) in India and created a *scholarship fund* that helps its enrolled students get 
a *highly accredited college degree* with a scholarship while at the same time get trained for jobs 
and employment opportunities under the Edoofa program.

The *Vision* that Edoofa has for the enrolled students before they graduate is to *impart them with the relevant* 
*knowledge, skills and attitude.*

• Through the Edoofa program, the students are learning the right 
attitude of *hard work and passion, gaining crucial*
*employability skills and getting precious* 
*knowledge* with a *quality academic experience.*
17/10/23, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Kamambo, Thank you for sharing about this, and also I can see you are well-motivated. Please let me add more information to it.

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/10/23, 9:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program.

17/10/23, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 1:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
17/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 414 6201: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 414 6201: I didn't apply to any of the Universities or researched but to my understanding foreign education helps me by learning while earning and there is a high probability of employment once you're done or obtained your Diploma or Degree
17/10/23, 2:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I understand! 


Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

25/10/23, 9:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Kamambo, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by DAY, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
