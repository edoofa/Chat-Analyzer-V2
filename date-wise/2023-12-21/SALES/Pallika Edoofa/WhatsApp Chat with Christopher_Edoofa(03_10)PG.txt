So, it is difficult for me to connect with you at that time, kindly provide me a convenient time for tomorrow so that we can connect and discuss further if you are unavailable at present.
04/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 73 647 3371: Sorry, was unaware
04/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 73 647 3371: If you are available we can do now. If you don't mind
04/10/23, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Christopher, Before commencing the discussion, Please note that as per the protocols of the program, the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary for the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*
In case they are not available right now, they can still be part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
04/10/23, 3:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So I am making you the group admin. Please add them and let me know the names with which I should address them
