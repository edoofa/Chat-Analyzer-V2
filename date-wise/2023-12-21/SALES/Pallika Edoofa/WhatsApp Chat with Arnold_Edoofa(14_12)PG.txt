15/12/23, 7:49 am - +263 77 268 6147: Good morning Edoofa team,my name is Herbert Mutanda a father to Arnold.

I have gone through your discussion With my son on various areas.He answered you very well but there are some areas which I need to revisit.

You noted that you offer 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees which is very commendable. Arnold has 3  other siblings who need to be taken care of back home,as a result given the the scenario of Zimbabwe's economic situation,I don't think as parents of Arnold we will manage transport and living costs based on our earnings.

I suggest if you have a special package for those who are less privileged,you may help by adding his name on that list.

On the issue of tuition fees,you only mentioned that you offer 50-100% but I don't know the actual tuition fees I have to pay on top of your provision.

Thank you.
15/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 78 495 8058: Good afternoon

15/12/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges Mr Herbert and we will be discussing all the aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program in detail in this session where I will also be guiding you through the cost of education.
15/12/23, 1:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?

19/12/23, 9:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Arnold, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
19/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 495 8058: oky i understand this is Great... i wanted to add Communication skills to my combination... an Arts subjesct twhich is compulsory

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
