20/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what drew you towards this peculiar domain, please?
20/12/23, 4:33 pm - +260 96 1494666: The way my teacher always talked about how Zambia has to rely on other countries for them to provide help to them instead of being independent and also tge way patients suffer due to lack of medicine in hospitals

20/12/23, 4:47 pm - +260 96 1494666: But if there is a way in which chemical engineering can be put with pharmacy then I think I can do it
