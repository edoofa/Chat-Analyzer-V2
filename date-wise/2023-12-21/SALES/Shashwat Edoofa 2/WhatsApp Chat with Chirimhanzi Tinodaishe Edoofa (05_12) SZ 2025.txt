Basically, your educational qualifications, Achievements, the name of your school, your ambitions, your interests and hobbies, your parent's highest qualification and present profession, and a detailed description of your family background.
05/12/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Hello, my name is Tinodaishe Chirimhanzi. I'm aged 17 and im currently pursuing my education at St Faith's with the hope of finishing of my education with the help of Edoofa. During my educational journey I have passed my ordinary level examinations which gave me a chance to continue my dream. I have been exceptional in clubing activities. I am someone who loves giving back to the society which is the reason why I joined the LEO club which helps me grow mentally. I normally spend my free time reading novels about great people as I wish to write my own someday talking about my journey to success. I also play basketball and I love rugby but I haven't had the opportunity to play it yet. I have this dream of becoming a great civil engineer one day who will be recognized internationally. I also plan on later opening my own construction company and if everything goes on I will later build a children's home which I will help by sponsoring their education. I live in a family of three kids and with my parents. I am the second born child with an older sister and a younger brother. My mother is an engineer and and has recently completed Master in technology in Machine design at Harare institute of technology.
My father is a Technical sales Representative at Africa steel, he is a qualified fitter and turner.With the current situation here in Zimbabwe its getting hard for my parents to pay for the tuition of three kids so this scholarship will be a great opportunity to me and it will have really helped me and them. We live in a cottage which has 3 rooms. My parents travel to work by public transport. <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 3:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! The combination of athletics and academics is indeed exquisite. I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Tinodaishe. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. You are truly an inspiring individual with a passion for making a positive impact on society. Your involvement in the LEO club reflects your commitment to personal growth and community service, showcasing a commendable dedication to giving back. The combination of your interests, from reading novels about great people to playing basketball and aspiring to play rugby, paints a picture of a well-rounded and ambitious individual. Your dream of becoming a renowned civil engineer with international recognition and the future goal of opening a construction company and supporting a children's home through education sponsorship are not just aspirations but a testament to your vision for a brighter and more compassionate future! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?
05/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 962 3537: My mother is an engineer and and has recently completed Master in technology in Machine design at Harare institute of technology.
My father is a Technical sales Representative at Africa steel, he is a qualified fitter and turner. He has also a degree in Marketing (imm South Africa)
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your parents are an incredible duo, each contributing significantly to the professional landscape. Mrs. Gerry's achievement of completing a Master's in Technology in Machine Design at Harare Institute of Technology showcases her dedication to advancing in her field of engineering. Meanwhile, Mr. Livingstone, a qualified fitter and turner with a degree in Marketing from IMM South Africa, demonstrates a versatile skill set, combining technical expertise with sales acumen!
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly shed light on the educational background of your siblings?
05/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 71 962 3537: My sister is currently pursuing her degree in Electrical engineering and my brother is still in grade 3.
05/12/23, 4:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Tinodaishe. So, could you kindly tell me how much *St Faiths High School* charges you every term, and who in your family financially supports your education?
05/12/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 962 3537: For this past term and second term the fees was 400 US dollars but it has increased to 600 US dollars. Both my parents help each other to raise the money to support my education
05/12/23, 5:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
05/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 71 962 3537: If I am able get the scholarship my parents will assist each other in supporting my education abroad.
05/12/23, 7:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Livingstone and Mrs. Gerry are extraordinary parents, consistently providing unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement, and their dedication to your well-being is truly admirable!
05/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Yes they are without them I wouldn't be here
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with your course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad. Also please share pictures of your previous qualifications results for evaluation. Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
05/12/23, 9:10 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Studying abroad would be a dream come true for me and my family. The current situation in Zimbabwe makes learning here useless if you don't have the links to those at top. Secondly studying abroad gives me exposure to different working and learning conditions even socially too, as I will be improving my socializing skills. After studying abroad I wish to come and start my business here and I would have made the connections with those abroad who will help me grow internationally.
05/12/23, 9:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Tinodaishe! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
05/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 962 3537: That's right
05/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Thank you

05/12/23, 10:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Tinodaishe. I must say that you have obtained impeccable grades!
05/12/23, 10:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
05/12/23, 10:04 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Thank you but I'm aiming for 15 points
05/12/23, 10:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
05/12/23, 10:05 pm - +263 71 962 3537: With the correct work input it's achievable
05/12/23, 10:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colours, Tinodaishe!
05/12/23, 10:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
05/12/23, 10:10 pm - +263 71 962 3537: As I mentioned before I want to do Civil engineers. What has really drove me to this occupation is the subjects I do. I have evaluated my options and figured it was the best choice.
05/12/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 962 3537: It's a really cool program and what really fascinates me about is that you spend most of the time out in the field rather than sitting in offices and I am a person who love nature. I want to be known for designing something great on earth

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 962 3537: Good morning
06/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 962 3537: Yes I am
06/12/23, 9:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tinodaishe!
06/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Tinodaishe, could you please share why you didn't pursue Chemistry in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it?
06/12/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 962 3537: It is an important subject but with the path I want to take it's not as important because what's really necessary if you are to do engineering is Maths and Physics.
06/12/23, 9:28 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study *Mechanical Engineering* / *Civil Engineering* then they should have *Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics* in their A level mandatorily.
06/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 962 3537: Unfortunately I didn't do enough research. So with my combination there's no chance of me getting the scholarship?
06/12/23, 9:56 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews! Could you kindly delve into your career aspirations, please?
06/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 962 3537: During my career I wish to aquire some skills and to meet my aspirations 

1. **Project Management**:As a civil engineers I aspire to become a projects manager, lead teams and oversee the planning, design, and construction of infrastructure projects.

2. **Design Engineering**: I am also passionate about the design aspect of my  work and aspire to specialize in areas such as structural design, transportation engineering, or water resources engineering.

3. **Construction Management**: I also plan on moving  into construction management, overseeing the actual building and implementation of infrastructure projects.

4. **Entrepreneurship**: I also have the ambition of starting my own engineering firms, offering specialized services or innovative solutions to infrastructure challenges.

Lastly I also wish to start my own construction company.

The trust and support garnered from interactions with Indian business tycoons can be instrumental in shaping your journey to the top, ensuring a successful and fulfilling career in software engineering! I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
16/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 962 3537: No I'm not familiar with it.
16/12/23, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tinodaishe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
16/12/23, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 10:54 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
16/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 962 3537: Yes I think my parents can work to get that
16/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 71 962 3537: So is the money paid one time or?
16/12/23, 11:15 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. This cost is paid in two equal installments. Each installment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters in a year.
16/12/23, 11:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
16/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 962 3537: The opportunity to work is a good one. That way I get to help my parents and earn experience too.
16/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 962 3537: No I don't, enlighten me please
16/12/23, 12:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/12/23, 12:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
16/12/23, 12:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
16/12/23, 12:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
16/12/23, 12:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Honestly I think that the EWYL is a very big opportunity for an aspiring student. It gives me a chance to have insight on what I will be doing after I complete the degree and it also introduces me to the game earlier. When I finish my degree I will be an expert in my industry, so yes I think this will be very beneficial to me.
16/12/23, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
16/12/23, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
16/12/23, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
16/12/23, 12:54 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

16/12/23, 4:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please let me know.
16/12/23, 5:57 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Sorry I was out of power
16/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Yes I do realize. The harder one works the more credits they get

18/12/23, 9:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 962 3537: Good morning sir
18/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 962 3537: I am ready
18/12/23, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tinodaishe!
18/12/23, 9:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
18/12/23, 9:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
18/12/23, 9:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
18/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 962 3537: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 71 962 3537: Honestly speaking all points are really good. I appreciate all of them because they all contribute in one's growth
18/12/23, 10:08 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Tinodaishe! May I know which one is your favourite, please?
18/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 962 3537: Point number 2 sir
18/12/23, 10:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
18/12/23, 10:43 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
18/12/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 962 3537: It's what they want. In Zimbabwe there's nothing so they would be happy if I got it
18/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
18/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
18/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Yes that's basically it
18/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 71 962 3537: I would also need visas and all
18/12/23, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
18/12/23, 1:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
18/12/23, 2:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 2:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
18/12/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 962 3537: So you get to pay $350 if you get the scholarship before 30 December
18/12/23, 2:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Chirimhanzi Tinodaishe Edoofa (05/12) SZ" to "Chirimhanzi Tinodaishe Edoofa (05/12) SZ 2025"
18/12/23, 2:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
18/12/23, 2:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
18/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Okay
18/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 962 3537: So how long does it take to complete all three phases
18/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tinodaishe, I will brief you regarding every piece of information as the session progresses.
18/12/23, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
18/12/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Basically Edoofa's application process is affordable considering the opportunity the student is given a chance  to raise money to start. Edoofa always gives a good time space for one to make the payments which is good because one can have more time to arrange for the money. The Edoofa's team helps a student with the Earn While You Learn program which raises money and if one works very hard he or she can pay for themselves.  Edoofa payment policy is really good
18/12/23, 8:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

18/12/23, 8:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
18/12/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 962 3537: I think we haved completed the first phase and we are now at the second
18/12/23, 8:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
18/12/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 962 3537: Sure sir
18/12/23, 9:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

18/12/23, 9:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
18/12/23, 9:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

18/12/23, 10:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Tinodaishe!
18/12/23, 10:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

19/12/23, 10:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
