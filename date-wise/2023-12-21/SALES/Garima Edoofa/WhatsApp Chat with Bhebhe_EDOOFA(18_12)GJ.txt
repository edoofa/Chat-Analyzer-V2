19/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 78 194 5870: A schoolarship that covers all my travelling  expenses , accomodation and fees
19/12/23, 10:36 am - Garima Edoofa: Has anyone in your family or in your known circle got a fully funded scholarship?
19/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 194 5870: In my family its a no but my friend got one to Australia
19/12/23, 10:39 am - Garima Edoofa: May I know which scholarship? And why didn't you apply for the same?
19/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 194 5870: I didnt get much of the information because i was not interested in studying in Other countries besides India due to safety reasons ...I have not heard any stories of human trafficking in India , so this on its own say a lot about India and its safety for everyone
19/12/23, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you said it was fully funded scholarship do you know what all things were covered? Or it was a scholarship or sponsorship and what according to your research is the criteria for such scholarship?
19/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 194 5870: Was told that everything was covered and it was a schoorlarship
19/12/23, 10:55 am - Garima Edoofa: what according to your research is the criteria for such scholarship?
19/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 194 5870: I dont have much information on this one
19/12/23, 10:58 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand Ashley.
19/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 194 5870: Thank you maam
19/12/23, 10:58 am - Garima Edoofa: Let me help you understand the criteria
19/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 78 194 5870: Okay
19/12/23, 10:59 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship.
19/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 194 5870: Thank you maam ...I now understand
19/12/23, 11:02 am - Garima Edoofa: You're welcome, Ashley.
19/12/23, 11:03 am - Garima Edoofa: let me explain to you that two kinds of programs provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
19/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 194 5870: Well understood maam
19/12/23, 11:08 am - Garima Edoofa: Moving on, Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
19/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 78 194 5870: Okay
19/12/23, 11:08 am - Garima Edoofa: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.



Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/12/23, 11:09 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 11:09 am - Garima Edoofa: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 194 5870: Wow , this is amazing🤩🤩
19/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 194 5870: Well Understood maam
19/12/23, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Ashley what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
19/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 194 5870: Well understood maam
19/12/23, 11:17 am - Garima Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, however, it is my lunch break and we'll be connecting shortly after 45 minutes.
19/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 194 5870: Okay maam
19/12/23, 12:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: Well, Ashley would you please share your understanding for the same.
19/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 194 5870: I understood that Edoofa Schoorlarships makes it easy for its enrolled students by reducing their education expenses , it  does not provide spoonsorship but it cut costs for international students making learning fun for them
19/12/23, 12:21 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is correct Ashley.
19/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Thank you maam
19/12/23, 12:22 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
19/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Yes maam
19/12/23, 12:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/12/23, 12:26 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/12/23, 12:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.


1. *Projects with Brands and Companies*: -

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics




3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

19/12/23, 12:29 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
19/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Noted
19/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 194 5870: i think this will also be beneficiary to me
19/12/23, 12:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: Yes please, it will surely be beneficial for you.
19/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Thats true
19/12/23, 12:34 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 194 5870: understood👏
19/12/23, 12:41 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/12/23, 12:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, few facts that you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses, which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
 
 
3.     Earn While You Learn: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
19/12/23, 12:59 pm - Garima Edoofa: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
19/12/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Point number 3 : Earn while you learn
19/12/23, 1:24 pm - Garima Edoofa: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.


Alright Ashley, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
19/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 194 5870: At the moment my family is not financially stable i hope they will be able to support me financially
19/12/23, 1:58 pm - Garima Edoofa: Ashley I want you to take today's time and discuss about the EWYL program with you family. As through EWYL students cater their own annual fee.
19/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Okay maam
19/12/23, 2:03 pm - Garima Edoofa: As you see in this video, we have presistance his family was also not financially strong but he was so confident in himself that he can cater his own education through EWYL program.
19/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Yaa true maam
19/12/23, 2:06 pm - Garima Edoofa: Exactly Ashley in the same way you can also do.
19/12/23, 2:07 pm - Garima Edoofa: Alright Ashley as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 2:35 pm - Garima Edoofa: Are we still connected Ashley?
19/12/23, 4:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
19/12/23, 4:12 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
19/12/23, 4:17 pm - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 194 5870: Noted maam
20/12/23, 8:58 am - Garima Edoofa: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/12/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 194 5870: Morning maam ...We can proceed
20/12/23, 9:00 am - +263 78 194 5870: How many hours will our discussion take maam , im doing part time job so i cannot be online for too long👏
20/12/23, 9:04 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand Ashley.
20/12/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 194 5870: Thank you maam
20/12/23, 9:05 am - Garima Edoofa: Ashley, have you discussed this with your parents?
20/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 78 194 5870: Yes maam ....They are okay with it , they only want to know when you guys will start enrolling so that they start looking for the money to support me
20/12/23, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: Can your parents come active so that they can also share what they have understood from yesterday's discussion?
20/12/23, 9:18 am - Garima Edoofa: And if there is any question I will be more than happy to answer that.
20/12/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 194 5870: unfortunately they cant be active online now due to work issues maam
20/12/23, 9:24 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand Ashley.
20/12/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 194 5870: Thank you maam
20/12/23, 9:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Would it be possible for them to share a voice note stating what was the discussion about and what they have understood along with that they are ready to support you financially?
20/12/23, 9:27 am - Garima Edoofa: They can share the voice notes when they are back from work.
20/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 194 5870: Ill talk to them once they are free and they will record maam
20/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 194 5870: Okay maam
20/12/23, 9:28 am - Garima Edoofa: Alright Ashley now that we have covered everything from the counseling session, let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that, you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
20/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 194 5870: Yes maam im ready
20/12/23, 9:38 am - Garima Edoofa: Ashley as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying to multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 194 5870: Noted maam ...More than thousands of dollars
20/12/23, 9:48 am - Garima Edoofa: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/12/23, 9:49 am - Garima Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 194 5870: True maam
20/12/23, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/12/23, 9:54 am - Garima Edoofa: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
20/12/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 194 5870: Still downloading
20/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 194 5870: I do maam
20/12/23, 10:00 am - Garima Edoofa: I understand.
20/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 194 5870: 🙏
20/12/23, 10:00 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 194 5870: Okay maam
20/12/23, 10:15 am - Garima Edoofa: Ashley basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/12/23, 10:15 am - Garima Edoofa: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

20/12/23, 11:21 am - Garima Edoofa: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
