19/12/23, 8:43 am - +265 987 57 92 74: Morning
19/12/23, 8:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright,  Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
19/12/23, 8:45 am - +265 987 57 92 74: No I dont
19/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
19/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
19/12/23, 8:49 am - +265 987 57 92 74: Oh oky I get it
19/12/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Persistance, one of my students has _earned around 7,000 USD_ and paid his entire tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
19/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 8:52 am - +265 987 57 92 74: I have read it
19/12/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
19/12/23, 8:57 am - +265 987 57 92 74: Alright thank u
19/12/23, 8:57 am - +265 987 57 92 74: You*
19/12/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
19/12/23, 9:10 am - +265 987 57 92 74: Yeah very interesting
19/12/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

19/12/23, 9:34 am - +265 987 57 92 74: Done
19/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good day, Sarah! 🎄☀️

Did you know that the tradition of hanging stockings by the fireplace comes from the legend of St. Nicholas? According to the story, St. Nicholas dropped gold coins down the chimney of a poor man's house, and they landed in the stockings that were hanging by the fire to dry. From then on, the tradition stuck, and now many of us hang stockings as part of our Christmas celebrations. 🧦✨
Now that we've kicked off with a festive fun fact, how can I assist you in today's session? 😊🎁
19/12/23, 2:10 pm - +265 987 57 92 74: Help me  with anything you new.

20/12/23, 1:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Sarah! 🎄

To kick off our session with a festive spirit, how about starting with a Christmas-themed icebreaker? I invite you to share something related to the holiday season that holds special meaning for you. It could be a favorite ornament, a cherished holiday recipe, or even a funny holiday-themed anecdote. ✨🧑🏽‍🎄🎄
20/12/23, 1:45 pm - +265 987 57 92 74: Good afternoon
20/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
20/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 2:00 pm - +265 987 57 92 74: Yes it is clear

20/12/23, 2:48 pm - +265 987 57 92 74: I'm done reading now........
Oky the documents is talking more about skills where there are imerging and enduring skills .This skills helps us when searching for the jobs from different organisation.Accordding to my understanding emerging skills are those that involves technology while the enduring skills are the skills which technology can't do for example decision making
20/12/23, 2:48 pm - +265 987 57 92 74: Sorry for the delay I can be a slow reader sometimes
20/12/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We have to conclude our session for today. I wish we could have proceeded for a longer time, but that's alright as we will connect again tomorrow!
