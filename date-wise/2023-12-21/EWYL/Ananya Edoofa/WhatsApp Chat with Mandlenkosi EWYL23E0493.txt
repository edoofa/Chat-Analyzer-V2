10/08/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Yes Ms Ananya
10/08/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tell me about them!
10/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 78 964 6893: The two objectives are the EWYL team  will make sure that I am  prepared for self-financing my  Education in India. Secondly putting my dedicated Efforts in the EWYL program so that  I  earn maximum scholarship
10/08/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
10/08/23, 2:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
10/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Thanks Ms Ananya
10/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
10/08/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/08/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 964 6893: I have read the the Email Ms Ananya
10/08/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

10/08/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Mandlenkosi?

10/08/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

24/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Okey Ms Ananya
24/08/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
24/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Okey Ms Ananya thanks for the information
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 964 6893: Go ahead
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/08/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee.

01/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
01/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
01/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

15/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 8:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263719390324 @263777152664 

I was expecting a response from your end. May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
18/09/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
18/09/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 2:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
20/09/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263719390324 

May I ask if we can move forward with our discussion or not?
21/09/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263719390324 

May I ask if we can move forward with our discussion or not?
20/10/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Parents @263719390324 @263777152664 ✨ 

Our records show that Mandlenkosi has not attended sessions for more than 30 days now. This message serves as an *official notice* from the academic board that prolonged absence from the program may result in the *revocation* of your child's participation in the EWYL program. I sincerely hope to avoid such a situation.

If you are facing any challenges or if any concerns have led to this absence, I urge you to share it with me so that we can have a conversation about it and provide the necessary support.
20/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 939 0324: My apologies Ms Ananya at the moment I am writing examination and I have been preparing for these  examinations, once again my apologies for my absence
20/10/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand your situation, Mandlenkosi. I previously suggested that your parents could complete the fast-track sessions with me. However, I didn't receive a clear response from you. Can we proceed in this manner?
20/12/23, 9:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263719390324 @263777152664 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. I think we should connect today and discuss if something is there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can. What do you think?
