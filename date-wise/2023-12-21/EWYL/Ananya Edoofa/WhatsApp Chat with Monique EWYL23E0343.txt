04/08/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
04/08/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 011 5569: I'm Monique Muzondiwa, I'm 19 years old, I'm a chess lover and I like to try new things, i can say I'm a very curious person. I'm not very social but I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone. Once i get comfortable with someone I tend to be the most talkative person
04/08/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Monique! You know what I like playing chess too!
04/08/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 011 5569: wow, that's awesome
04/08/23, 8:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
04/08/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 011 5569: please enlighten me
04/08/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: So,  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
04/08/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
04/08/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 011 5569: understood, thank you
04/08/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 011 5569: I'm following
04/08/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
04/08/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 011 5569: okay, noted
04/08/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
04/08/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 011 5569: quite inspiring indeed
04/08/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
04/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 011 5569: that is very true each section has its own taste, but i would personally say i liked the 2 Questions for you,
It gives one a moment to reflect on oneself relating to something you have read
04/08/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: With excitement, let's connect at the same time on Monday! Remember, we don't have sessions on Saturday and Sunday!

Both of the projects have quit a lot of things in common, examples being to be able to network, to face rejection and be able to deal with it, they are also focusing on spread the word of what Edoofa is, and what it'll do

14/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 011 5569: I think the first one does not have all the requirements criteria in the sense that it is self owned, I'm sure it doesn't have employees who can get to 100,.
14/08/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.
And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.

I hope you are doing great! I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to connect today because I have some personal work that needs my urgent attention.

Meanwhile, I would recommend you to read the following document. Once you've gone through it, kindly send a practice email to yourself and cc me at ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com before our next session.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately. Actually, we have initiated our orientation program in collaboration with our partner universities, which is why we were present at those institutions.

Since schools are now open, and I don't want you to be diverted from your studies, I would like to ask about your schedule. This will help me plan our proceedings accordingly and ensure that we can stay connected even if you cannot attend your sessions.🤝🏽

25/09/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Monique!

I understand that there are some challenges preventing you from attending your sessions and responding to my messages. However, as your mentor, I would like to know what has happened. I am concerned about whether everything is alright or not.
26/09/23, 9:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!
It is your session time and I am waiting for you on your EWYL line.

Our records show that Monique has not attended sessions for more than 30 days now. This message serves as an *official notice* from the academic board that prolonged absence from the program may result in the *revocation* of your child's participation in the EWYL program. I sincerely hope to avoid such a situation.

If you are facing any challenges or if any concerns have led to this absence, I urge you to share it with me so that we can have a conversation about it and provide the necessary support.
20/12/23, 9:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263780115569 @263775343834 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. I think we should connect today and discuss if something is there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can. What do you think?
