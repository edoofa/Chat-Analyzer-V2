I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
04/09/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Warm Greetings, Student!

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. The icing on the cake? We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

I hope that you are doing well. It has been a while since we last connected. 
I have been reminding you to come for the session so that we can proceed with our scheduled sessions so that you don't miss out on the opportunities to earn scholarship credits and learn from the industrial academia that has been specifically curated for our Edoofians.

May I know what exactly is the challenge?
20/09/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I start school at half seven and finish at 16:30
21/09/23, 9:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Chanice

Thank you so much for informing about this.
21/09/23, 9:49 am - Sharda Edoofa: In such a scenario I want you to take out not more than 10 minutes so that I can discuss an important thing and then we can put your program on Hold until your exams get over.
Kindly make sure you are available for 10 minutes atleast
21/09/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 235 1224: At what time
22/09/23, 7:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Chanice

Excuse me for the delay in reply.
10/10/23, 4:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Chanice* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Chanice* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
10/10/23, 4:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
10/10/23, 4:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *FIRST* - Please know that the  batch for *Chanice’s*  sessions will be :

10/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 235 1224: So there's going to be a new group?
10/10/23, 4:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is called as the EWYL Line. Once Chanice is back, Chanice's sessions will be conducted there.
All you have to do now is join the line on Chanice's behalf.
10/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I am Chanice😊
10/10/23, 10:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Excuse me for the confusion. I thought your parents were attending the session on your behalf.

11/10/23, 1:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *Chanice* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.
11/10/23, 1:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:

There is one mandatory step that you are required to follow in order to put your EWYL Program on hold.
That step is, you have to join the EWYL Line and drop the following message - '*Greetings, Ms. Sharda, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'*
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Edoofa EWYL (contact):  +91 98107 89170
20/10/23, 4:33 am - +263 77 235 1224: But then it says to resume..
20/10/23, 7:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Chanice
I hope you are doing well

By resume it means to say the resuming of discussion on the EWYL Line.
But you will only be resuming the discussions once your exams are  over.
20/10/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 235 1224: Okay
20/10/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 235 1224: Morning

26/10/23, 3:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day Chanice and parents! 
I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.

 It's wonderful to see your interests in basketball, poetry, and dancing. Each of these activities offers a unique form of expression and enjoyment.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.

_Through WhatsApp community groups_
23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

24/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let's start our session with a bit of inspiration:
*"Your attitude determines your direction."*

Now, let's talk about this quote. It means that the way you approach things in life can shape where you're headed. Having a positive mindset and facing challenges with determination can lead to great things.

24/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Okay😊
So my day has been alright, i have been having a lot on my mind ...i would like to learn new languages,if i get the opportunity and also I have been trying to find ways on how to make my poetry be known by many
24/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that your day has been alright, and it sounds like you have exciting aspirations to learn new languages and gain recognition for your poetry. Both are wonderful pursuits!

For learning new languages, there are various approaches you can consider:

    Language Learning Apps: Explore language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel, or Memrise. These platforms offer interactive lessons and exercises to help you build your language skills.

    Online Courses: Platforms like Coursera, edX, or Khan Academy often have language courses taught by universities and language experts. These courses can provide a more structured and comprehensive learning experience.

    Language Exchange: Consider finding a language exchange partner. This involves connecting with someone who wants to learn your native language while you learn theirs. Websites like Tandem or HelloTalk can help you find language exchange partners.

    Immersive Learning: Immerse yourself in the language by watching movies, listening to music, or reading books in the target language. This can help you pick up colloquial expressions and improve your overall language proficiency.
24/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As for making your poetry known, building a presence in the poetry community takes time and effort. Here are some additional tips:

    Create a Poetry Portfolio: Establish a platform to showcase your poetry. This could be a personal blog, a website, or dedicated social media accounts.

    Engage with the Community: Participate in online poetry communities, attend local poetry events, and connect with fellow poets. Engaging with others in the community can provide valuable feedback and support.

    Submit to Journals: Submit your poetry to literary journals and magazines. Getting published in respected outlets can enhance your credibility and expand your audience.

    Utilize Social Media: Share your poetry on social media platforms using relevant hashtags. Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok are great for reaching a broad audience.
24/11/23, 2:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Remember, the key is persistence and a genuine passion for both language learning and poetry. Enjoy the journey, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or need further guidance! 😊

This inspiring quote by Eleanor Roosevelt emphasizes the power of belief in one's dreams. As we embark on our session today, remember that your aspirations are essential, and your efforts pave the way for a brighter future. How are you doing? I'm here to assist and encourage you along the way.
29/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 235 1224: I am well and you
29/11/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am also good, thank you.
29/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations.
29/11/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

STEP 1 - As a proud Edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals or headmasters on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
STEP 2 - ​After that, you will share details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edoofa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
29/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 235 1224: You sent this in our last discussion
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly share the answers of these questions Chanice.

*"Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." - Winston S. Churchill*

Meaning: This quote encourages a resilient mindset. It highlights that success often involves facing failures but maintaining enthusiasm and determination throughout the journey. How are you doing today? Ready to navigate the path to success with resilience and enthusiasm?
30/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Good afternoon
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright.
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
30/11/23, 1:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
30/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 235 1224: Umm ok
30/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I hope this message finds you well. Allow me to introduce myself as a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to share some exciting news.
I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
30/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Chanice, it would be more advantageous if you could tailor and modify this message according to your preferences, and please refrain from sending the same message as is.*
30/11/23, 2:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After the headmaster replies and gives you a specific time for the conversation. You can share detailed information about the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

30/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is Indeed  amazing.
30/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: But you can contact other nearby schools.
30/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
30/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
30/11/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

18/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 77 235 1224: *Honesty and Hard work* 

 _Part 1_ 

There was  boy who came from a poor family ,despite he was a very hardworking boy who tried by all means to help his parents and two sisters in feeding the family

It was just one of the normal , boring and lazy Sundays when a young man came to visit the boy's house..Oh by the way the boy's name was Tambu. Okay back to the story. 
The young man came with a letter which invited young men and boys to work at the kings fields as there had been a surplus harvest and a lot of work needed to be done. Those who would go would be paid handsomely so Tambu found this as an opportunity.
He packed his bag for it was quite a distance to the kings palace and he bid farewell to his family.

 _Part 2_ 

Some hours later , Tambu reached the the king's palace and was welcomed by green fields of maize and a lot of people who had come to grab the price.
They were given some shelter as it was already dusk and they would start work early in the morning before the sun starts poking its fingers in the horizons.
Dawn came and the young men went to the fields and were divided into groups and each was given a portion to work on.

So the task was to remove the green mealies from the plant and put them in big sacks and one would be paid according to the sacks they would have filled

So the young men worked the whole day for 3 consecutive days and Tambu did his best ,after the 3 days he had filled 12 sacks and what surprised him was some from his group had filled over 30 sacks each  ,not knowing that all they did was to fill the their sacks with maize stalks and leaves at the bottom and a few maize cobs at the top hence their sacks filled quicker.
Despite Tambu was still proud of himself and wasn't discouraged for he did what he could

 _Part 3_ 

On the fourth day which was the day of payment and departure , a special announcement was made ,which made some happy and some really sad
 
 _Part 4_ 

"Wow ,we are going to have a wonderful year this year ,due to all this maize we have ," said Tambu's father. "Indeed ,father we thank God for this it is going to be a wonderful year indeed full of food." Both laughed and continued eating their sadza and vegetables with chicken.

 _Part 3_ (Flashback)

 *The announcement read* 

" Good day my fellow people,thank you for working hard and helping me on my fields , i didn't know a lot would come to help hence i don't have much to pay you ,but i as the king will not let you go empty handed hence ,you are to go with the sacks of maize cobs which each one filled..that would be my payment to you all

Yours 

King Chan"

19/12/23, 1:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
*After having a keen observation, I would like to re-iterate a few important pointers that will help us in having a smooth session.*
Recently, there have been some irregularities in your attendance for our sessions on the EWYL Line from your end.
Consistent attendance from you contributes significantly to a dynamic and fruitful learning environment for all.

*Action Plan for an Outstanding Session:*

*Session Schedule:* Our sessions take place twice a week on *Monday and Thursday, from 9:30 am to 11:00 am.*
*Wednesday Lesson:* Every Wednesday, a valuable lesson will be shared on the EWYL Line. Kindly write Wednesday  Lesson on the line before 9:30 am.
*Saturday Activity:* On Saturdays, an engaging activity will be posted on the EWYL Line. Please post Saturday Activity before 9:30 am.
19/12/23, 1:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Session Focus:* During our sessions, we discuss project updates, delve into the Wednesday Lesson, and share responses to the Saturday activity. Ensure sharing your understanding and responses before we start our sessions.
*Punctuality Matters:* Aim to join the line 5 minutes early, confirming your readiness. This small gesture ensures we make the most of our scheduled sessions and unlocks undiscovered benefits.
*Discouraging Reminders:* Instead of relying on constant reminders, let's cultivate the habit of being mindful of our class timings and being available for our scheduled sessions. It speaks volumes about your commitment.
*Daily Affirmation:* Don't forget to maintain the ritual of declaring *'I am a proud Edoofian'* daily on the EWYL Line.
20/12/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
Another quick little Update.

There is *no deadline for the project.*
There is *no order in which you have to do the project.*
There is *no limit on how much you have to do a project.*
There is *no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.*

It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
