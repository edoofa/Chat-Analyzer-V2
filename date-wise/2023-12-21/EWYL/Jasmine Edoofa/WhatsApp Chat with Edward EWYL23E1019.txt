15/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 303 5080: 2.Rights and duties are two important concepts that often go hand in hand. Let's start by understanding each of them individually:

1. Rights: Rights are inherent entitlements or privileges that individuals possess by virtue of their existence as human beings, citizens, or members of a particular society. They represent the freedoms and protections that individuals possess, primarily to ensure their well-being, dignity, and autonomy. These rights are often enshrined in laws, constitutions, or international treaties. Examples of rights include the right to life, liberty, and security, freedom of speech, religion, and association, right to a fair trial, and the right to education, among others.

2. Duties: Duties, on the other hand, refer to the responsibilities and obligations individuals have towards society, the government, or their fellow citizens. These duties are often derived from rights and are necessary to maintain social order, harmony, and the functioning of a civil society. Duties can be legally binding or morally expected. They are typically outlined in laws, regulations, or social norms and may include obligations to pay taxes, serve on a jury, adhere to laws, respect the rights of others, and fulfill contractual agreements, among others.

Now, let's discuss the difference between human rights and civil rights:

1. Human Rights: Human rights are fundamental rights that are inherent to all individuals by virtue of their humanity, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, gender, or any other characteristic. Human rights are universal, indivisible, and inalie

19/12/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.

For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*

2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

20/12/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 303 5080: Ok  noted
20/12/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.

In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
20/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
20/12/23, 9:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Now it is time to wrap up the session*. It was lovely talking to you. _As homework, I would want you to go on this post and drop a comment on where you see yourself in the next 5 years and how the EWYL Program and your mentor that is me will help you do that._
