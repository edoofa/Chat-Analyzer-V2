18/10/23, 11:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa*. In the past few months, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end.
18/10/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that there can be a challenge however, there might be underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing, your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.
18/10/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program in September 2022, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024. Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage.
18/10/23, 11:59 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged us to reach out once more, extending an opportunity for you to openly discuss your concerns, which have been hindering your communication with the team. Our aim is to address these issues and provide you with the necessary guidance and solutions. Your participation is vital in ensuring your continued progress in this journey.

08/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am fine thank you for asking.
20/12/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!
20/12/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
