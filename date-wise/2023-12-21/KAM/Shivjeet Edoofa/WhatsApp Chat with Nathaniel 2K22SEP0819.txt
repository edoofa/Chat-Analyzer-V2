I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*.

I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better.
