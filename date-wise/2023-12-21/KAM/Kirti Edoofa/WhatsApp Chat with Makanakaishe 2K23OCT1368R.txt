09/12/23, 3:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Name of Student: Makanakaishe Mutasa
University Name: MVN University

Registration Fee Due: $1000
Endowment Grant: $150
Fee to be paid by the student/parent: $1000 - $150 = $850

Payment Mode Used: Mr. Charles 
International Transfer Charges: $106 (12.5% of the amount to be paid by the student/parent)

Total amount to be deposited including Charges: $850 + $106 = $956

Amount paid for the due registration fee: $481 (Paid on 25 November 2023)

Balance Amount Due: $956 - $481 = $475

As per the payment plan shared by the university, the remaining balance of $475 is to be paid on or before the due date of 30th December 2023. It's worth noting that the earlier you make this payment, the sooner you'll be able to complete your university admission process.
09/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok noted.
09/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 71 368 2925: But I thought also that as a University, it was going to send a proof of payment in a Pdf form maybe with it's Logo for us to see.  Thus my question.
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Makanakaishe.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours on Saturdays, hence we could not get back to you. Thank you for sharing your query. I would like you to please help me understand the concerns that you have please, because when you made the deposit the receipt was shared by Mr. Charles with you, and by providing the break up above I confirmed your payment and the university you received, so could you please help me understand what exactly is your concern? The Invoice that you are referring to is basically needed when you can process the payment, however, in your case, the payment has already been processed and completed through Mr. Charels and once it was confirmed in India, we shared the same update with the university and hence we provided you with the confirmation breakup above.
11/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, I get you.

My concern is that maybe we should have received a receipt of acknowledgement from the respective University.
11/12/23, 4:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263713682925 let me attend to this query shared by you - The university shall issue an official Admission Acceptance letter once a student completes all admission formalities, including the payment of the entire registration fee. If you wish to receive the letter early for visa application purposes, the sooner you complete the entire payment, the earlier we can assist you with the admission acceptance letter and proceed to the next stages of the process this letter would be an official letter by the university which would act as your receipt for the visa process as well. May I know if you are clear now?
11/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 71 368 2925: Ok, thank you.
18/12/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Makanakaishe.
