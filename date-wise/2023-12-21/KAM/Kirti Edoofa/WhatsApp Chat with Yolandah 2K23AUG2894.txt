06/09/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/09/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes I'm ready we can start
06/09/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/09/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 905 5637: I have gone through it
06/09/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/09/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/09/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes they're all clear
06/09/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/09/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/09/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes they are clear
06/09/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/09/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes they are all clear
06/09/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
06/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes we can proceed
06/09/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/09/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
06/09/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
06/09/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes you can share
06/09/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
06/09/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
06/09/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
06/09/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
06/09/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
06/09/23, 8:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
06/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 77 905 5637: I will go through them tomorrow for now i have network problem to download the videos
06/09/23, 8:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, Can I anticipate that you will be able to go through the videos by tomorrow 09.00 pm?
06/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes
06/09/23, 8:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 pm. I hope you will be available.
06/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes thank you Ms Kirti
06/09/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Have a great night.
07/09/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 905 5637: I have gone through all the videos
07/09/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Yolandah.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, in that case, could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
07/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 905 5637: I understand that we should follow the Edoofa's instructions so that everything will go smoothly

Secondly Edoofa's vision is not just to get students affordable quality education but it also helps students to be more responsible and independent

Thirdly the SOP is an important document, i should  be smart, act smart when filling the SOP form and it takes 1 hour fill it
07/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
07/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
07/09/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school.

08/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 905 5637: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
08/09/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
08/09/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Diploma in Business Administration for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
08/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Oky Ms Kirti
08/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes that is correct
08/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
08/09/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes I'm ready
08/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/09/23, 10:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/09/23, 10:26 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i agree
08/09/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Oky
08/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/09/23, 10:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes she explained it
08/09/23, 10:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
08/09/23, 10:35 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes we are on the same page
08/09/23, 11:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
09/09/23, 7:04 am - +263 77 905 5637: Oky $2800 per annum so if my course is for 3 years then its means i will pay $8400 for the whole course?
09/09/23, 8:42 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Yolandah.

I hope you are doing well, by the time you responded, it was past our available working hours, so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/09/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 905 5637: We are doing well Ms Kirti

Yes now I'm available
09/09/23, 9:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let me help you here better, I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
09/09/23, 9:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
09/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 905 5637: Oky i understand
09/09/23, 10:04 am - +263 77 905 5637: So what happens if my parents could not be able to pay the first installment in first three days of my arriving in India
09/09/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 432 9772: Greetings Mr Kirti, so does that means we have to pay the registration fee even without the O-Level result
09/09/23, 10:14 am - Kirti Edoofa: May I know why you think that your parents will not be able to pay the first installment, since your admission is for August 2024, you have almost a years time to prepare mentally and financially for your higher education?
09/09/23, 10:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263784329772, yes you are correct, the universities will be able to generate the offer letter from the Statment of Entry, and the registration fee that you will be paying is not an extra cost incurred by you it is part of your first-year tuition fee, which you will be required to pay while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted towards your first-year tuition fee, hence, making your registration fee $0.

I hope you are clear now?
09/09/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i know that we have almost a year to prepare
09/09/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/09/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
09/09/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/09/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/09/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 432 9772: Ok what if she doesn't have the required subjects for the course
09/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 905 5637: Oky
09/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 905 5637: Oky i understand
09/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 905 5637: So far i don't have any query
09/09/23, 10:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: @263784329772 let me help you understand, During the counseling sessions, her eligibility for the course was checked along with the subject combination, and then only our counselor recommended the course, so please do not worry about that.

I hope you are clear?
09/09/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 432 9772: Oky i understand now
09/09/23, 10:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the process now we start with the next step which I am sure you will be very excited to begin I was going through your EWYL Program Pledge form and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey by 18th September 2023, considering the reasons you've provided. With this in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL Program in September as agreed upon.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, shall we move ahead with our discussions?
09/09/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 905 5637: Yes we can move forward
09/09/23, 10:59 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
09/09/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 905 5637: I wasn't aware of the opportunity
09/09/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: I understand Yolandah, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
09/09/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
09/09/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 905 5637: Wow this is great i now understand
09/09/23, 11:10 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
09/09/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 905 5637: Yes this will relieve them a lot
09/09/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i would like to know more
09/09/23, 11:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
09/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 905 5637: Yes I'm
09/09/23, 11:29 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/09/23, 11:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the O-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
09/09/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 905 5637: i understand everything
09/09/23, 12:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
09/09/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. As you await your O-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
09/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes it is clear
09/09/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/09/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Students now have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/09/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i get it
09/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/09/23, 12:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/09/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes
09/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 1, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 1, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 1, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/09/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 905 5637: No i don't have any question.
09/09/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that now before we proceed to discuss the remaining two points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your O-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 905 5637: I would like you to provide me with more information about that
09/09/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their O-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
09/09/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Diploma degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their O-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
09/09/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
09/09/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i understand now
11/09/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Yolandah.

I hope you are doing well, since it was the weekend, hence we could not get back to you, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
11/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Greetings Ms Harmehak we are all doing well

Yes I'm available
11/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well, great so may I know if you are clear here?
11/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes I'm
11/09/23, 9:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their Diploma's education anywhere in the world, right?
11/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i understand it
11/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is good to know, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in O Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career ((Benefit Number 6)*
11/09/23, 10:02 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i agree with it
11/09/23, 10:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
11/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. Reappear in O Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, that is reappearing in the O Level exams, In such a case, I believe Yolandah will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2023 and once her results come in 2024, she will be able to join the August 2024 batch and pursue her Diploma degree then.
11/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
11/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i understand this one
11/09/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great Now, let us move forward to the last point, 2. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account
11/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Oky on this i will be here in my home country right?
11/09/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please since your intake is for August 2024, and you will be commencing your EWYL Program while you are in your home country.
11/09/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Oky i understand it Ms Kirti
11/09/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 6 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 6 points clear?
11/09/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes they are all clear Ms Kirti
11/09/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your parents concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. Let us reconnect tomorrow same time and please make sure that your parents are available too.
11/09/23, 10:28 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Oky Ms Kirti thank you
11/09/23, 10:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, have a great night.
12/09/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Yolandah. 

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
12/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Good evening Ms Kirti  I'm available
12/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, I hope you were able to have a discussion as a family by now so I'm interested in knowing how the discussion went regarding the advantages of early decision benefits, as we discussed previously?
12/09/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 905 5637: The discussion went well they were all pleased with the early decision benefits
12/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
12/09/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 905 5637: From what we discussed previous they don't have any query

My mother will join us soon she is busy right now
12/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
12/09/23, 9:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
12/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
12/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes we're on the same page
12/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Oky when my mom is free she will join us
12/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
12/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
12/09/23, 9:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
12/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes I'm clear
12/09/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
12/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes you can help me to understand the difference between the two
12/09/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 12th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 27th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
12/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yed I'm clear
12/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
12/09/23, 10:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
12/09/23, 10:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 12th of September, the deadline becomes the 27th of September, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 12th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 27th of September 2023, making the second deadline the 27th of October, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
12/09/23, 10:06 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i understand this
12/09/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
12/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes i have understand the difference between proceed as per the standard procedure and proceed with the early decision benefits
12/09/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
12/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 77 905 5637: In standard procedure my registration fee will be $500 _$750  and   have to be payed within 15 days

And proceed with the early decision benefits my registration will be $600 Edoofa will pay $150 and i will pay the $600 in two parts
12/09/23, 10:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
12/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Yes I'm clear
12/09/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
12/09/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *27th September* and *27th October*.
12/09/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would want your parents to be active and if they are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *27th September* and *27th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
12/09/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 905 5637: I think they will be able to reply tomorrow morning  i believe they will give you the go ahead
12/09/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please in that case, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 pm. I hope your parents will be available.
12/09/23, 10:36 pm - +263 77 905 5637: Oky Ms Kirti
12/09/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a great night.
13/09/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 432 9772: Greetings Mrs KirtiI was going through your massages they are all clear, I will reconnect with you at 8pm after discussing with my husband right now I'm at the funeral that's why I was not available last night

14/09/23, 3:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *27th September* and *27th October*), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Yolandah's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
14/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 432 9772: Yes you can go-ahead with the application
14/09/23, 3:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Yolandah's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Yolandah's  higher education well.

14/09/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.

With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
21/09/23, 1:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Yolandah

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Lovely Professional University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
20/12/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM CAT.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
20/12/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM CAT, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
