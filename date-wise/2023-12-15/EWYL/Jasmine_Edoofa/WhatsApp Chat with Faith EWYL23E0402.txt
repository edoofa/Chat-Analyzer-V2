29/08/23, 9:34 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

15/09/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
17/09/23, 8:13 am - +260 97 7414512: Morning
17/09/23, 8:14 am - +260 97 7414512: 1:30pm to 2:30pm
17/09/23, 8:23 am - +260 97 7414512: Am sorry for taking so long to respond. I had to ask the school if faith could be allowed to attend the session as she is in a boarding school
17/09/23, 8:26 am - +260 97 7414512: She has been allowed to attend on Tuesday 1:30pm
18/09/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 7414512: I am looking forward to the journey with the Edoofa program
18/09/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Definitely, Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/09/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 7414512: No
18/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Faith is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 2:37 pm - +260 97 7414512: Well understood
18/09/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 3:09 pm - +260 97 7414512: Ok
18/09/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

19/09/23, 1:43 pm - +260 97 9386837: Yes

19/09/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Faith to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
19/09/23, 1:48 pm - +260 97 9386837: Yes
19/09/23, 1:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

19/09/23, 1:57 pm - +260 97 9386837: I have read it
19/09/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Faith’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Faith?
19/09/23, 2:02 pm - +260 97 9386837: That sounds great
19/09/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
19/09/23, 2:05 pm - +260 97 9386837: Yes
19/09/23, 2:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

19/09/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 9386837: Yes it is clear
19/09/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Faith can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 9386837: Yes

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Shalom is available? If no then, 
1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one you choose?
