Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations.

I hope you all are in great health and spirits. So, the day has come when I will be explaining to you about the *EDOOFA GRANT 2023* 🎓
There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 10:04 am - +91 77079 38131: Good afternoon mam
17/08/23, 10:06 am - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam thank you

17/08/23, 2:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good, Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
17/08/23, 3:00 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam
17/08/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 3:01 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
17/08/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 3:05 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam , it's that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment,  so the grant is there to support such students
17/08/23, 3:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 3:07 pm - +91 77079 38131: Thank you mam
17/08/23, 3:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
17/08/23, 3:13 pm - +91 77079 38131: Thank you mam
17/08/23, 3:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 3:24 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
17/08/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, have you signed the document?
17/08/23, 3:32 pm - +91 77079 38131: I will do that tomorrow mam
17/08/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

17/08/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

25/11/23, 1:42 pm - +91 77079 38131: The competitive spirit is a crucial skills. It fosters success,  competitive spirit pushes us to go beyond our expectations,  it can also help in determining our short term as well as long term goals , moreover competitive spirit helps at to work an extra hard on given tasks ,hence excelling in everything we do , 
It is also crucial in businesses as it helps in generating ideas of increasing profits and product positioning as well as customer loyalty
25/11/23, 1:52 pm - +91 77079 38131: Spirit of competition involves focusing attention and creating individual ownership of the big picture goals of the whole team. Competition leads to people doing their personal best being the driver for success, but it can also lead to toxic ego driven mentality which undermines and destroys team objectives and company culture.

As a student I might say spirit of competition is very very helpful as it leads to progress .

Talking of my real life example , when I was at Advanced level , we had academic competition in our class especially in commercial subjects. Everyone wanted to be the best . Because of this competition I could calculate accounting everyday,  it was now part of my meals per day , moreover I became the best student in Accounting.  This shows the importance and results of the spirit of competition.
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon
I hope you are doing well.

27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: How are you doing?
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - +91 77079 38131: I'm doing great mam , how are you
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge; that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $300 annually. 
Do you remember this? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam
27/11/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please share it with me
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - +91 77079 38131: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
27/11/23, 4:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 4:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 77079 38131: Thank you mam
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
27/11/23, 4:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

27/11/23, 4:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:35 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
27/11/23, 4:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Nyasha, May I know that are your parents in the session?

27/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 71 915 4689: My opinion is mam do something for your student to qualify yhis month, also may you furnish the scholarship credits which are redeemable this coming semester for us to know the fees due
28/11/23, 8:43 am - +91 77079 38131: Mam but , in September I attended,  then in October most of the webinars and sessions I was sick , I had dengue fever mam ,

*IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*

May I know do you remember yesterday's conversation?
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yesterday we talked about the grand , and the eligibility to redeem the grand
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 77079 38131: Grant
28/11/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Merely sending a message and disappearing won't be considered as keeping me informed.
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 77079 38131: Ok mam,  but I was so sick
28/11/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I'm truly sorry to hear about your situation, Nyasha. However, as this is a standard process, in case of illness, you could have communicated by texting me every time I sent session reminders, or reached out to Mr. Rithvik.
28/11/23, 4:11 pm - +91 77079 38131: Ok mam
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.

29/11/23, 12:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, I comprehend the situation. However, despite my attempts to seek clarification by reaching out to her, she was unable to reply. At the very least, I expect that when she gets better, it is her responsibility to return to me and discuss the matter.
I hope you would understsand.
29/11/23, 12:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No dear. If you will be in regular touch with me and you will complete all the tasks, you will definitely be able to redeem grant.
29/11/23, 1:07 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted with thanks

a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

_*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_
This is to remind you that since we were unable to complete our discussion yesterday. *I have scheduled one last session for you.*
Make sure you come on time. 
I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. 

*Date: 30/11/2023*

It's time for your session

Kindly confirm your presence
30/11/23, 2:34 pm - +91 77079 38131: Good afternoon mam
30/11/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Nyasha, do you remember our Grant discussion?
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 915 4689: Good afternoon mam
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 77079 38131: Good evening
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam , we discussed on the eligibility to redeem the grant
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - +91 77079 38131: Sorry for being late mam , I came late from school today
30/11/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth.

30/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
30/11/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
30/11/23, 3:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
30/11/23, 3:29 pm - +91 77079 38131: Ok
30/11/23, 3:29 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
30/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 77079 38131: Yes mam
30/11/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 77079 38131: Surely we will achieve it , on the 8 forms I will definitely find them
30/11/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
30/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 77079 38131: Noted mam
30/11/23, 3:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
30/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 77079 38131: Thank you mam
30/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Our conversation regarding the grant has concluded.

It was a pleasure discussing this matter with you.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made.

04/12/23, 4:51 am - +91 77079 38131: Good morning mam
04/12/23, 11:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Nyasha
How are you doing?
04/12/23, 12:58 pm - +91 77079 38131: I'm doing good mam , how are you
04/12/23, 1:11 pm - +91 77079 38131: The Earn while you learn program have been so so helpful in my my life,  I have learnt a lot , I have also learnt the importance of putting extra effort in everything through the Wednesday wisdom.

In respect to Earn While You Learn Program,  when I was still in Zimbabwe during the 21st grand challenge,  I managed to produce 22 forms , and I managed to visit a total of 10 schools in which only 6 gave me the details I needed in respect to project 3 , moreover besides the 21st grant I also gave some forms in line with the community building project of which , one of those students Alexio have already paid the admission fee .

Talking about the challenges I faced, I can say in community building,  Africans don't understand the meaning of scholarship,  they think when one is on scholarship she will be studying for free moreover all the Expenses will be catered for , everything will be for free hence it becomes difficult for me to convince them about Edoofa. Moreso Scammers are increasing especially those Talking about scholarships hence it is now difficult to get attention of Africans when Talking about scholarship of studying abroad .

To improve these challenges , African students in India should provide videos telling other fellow Zimbabweans that Edoofa is real , and we can be able to convince people through those videos since it will be now realistic .

To improve my project results, I will further share my group link to many people and many platforms and explain about Edoofa,  give the overviews , share realistic videos of Edoofians here in India , give them my pictures in India , then share the Offline Application Form to them
04/12/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Nyasha

09/12/23, 7:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
09/12/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
09/12/23, 4:38 pm - +91 77079 38131: Thank you mam
09/12/23, 4:41 pm - +91 77079 38131: But mam I have a question,  

Back in Zimbabwe during the 21st grand challenge. You gave me a target to work on inorder to win the grand , I worked very hard according to the task you gave and got the challenge but still I have to work again for that same grand inorder to redeem it , why so , if it was working to get another one it was going to be reasonable,  coz honestly this discouraged me I have lost the energy , how can I be dancing on one position mam
09/12/23, 8:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Absolutely! When you worked hard for the 21-day grant challenge, you earned the grant as a reward. Now, when you receive a grant, you have to follow certain rules mentioned in the grant. These rules are quite fair, like attending the EWYL Program and webinars.

Think of it this way: Imagine you get a scholarship in school because you're doing well in your studies. To keep that scholarship, you need to maintain good grades every year. If your grades drop, you might lose the scholarship. It's similar with the grant – you have to stick to the rules to keep it. I hope that makes it clearer!
10/12/23, 4:51 am - +91 77079 38131: Yaah but on that case you will be focusing on one issue of maintaining good grades , unlike on the case of grand , you will be working on school work , facing pressure from school and also trying to attend webinars , sessions despite the pressure of assignments, CAs exam , truly it's difficult to Balance and it all depends on the program one will be doing if the program is less demanding then that can be manageable
11/12/23, 8:15 am - +263 71 915 4689: But truly it's not fair madam, this demotivates mam, she really wored hard, but all in vein, all those efforts going for no reward?
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening @917707938131 @263719154689 @264857817417 
I completely understand, but kindly review this table first. Nyasha has attended only 3 out of 10 sessions in the past three months. Even if she encounters challenges, I sincerely hope she can communicate with me and share her situation.
11/12/23, 4:09 pm - +91 77079 38131: Well noted mam , but as I said working on one position is so boring mam , when then will we start working for other grands
11/12/23, 4:09 pm - +91 77079 38131: Grants
11/12/23, 6:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sorry, Can you please elaborate?
11/12/23, 6:36 pm - +91 77079 38131: Mam , all I'm saying is I worked very hard for the grant without rest and rested when I got it only to realize that the struggle is still continuing and the grant is distributed throughout the course of my program,  so it means I will be working so hard the whole three years for the same grant , mam this is totally unfair
13/12/23, 11:14 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

13/12/23, 1:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
